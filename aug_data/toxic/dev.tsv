I'm just guessing here, but some of the posters below seem to have forgotten that Alaska is part of the United States. So is Washington. The really cool thing is citizens of these 50 states can actually travel to other states. Without a passport! AND they can get jobs in those different states. Awesome, huh?	0
So much for blaming Harper for the Liberals approving the sale of armoured personnel carriers to Saudi Arabia.  The canard that there would be massive penalties with just Liberal smoke and mirrors, and the Star bought it.	0
Tests of function are desperately needed so as to obtain convictions and remove these dangerous drivers from the road.   IMMAD is a simple app for a tablet that objectively measures functional impairment.  It measures the visual field deficits (HUGE BLIND SPOTS or TUNNEL VISION) that occurs with marijuana use.  Marijuana has been shown to significantly impair the eye retinal ganglion cells.  IMMAD - Impairment Measurement Marijuana and Driving, measures this.   IMMAD and other tests of function need to be further developed and studied so as to have better tools for law enforcement to use in dealing with marijuana impaired driving. Washington found that MJ positive drivers in a fatal crash were 5X more likely to kill someone other than themselves compared to alcohol positive drivers.  This means a bicyclist, pedestrian, passenger or other driver. It follows, if there is a large area of blind/absent/defective vision the MJ impaired driver would not see the person or object.	0
"He should be sent back to the where he comes from...I really doubt he was an established resident of the State before he was homeless.  The same goes for the Hoskins'...send them back to Chicago.  A pole should be taken on where each homeless came from before being homeless.  Were they established Hawaii residents or just came here because we have gutless politicians who really want to deal with the out of state homes population?  Too many ""bleeding hearts"" in our State amount the general public and our politicians!  No one wants to really wants to resolve the homeless problem!"	0

No, your response is what's pathetic. I have two children in this school who are now fluent in Mandarin. Someday they'll have job opportunities that millions of their peers will not.

It is just matter of opinion you look at Obama's tyranny as a good thing and use for the right reasons. Republicans on the other hand have a completely different opinion. Actually I am not quite as concerned about Obama's tyranny because Trump is slowing undoing much of damage it did to the country. It was however an eye opening experience to the American citizens of what can happen when we put aside American values and start buying into the dream of that ever illusive Socialist utopia.	0

The CDF used to be a part of a larger system of censorship where all Catholic scholars would seek imprimater  and nihil obstat from their local ordinary and his theologians, with the CDF as a resource for that process.  Going outside that process could get you on the Index of Forbidden Books.  The CDF is a vestige of that process, most of which was gotten rid of in Vatican II and the papal degrees thereafter.  Nowadays, if the CDF condemns your book, sales go through the roof.  If you look at books that were once on the Index, you will find some of the best works of science and literature.  So much for the infallibility of the Holy Office.	0
I smile when I see log trucks hauling logs to the mills out Noti way. It means the folks here in West Lane county have work which translates to money flowing into our community.

Come on Pandora, you know better than to assume your positive experience in one parish is not evidence for what generally happens. Jim offers his contrary experience, and I could provide a double story of an FC that, under one pastor, controlled funds without interference; and under the next, rubber stamped the pastor's unquestioned decision.   Fact is, FC's are canonically required but advisory; and actual practice almost always is at the mercy of the pastor.	0
"The traditional word was ""game hogs"" in the early 20th century for what is now termed ""slob hunters"".

"""When it’s not empty and forlorn, it’s a hangout for people who make it an unappealing place to have a cup of coffee or a slice of pizza.""  In other words, poor people. As long as the intent is to get rid of them, this is naked class warfare. They have as much right as anyone else to be in any public space. The City Manager, with the tacit consent of the City Council, has already removed every bench in downtown where people could sit without paying money. Tables and chairs were removed from Kesey Square, making it as unfriendly to the public as possible. A low wall across the street that people used to sit on was removed.  Improve the space to make it more friendly and attractive, but don't build anything on it."	0

Public schools need to learn from private schools and structure themselves in the same way. Private schools get better results overall for three reasons: networks and networking: they hardwire high aspiration and the parents make sure the children are on the right paths and aiming high; high education standards with a solid curriculum; discipline and deportment: this is also a big factor in future success. Learning social skills and how to dress and behave makes a big difference in work and career success.	0
"Here we go again ""Trump lost the popular vote""  as if that makes his Presidency illegitimate.  John Kennedy lost the popular  vote when  he defeated Nixon,  was his Presidency illegitimate!

Do the readers of this heretical publication ever read the writings of St. Paul who clearly condemns the sexaul perversion that the NCR apparenlty approves of? If you are a real Catholic do not be deceived by the opinions of this paper. I refer you to Romans and  1st Corinthians. NCR is not biblically based. It is the work of Satan. Take notice of this massive deception by its illegal use of the word Catholic in its name. It is not Catholic. It is not Christian. It is a secular humanistic publication.	0

"To comply with Real ID Act, the states must agree to link up their databases.   Specifically, the Real ID Act says the act provide electronic access by all approved jurisdictions to information contained in the motor vehicle databases of all other states.""  (included in the approved jurisdictions are several Mexican states and Canadian provinces)   Barry Steinhardt, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's technology and liberty program, says: ""It's going to result in everyone, from the 7-Eleven store to the bank and airlines, demanding to see the ID card. They're going to scan it in. They're going to have all the data on it from the front of the card...It's going to be not just a national ID card but a national database.""   Make no mistake, these are national ID cards and the linked databases create a national database."	0

"Regarding: """"The mandate reflected a view that religious freedom is really just about a freedom to worship on the Sabbath and believe in the privacy of your home,"" said Richard W. Garnett, professor of law at the University of Notre Dame and director of the university's Program on Church, State and Society."" - Religious liberty is about being able to practice one's own religion no matter where one is. That is, one may  pray before meals in a restaurant, say the rosary while standing on a curb, fast all day without fanfare, go to church anytime of day or of week... - Religious liberty is not about making associations or corporations self identified as a church or church-like into a 'person' with rights. In fact religious liberty requires churches and their designated leaders to not act in secular or civil society in such a way as the norms of the institutions are required of others. - The USCCB has done a disservice to all by misinterpreting religious liberty."	0

"""Upper level management does. They have to.""  None that I know of.  But there are exceptions when they act like a first grader.  Let me give you an example from your hero:  Donald Trump's temper-tantrum tactics have been explained by the man himself. To the satisfaction of, likely many, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination admitted to his biographer that, ""When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same.   You still don't get it.  Trump is the swamp.  How can he drain himself?  Ask all those people trump fired how loyal he is.  Narcissistic people only think of themselves and he is the very definition of narcissistic.  Well documented."	0

I feel for her but bottom line is, she is UNlicensed.  The article does state that a license does not guarantee proper care, but it does guarantee that certain expectations are met, and closure is possible if not.  The dangerous thing is that a violation could also result in death.  Perhaps this issue also needs to have an inspection system in place similar to the restaurants with the green, yellow, red placards.  BTW, I also thing this article could be related to the monster homes article.....	0
Please expend on your comment.  Looking at the pictures, it isn't clear how cars get from east 19th to US 6 in either direction.  The story kept on talking about the park and whatnot but it didn't say exactly how cars get from one road to another.  Freeway-type ramps?  How many lanes east and west over the bridge?  Are the ramp lanes double lanes?  Where do bikes and pedestrians cross 19th?	0

Kr55, instead of ranting why not make the case for counting up greenhouse emissions from the tankers and from the burning of imported oil in eastern Canada and from the mile-long rail shipments. That should amount to quite an offset against the impact of western oil. It also would suggest there are rational ways to resolve legitimate concerns about climate change.	0

Obviously we can't ask your clients.  But most of us either have direct experience dealing with advisers or know others who have had first hand experiences.  Unfortunately there is more of a consensus that your average client feels like they have overpaid and the adviser has under delivered.  While no one should expect to earn 8% annualized without putting in some effort - paying fees of 2% or more to earn less than 8% suggests that a lot of advisers aren't putting in much effort.	0

Your point is lost in the mis-applied sarcasm of an incorrect political interpretation of the facts. You accuse that because we are all forced to use fossil fuels for our homes and vehicles, anyone who uses it and complains is a hypocrite. That point is simplistic and incomplete. It's largely due to the relentless misinformation campaign paid for by the coal, and petroleum industries that we have not been using solar, or wind, or natural gas, or hydrogen for years now to power our homes and vehicles. We know too much now, and the stakes are too high, not to complain about the lack of intelligent action to address the problem.	0

"Little 75, you said, ""The urban areas are not wealthy and rural regions are not poor.""  This statement is demonstrably false. While one can find rich or poor individuals, anywhere, my statement had nothing to do with that. It concerned wealth in the AGGREGATE.  The Front Range urban centers, and the ski resort areas, drive this state's economy. Take a look at the most recent report produced by the Division of Property Taxation of the Colorado Department of Local Affairs:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vz6H4k4SESN0VfRWpSX2VnQXc/view  Starting on page 35 of the pdf (page 25 of the report), it provides aggregate property values for each county. Page 40 of the pdf (page 30 of the report) lists the aggregate value of the personal property in each county, subject to taxation.  Page 66 of the pdf (page 56 of the report) shows the aggregate valuations in each county. Only one rural county -- Weld, with its oil and gas -- even begins to compare with the Front Range urban centers."	0

Consider this Krammer: If the US taxes Mexican imports then the products become more expensive for US purchasers.  It is the US citizens or buyers of the Mexican imports who will pay.       Further, a tariff on Mexican imports will devalue the peso (as has already happened) thus making the imports even cheaper!     Trumps' proposal is simplistic and most economists don't expect it to lead to long term growth in the US.  It did generate votes though and has apparently jigged a few others along the way.	0

"Um, how does that work exactly, Wavemaker.  Tags might help regulate, but licenses don't.  Licenses  are just a control and fundraiser thing.  Note that tags are generally free (not all, but most), and most fish species don't require a tag anyway.  ""How many fishies one can catch"" is determined by per day/in possession and has nothing to do with fishing licenses."	0
Sorry but I will respectfully disagree with you. The mere utterance of racially or ethnically disrespectful words is not now, nor has it ever been, a crime.

You're right that a convention alone will not solve all our problems. Constitutional reform Is only one part of a broader movement for reform, including building a viable political opposition.  I think that a grassroots political movement is not mutually exclusive from calling for a constitutional convention. In fact, the two complement each other.	0

"Last time I checked, the world comprised of more than 200 countries, not just the nine in this report.   Having read the report, the methodology is quite flawed, it compares housing and lot sizes which differ across countries altogether as indicated in the report: ""there are differences in house types, housing characteristics and lot size between the geographies covered. The Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey does not adjust the Median Multiples to reflect these differences. For example, the average size of housing, particularly new housing, is abnormally small by New World standards in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.""  Don't get me wrong, housing prices in Vancouver have gone up dramatically (I just got my property assessment so I know) but what $1million will get you in Vancouver is greater than in Hong Kong, UK and some US cities. The big difference in affordability is not the housing prices but the low income of Vancouverites compared to he other countries."	0

Our president is not elected by democracy. It's a represented republic. It was designed to prevent what happened to the Roman Empire. Where everyone moved to city centers so that they were represented. See if you lived in the city, you had lower taxes, while the burden was placed on rural areas. They started having food shortages, because people refused to be in the country because of the higher burden of tax. The cities where ultimately a service industry, they shifted to mostly import of goods. They collapsed. See our founding fathers, wanted equal representation to prevent collapse. To prevent a group of wolves from deciding everything for a few sheep, so to speak. 5 times in our history has the president won electoral college and lost the popular vote. Out of 200+ years, only 20 years has a president not won both and all 5 times it was a separation of less than .5% of the voter and less than .0025 % of the actual population. That's how close this separation is.	0
Why do white people want to control what non-white people do? Recently we’ve seen the white supremacist president of America tell predominantly non-white football players to stand up during the anthem even though they have a constitutionally-protected right to protest.  And then now this predominantly white government in a predominantly white province makes a law that tells all 20 burka-wearing women in Quebec, “WE get to tell you what to wear.”  Truly unfathomable in a pluralized democracy. Might be more of a “pure laine theocracy” run amok.  But what’s up with telling us what to do? Y’all feelin your “power” slipping away?	0

"There is never a shortage of ethics provided there be a steady supply of money.  Ethics has been commoditized. Only distinguishable and unique by the amount of money needed to establish a value for the exchange. When I went to college (university) there were two course that were required in my field of study.  One was ethics and the other was logic.  Both were entry level courses. That was a long time ago.  Just a little while after the dinosaurs and even a short time after Diogenes and other notable philosophers roamed this planet.  Today, what I hear as a popular phrase is, ""it's all good"".  Well, I vaguely remember a time when things were not characterized by being totally or all good.  There was ambiguity, self examination and a small thing located between you heart and you head called a conscience. I personally do not like committee work... to complicated."	0
I would like to know how much money the Federal government paid to reimburse the state of Hawaii and the City and County of Honolulu for expenses incurred to protect President Obama and his family during their annual vacations in Hawaii and for APEC.

Pointing out what is unacceptable behavior to my kids as they grew up they learned what is and is not socially acceptable behavior. And they learned to stand up for against bullies and defend themselves from unwanted sexual advances. That the American people(the 25% who voted for trump anyway) are okay with the vileness of trump is beyond comprehension for them and hundreds of millions of other Americans who were raised with the same standards of decency. Calling reprehensible behavior just that is what I would expect from my fellow Americans before this election happened. We are in very strange and dangerous territory now that sexual assault is overlooked for the sake of electing the man representing the tribe you obviously belong to. My daughters were shocked to tears by the incomprehensible ability of Americans to overlook trumps words and deeds towards not just women but virtually every minority demographic in America.	0

I live in the northeast, as does one of my sons.  I have been following discussions on modifying the annulment process.  On the whole my family, including those who attend weekly mass, give little credence to proposals to simplify this process.  Sometimes valid marriages fail and as long as the Church cannot accept this and move on its statements will be considered silly.  Ditto statements on birth control and homosexuality.  The Church can remain firm but will have to accept a smaller Catholic world.  Of course, there are a number of  practicing Catholics who just ignore Church teachings they don't approve of and continue to live what they consider a fine, acceptable Catholic life.	0

"People tend to get very emotional on this subject but if you look at this objectively you'll see what Kerry is saying is true.  Either you move towards peace and create two states OR you move towards peace and create one state, in which case you won't really be a democratic state anymore. But a prerequisite to either is that settlement building must stop.  Once you've built up too much, peace becomes impossible.  Yet, settlements continue to be built, and from that I would conclude that Israel(or the current government) has zero interest in peace.  That for decades they've just been paying lip service to that idea.  What they really want is to get rid of all palestinians.  They want a constant state of turmoil so that they can expand and built out under the guise of ""defense and security"".  They don't want two states.  They don't want one state.  You really have to ask yourself, what do they want?"	0
"I think there's something hidden in plain sight here.  What CNN was doing was alerting the Trump trolls secondarily, but more importantly, the White House, that they, in fact hold the cards.

Any number of things that would tear the White House apart if it became known they had sponsored the advertisement of the work of a known menace to society.  Trump's cadre doesn't exactly have the best reputation.  Association with the worst is the last thing they want.  You have no idea what they knew.

Lots of misinformation this morning from our Russian and leftist readers of the G&M.  There was an attack in April.  Many people died without the signs of war wounds.  This is yet another example of the renegade government of Syria using chemical weapons against its' own people.  It has killed thousands in this manner- all caught on video and reported by 60 minutes 3 yers ago and actual evidence located at the bombing site. These are war crimes of the greatest magnitude. al Assad and his henchmen will be held accountable.  After the fall of Raqqa, it will become a clean up op which includes the Syrian government.  The Trump foreign doctine appears to be total defeat of terrorism on the battlefield.  There is no getting around the fact that Mosul and Raqqa are mortal blows to ISIL.

Rising personnel costs are something we better get used to. The state is in budget crisis largely due to massive payments that must be made to PERS, and it won't stop this year. There will be more huge payments required in coming years, and there is no way out of it.  Our choice locally and statewide is to keep complaining and vowing that we won't support any new taxes, or swallow hard and realize we have a bill to pay if we are to maintain any semblance of public services.  The Legislature had an opportunity this session to address Oregon's tax system in a fair and progressive way. Instead they have squandered this session with a single-minded obsession on the gross receipts tax, massively unfair to business and a huge transfer of tax burden to low and middle income people.  Oregon needs tax reform true, but within the taxes we have, which have the potential to be fair and progressive. Increase the corporate income tax and and add new top rates for millionaires to personal income tax.	0

When I lived in Rome, I used to attend services at the Cistercian (Trappist) abbey of Tre Fontane. I've always been impressed by the Cistercian Reform of the Cluniac Liturgy, which consisted of stripping the Liturgy of all additions and celebrating it as it was meant to be celebrated, without accretions. The prayers are said with great respect, not intoned, and the parts meant to be chanted are chanted, not recited. Each gesture has a meaning, and no gestures are added. The result, in my opinion, is a Liturgy that speaks for itself: both simple and powerful, and one that doesn't require innovation. I think we've lost that in our parishes and we try to compensate by belting out the Lord's Prayer and holding hands.	0

And why didn't Alaska have a medical dispensary system?  Alaska approved medical marijuana in what was it, 1998?  Russ is on to something, because conservative Republican legislators neutered that initiative as soon as they had the chance (if I recall, Loren Leman led the charge in that instance).  Approval for medical marijuana became Alaska's version of a scarlet letter, which caused most folks to decide that consuming cannabis outside of the law was a preferable alternative.  Quite possibly, that could have had as much to do with the results of two years ago as Charlo What's-Her-Name and the ensuing media circus.	0

This suggestion of an imperialist Russia is a figment and bait to lure people into supporting NATO and USA imperialism and aggression. Russia has shown no inclination towards expanding, and has not initiated conflict with any of its neighbours. Crimeans had sought to rejoin Russia for over 25 years, ever since their high-turnout January 1991 referendum saw them vote 94.6% in favour to leave Ukraine and become an autonomous republic of the USSR - but then the USSR dissolved, and Crimeans reluctantly settled for an autonomous region inside of Ukraine (low voter turnout, bare majority support). The matter of Crimea returning to Russia was polled constantly since 1991, and every pollster, including the UN, always found large majority support among Crimeans for returning to Russia. And post 2014-referendum, all polls similarly show 85% + support for the outcome of the referendum. There is no question that returning to Russia was the genuine democratic will of the Crimean people.	0

I was simply pointing out a very basic fact:  Carrington has had more drug and alcohol related problems than any other Duck football player, including Cliff Harris.

Or will ordinances allowing no parking apts include language which mandates that said apts will always and only be rented for 30% less than market rate on similar sized apts with parking?	0

"Bill:  IMO, the first step to improvement in anything is to identify the problems which need to be addressed....to identify the ""shortcomings"", then to plan and take actions toward improvement.  ""looking at the negative"" does not, IMO, lead to depression....""dwelling on the negative"" does.  If my car won't start I can whine about it, I can say ""or well"" and start walking, or I can say ""geez, I'd better fix it"" and do so.  The first, indeed, leads to depression; the second ignores the problem and the third is a positive quest for a solution.  I'll take the third option every time.  regards, Gary Crum"	0

"People seam to be unaware of some realities about the CBC and the rest of Canadian Media.  The CBC mandate requires more that simply being a broadcaster. It has to provide both English and french services in all area's of Canada. It has massive archives of Canadian material that it has to store and Maintain. a heavy involvement in the arts and protection of Canadian culture. If the CBC only had to follow the rules of other broadcaster in Canada it would be Profitable.    And the other broadcasters in Canada are heavily subsidised. So please stop the ""they don't get a dime of our money"". No the other broadcasters don't get a dime of your money they get millions of dollars of it."	0

I understand why Kerry made his comments when he did.  The end of the Obama's term in office is an appropriate time to highlight the objective truth that a democratic Israel cannot survive a one state solution and that the actions of the current Government of Israel make a two-state solution increasingly improbable.  An earlier statement of this nature would only have complicated US-Israel relations to no useful end.  I understand Canada's statement.  It's implicitly in support of Kerry's statement but avoids getting into a useless standoff with the current Government of Israel.  I don't understand the Federal Conservative Party's response.  Is it anything other than a partisan appeal to elements in its base given that it does nothing to promote progress in the toxic Isreali-Palestani standoff and simply encourages the current Israel Government to believe it has useful support for its excessively hard-line and dangerous policies?	0

I think that EVEN WHEN THEY ARE WORN BY CHOICE, which, by the way, it seems they often are when they're worn in Quebec, if you bother to read the actual interviews with the actual people who actually wear them.  Which doesn't mean it's my or the government's place to ban them outright.  And you know what? If a woman is in fact being forced to wear a burqa, and the government turns around and forces her OUT of that burqa, but does absolutely nothing to address whoever or whatever was forcing her before, SHE IS NOT GETTING ANY MORE AGENCY. She's just being pushed around twice over and very possibly put into an untenable situation. Big help.  Furthermore,  that this ""uncover your face"" nonsense isn't about feminism.

I more than often agree with your comments, but not in this case.  While you and Willard could be correct, no evidence has been presented that Bracco or Osborn bullied anyone.  No evidence has been presented that they were running CHS outside (negatively) of the accepted norm.  The only evidence that has been presented is that Bracco sent texts from somewhere other than the Pleasant Hill gym to Osborn inquiring about two students which both had past histories with.  In typical and very current American social standards, Osborn responded back to Bracco with negative and unflattering comments about the two girls.  Regardless of how anyone wants to spin it, that was a private conversation.  If they (mostly Osborn) would have wanted those around them to know what was being written, they would have said it via voice for all to hear.  They were taking what they thought were appropriate steps to keep their conversation private.  I am saddened to know you support the mob on this issue.	0

I feel it would be wise to sell your home fast and move if it becomes law!!   Here is why; Alaska gets 90% of it's money from oil and gas and the Trans Alaska Pipeline is about to be shut down if we don't survive Saudi's attack to stop Alaska and others from producing oil.   Billions of barrels have been found because of these credits and if they are produced and the state will make over a 100 times its investment and Alaskans will have a bright future with lots of money and high paying jobs!!!   Look at oil prices and think ahead, don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs!!!!	0

Just look at the PR pickle that TD bank is in right now and you can understand why Louise has a problem. I would advise anyone to stay away from getting their financial advice from a bank in Canada. Louise should have been doubled her money in 10 years and an effective money manager can do that in 5 years. Buy bank stocks but don't take their financial advice. It's bordering on criminal what Canada's tier 1 banks are allowed to do.  Look at buying US stocks. Visa and MasterCard, for example. They're reliable growth stocks.	0

The Reformation marked the beginning of the end of the stranglehold of organized religion on politics and intellectual thought in the West. It marked the start of a transformation that would eventually lead to the Enlightenment as well as to the 20th century concept of modern secular democracy, with which we are familiar today. The notion that individuals can think for themselves without having their ideas and ideals governed by religious ideology and superstition was revolutionary several centuries ago and is perhaps singularly the greatest contribution to human development to come out of the West. It is worth preserving, promoting and cherishing, for the sake of mankind.	0

China? You must be joking.  Until their adoption of capitalism and their miraculous economic turn around, about  the only thing as predictable as the yearly floods in the Yangtze were the regular famines throughout the country.

Though I'm not impressed with Trump, I think it's important not to play into the polarization that enshrouds current popular political dialogue; the kind of partisan characterizations being used to manipulate public opinion rather than inform it.  Two things are becoming increasingly clear about our next president:  He's as surprised by his victory as we are---And he's going to have one hell of a learning curve if he wants to set his ego aside and actually be president.  We could certainly make things worse by backing him into a radical right corner, and engaging in the popular sport of partisan character assassination---I just don't see how that helps.  Not doing so doesn't lessen our diligence regarding our rights, due process, checks and balances, and the other things that have gone horribly wrong with our government of the people, regardless of Trump:  We don't have to sell copy while we wait to see what the new rules of engagement are.  But we do need to be vigilant.	0

"The elephant in the room here is the anti-Semitism on the Left, a topic everybody is politely stepping around. Anti-Semitic Blacks have murdered more Jews in the United States since the 1980s than white supremacists have. Fact check that claim. The one thing everybody in Charlottesville, left and right, certainly could have agreed on is ""Jews will not replace us."" I am an Orthodox Jew and do not say that facetiously. In fact, thank G-d, white supremacists have been relegated to the dust heap for all practical purposes since the 1970s. Much more currently prevalent and dangerous is the anti-Semitism of the Left, buttressed by the most mainstream of universities, academics and Liberal business leaders. It is now dangerous to be openly Jewish on many U.S. college campuses. (https://www.algemeiner.com/the-40-worst-colleges-for-jewish-students-2016/) Israel is routinely demonized.

I have been a blue collar worker all of my life working for wages & being paid by the hour. I do not own a business & have no political power. I disagree with an income tax of any kind no matter what fancy words are used to try & disguise it by calling it another name. I disagree with it on the principals of private property rights, individual liberty & freedom. I feel the budget should be cut more, across the board. After that was done sufficiently, I would support a flat sales tax where all citizens would be involved in paying the bills of state. This would lead to more frugal government when all citizens had to pay the bills & had something to lose. Politicians could not buy votes by promising to redistribute other people’s wealth with government benefits that the other guy has to pay for.

It made them frugal, and happy with little, which made it easier to save from even meager salaries. I came from a single mother family, and I do know that if you clean up your debts, live on a budget, and only buy what's necessary, you can put that money away.I have a Master's degree and never borrowed for college, even with a wife and a baby. And building that habit into your lifestyle will mean you're still putting away money later.  I packed my lunch today with leftovers, as I've done for 40+ years.  I eat from Tupperware, but I have a retirement account and a nice home.  Wonder if there's a connection there...	0

"The Right is about personal responsibility. We don't support ""single, poor parental teenagers"" because they made a bad decision in life and they should bear the consequences. If their parents didn't teach them about sex, then their parents can help support their teenager's children.

Society shouldn't be made to pay for the poor choices of individuals, and society should not be teaching values to individuals-that is the family domain."	0

"Adams County didn't charge him - this is a 1st degree felony matter, the People of the State of Colorado charged him, and they charged him accordingly. What he is purported to have done, while however sickening and depraved it is, is the exact opposite of committing a hate crime. A hate crime requires that the bad actor, while operating out of a real or perceived hatred for an individual or for a class of people, and where the hatred is based on the victim's ""race, color, religion, or natural origin,"" causes or attempts to cause extreme fear, great bodily harm, or death upon another. This guy went in to a store and just started shooting at everybody - he injured men, women and children from very different races, colors, etc... Because of his wanton and willful disregard for whom he killed, he's now qualified himself for the death penalty - which is a tad bit more serious than the few extra years he'd get for the hate-crimes."	0

O&M will imply taxes going forward and overall project feasibility. There are commissioning/startup costs and some small O&M gets into the capital expenditure budget, but shouldn't be that huge. Here's the part nobody is facing: look at above spreadsheets. On-going long term debt service is $400-500+ million per year. Add $200 million per year (hopefully conservative) estimated O&M. That's $600-700 million per year. Fare recovery is questionable. Even at 50% recovery, that's $300+ million per year unfunded liability. I'm not exactly sure, but I think our bus operates around 20-30% fare recovery, so the numbers could be much worse. Our GET surcharge now bounces around $300 million per year in these spreadsheets. So the projections are saying make the GET surcharge permanent or find another revenue source. Whoever follows Krookwell is going to be coming back for more. And this isn't even on the table now because Krookwell isn't releasing the full spreadsheets he has. Nuts.	0

They instituted the federal per diem scam back when their salaries were about $20,000, and their effort to raise it was rebuffed by the citizens.  Then along came they salary commission, which raised their salaries to $50,400, but unwisely left the per diem question up to the legislature.  They decided to keep the tax- free dough rolling in.

"You are incorrect. The only trial that took place was in Ms. Robinson's defamation case against Mr. Furlong (which was not concerned with the veracity of the allegations in her article, but rather with whether Mr. Furlong had established a defence to justify his statements about Ms. Robinson and her article) (see Robinson v. Furlong, 2015 BCSC 1690).  Two civil cases - unrelated to the allegations in Ms. Robinson's article - were brought against Mr. Furlong, neither of which went to trial (see Morice v.

Considering it was the military & first responders that protected your right to protest and prosecuted hate crimes, we are just going to have to agree to disagree.  I'm sure we agree though, Not all decisive force is at the point of a gun. This IS America. Sometimes it's with a Judge's signature on a court order dismissing an injunction request. Or a Board of Health resolution after FOUR public meetings on the subject.  Or a vote of Congress.  Or a liberal initiative that passed at the ballot.  That's decisive force too.	0

"It has been a frequent occurrence in Alaska that cases of predation on children are hushed up under the guise of ""protecting the victims from further trauma"".  This is nonsense.  Yes, investigations can be traumatizing, esp if poorly handled, BUT it is far more damaging when society hushes up and there is no recognition that a truly grievous wrong has been done to someone, and that the person who did it is Not deserving of sympathy or support.  It is very healing for any one so injured to see that society at large recognizes the heinous nature of the crime committed and is determined to them and other children from those who commit such crimes. There is training for investigators that can greatly reduce the trauma that may be caused by obtaining the details and securing the evidence of such crimes."	0

You don’t need to be a person of faith to believe that children, and all people, deserve access to health care.  You do need to be a morally bankrupt monster to believe that some deserve it more than others.  Free market solutions to healthcare necessarily leave major sections of the population sick, impoverished, and dead.  The ethical opposition to universal healthcare is nonexistent.  If you are worried about how it will be paid for, your god is mammon.  If you are worried about how it will affect your standard of living, your god is yourself. A socioeconomic system of resource distribution which incentivizes accumulation via exploitation will never serve humanity in a meaningful way.  It is time to re-think our place among our fellow humans.  We have the power to take care of one another, take control of our own lives, and take power from the hands of oligarchs and the career politicians they own.  Stand up for yourselves and your fellow humans.  Demand universal healthcare now.	0

"Addendum: The Pope did not reference Isiah and "" the suffering servant"" which many scriptural folks can connect to Christ. In time sense ing gerunds are ongoing present tense. He also referenced Luke. Time was there was a thought that not only was Luke a physician- Taylor Caldwell had a great novel about him- but he was long lived and a friend to Mary. In fact, I was taught Mary was his primary source for his gospel. Even if not grounded in fact- stories like this play an important role. Think of Mary's role at the wedding in Cana. My guess is Mary would have been one of the women who the Depression era hobos would have marked.

"The, ongoing, collective, failure of Blacks, in America, to achieve economic equity, with Whites,  can be traced to certain characteristics that are inherent to that race. First, it in a fact of life, that blacks, on average, have significantly, lower IQs than Whites. Then the problems associated with  low average IQ of Blacks, is compounded by their collective  tendency to drop out of school early, & to be disruptive to the learning environment, while in school.  Then add to this, the common use of foul language, & their manner of dress, with their pants down below their butts, & their tendency towards violent crime Blacks, by their behavior & poor attitudes, are the cause of their, generally low level of achievement in America.   Thomas Jefferson, once said words to the effect, that, ""While it is certain that the slaves would, one day, be free, it is equally certain that Blacks & Whites could not live together, under the same government.""

Thank you for your comment Paul.  I disagree with you.  The story says the wife was in the car during the pick-up.  She was complicit.  She did not tell the police over seven years.  I don't care how much some would like to say he controlled her or prevented her from telling police.  I believe she had a responsibility to tell authorities.  In this kind of situation, fear is not a viable excuse.  Not over seven years.  The only out I can find for her would be if she was confined under restraint for the whole time.  The story, responsibly written, would have noted that the wife was also held prisoner.  There is no bias here, just an expression of principle.  Fear does not excuse one from going along with a heinous crime.  In the end, each of us has personal responsibility.  The wife had a responsibility.  Moreover, the grant of immunity skewed the facts regarding the case.  The wife would not get immunity unless she blamed it all on the husband.   No truth when facts are paid for.	0

1 Because of WHEN they are doing it.   There are doing it at a time where they are supposed to be showing respect to the country.  Why is this  so hard to understand?  Does not holding a BLM protest during an opera, show that you do not care about the opera, its fans, and the producers? 2.  Yes.  If the average Hillary voter does not want to be considered with the AntiFa, why are they not protesting them more?  Why are they not distancing themselves from them? 3.  Yes, they are intruding on a time that they are supposed to be showing respect to the country.   I maybe hung up on the symbolism, but I think it is necessary.  If you can  not even pretend to have the respect for this country that it is due, than you do not belong here.   If you can not understand this, maybe you do not belong here either.

Sorry for the delayed response but, yea, not exactly what I said.   My whole point is that I fully expect my religious convictions (specifically, Jesus Christ is true God and true man) to be OVERWHELMINGLY REJECTED by most people in the world. My expectation is born out of Christ's own admonitions and the testimony of the Church's efforts throughout history.  Simply put, there is no Biblical or historical grounding for Christians to expect a general rapprochement with the world through dialogue over time. This is of course predicated on the idea that the Christian would at some point propose Jesus of Nazareth as true God and true man, actually crucified, bodily resurrected, bodily ascended into heaven, to come again to judge the living and the dead.  You know, the Creed and stuff.	0

If you want your children have beautiful football stadiums, pitch in more for your child to sponsor this activity. Don't make other residents pay for it.

I wouldn't assume that it's just the right wing that is frustrated with Trudeau.

"Raising the minimum wage has forced people like me to work under the table in order to attain employment, as we are stripped of our right to negotiate our own wages for work we render. Then when we do find employment we cannot find affordable housing so that we can support ourselves in independence and dignity because Oregon liberal democrats outlawed affordable housing, and then further price us out of a home through insane property taxes. We used to be able to buy a starter home earning the federal minimum wage. This is the difference between a ""tiny house"" and starter home. The tiny house our government will only allow now is built by a program, and this chains us to a dependence on subsidized housing where no one gets ahead. The starter home can be purchased, the mortgage cuts our rent in half so we do not need subsidized housing, and in what we save in rent we do not need food stamps either. We can support ourselves in independence and dignity."	0

Money will be taken from ordinary people in Ontario struggling to make ends meet and given to carbon traders in California for emission allowances, many of whom got the allowances for free as a result of political lobbying and political donations to the Democratic party.  Meanwhile Ontario government is in the process of giving away free emission allowances to the well connected industries and awarding lucrative contracts to its green crony companies which will be expected to make political donations to the Liberal party and be required to buy tickets to Liberal fundraisers. Both in California and in Ontario, cap and trade is a political fundraising scheme pretending to be a planet saving plan. In reality it is a political party saving plan for the California Democrats and the Ontario Liberals. Anyone who claims that Ontario cap and trade will result in a measurable impact on climate, weather or temperature is either deluded or dishonest or a Liberal party fundraiser.	0

Odd comment from someone with your experience. In over 30 years of working directly and indirectly with addicts, I saw no correlation between faith and sobriety. Those with good support systems (often family) and resources (money/access to services) did somewhat better, but even the most fortunate addicts were too often unable to overcome their addictions.  If you actually worked in the field, I'm sure you observed that the vast majority of addicts are Christians - just like the general public - but they don't have higher recovery rates. Anecdotal evidence supports incorporating spirituality into recovery, but it's nuanced. To some, spirituality does not include a god.  Others may feel more comfortable when treatment resembles their faith - whatever it is.  No reliable comparison data exists, primarily because programs present their data in a way most likely to get customers or support their perspective (http://www.recovery.org/topics/find-a-top-spiritual-and-faith-based-rehab-center/)	0
Do you really put Cousins in that list?   While he has shown signs that he can be a starter, he is far from a proven good QB. He just happened to hit the market as a FA when QBs were sparse. This resulted in high pay but very little to deserve it. I see Cousins as I see Brock Osweiller. Except Brock didn't have as good of an initial showing as Cousins.  Bradford is good but not great.  Brees is legitimately great. He is consistently a top 5 QB every year, regardless of his supporting cast. The main problem with Brees is that he is getting older and I don't know if he will have a career after his contract with the Saints end. He might be finished next year.  Injuries and age are starting to take their toll on Brees and I see him retiring as a Saint or taking a pay cut for one more year and a retirement thereafter.	0

Avoid the Euro fighters so NAFTA won't be a concern. Buy more F-18s (total < 65)  and channel more business to Bombardier.  This plan is the best for Canada and ironically the best for the CF as F-35 would eat up it's capital and O&M budgets. It's not the best for the air force as it wants an in for jobs in USAF HQ and with Lockheed but the good of the many outweighs the good of a hundred or so fighter pilots.

I think sex within marriage carries as much or little as weight as the couple decide it should.  But if, God forbid, my penis were cut off, there would be no less love in my marriage, nor would my marriage be in jeopardy.  I think because of modern perspectives in sex (thanks to Kinsey the quack, et al.), too many people over-emphasize the importance of sex in life.  The Catholic Church has understood that sex, while undeniably a strong drive, can be controlled (hence the expected chastity of priests) and does no have to play an important role, or any role except for reproduction, in marriage.  Indeed, many people live happily in sexless marriages, particularly those who have matured beyond their sexual peaks.  Ironically, the sexual liberation movement that arose simultaneously with the feminist movement has been a windfall for men, making their lustful demands for sex almost a requirement for women to comply with.  My college-age daughter told me sex is a prerequisite to dating!	1

"The government should FORCE companies to identify on their labels where ON EARTH the contents are coming from.  Go to your local grocery store nowadays and check out the cartons of orange juice and pineapple juice. You will find that only about ten percent of the brands identify clearly on the label that it is a product of Florida or California or Brazil.  The remaining 90 percent will have some idiotic label like ""manufactured for Montreal Brand Juice Company"" or ""produced for the  Toronto Brand Juice Company"".  Hello?  Look, we do not grow oranges or pineapples in Canada, so the fruit has to come from somewhere.  And I for one want to be warned if the fruit came from mainland China downstream of toxic coal-powered factories and cadmium-laced heavy metal mines.   if should be illegal for companies to fail to declare where the contents of their food packages came from."	0

"The Ontario Government Brain Trust launched ""Densification"" in the early 2000's, with little guidelines and forethought it is now completely out of control. The mantra is build, build, build.

""Densification""  is turning lots of inner city green space that is necessary for a healthy community to enjoy the outdoors into concrete jungles.

A raid by government forces in Bahrain against a pro-opposition stronghold has left at least five people dead and hundreds detained in one of the deadliest crackdowns since protests erupted in 2011 against the Persian Gulf nation’s Western-backed monarchy.  The timing of the raid was striking, coming two days after President Trump publicly assured the king of Bahrain that their relationship would be free of the kind of “strain” that had occurred in the past — an apparent reference to the Obama administration’s periodic chiding of Bahrain over its human rights violations.	0

Correction to my previous post.  It was not an Executive Order that authorized the Speaker of the House the use of military aircraft to travel to and from home.  It simply was an offer made my President Bush based on security concerns immediately after 9/11.  The practice continued when Pelosi became Speaker, but not for security reasons.  It was done as a courtesy in recognition of her position as Speaker of the House.    There is no directive or law that requires the Speaker to use military transport.	0

There was ABSOLUTELY no reason for this officer to arrest the nurse, let alone, ""rough her up"".  The blood sample wasn't going anywhere.    Several people have asked, ""When can you fight back?""

It should be noted that Amazon already has a significant presence in both the Toronto and Vancouver areas with both offices and fulfillment centres (distribution). Something like 700,000 sq ft. in metro Vancouver and 2 million sq ft. in greater TO. Amazon reportedly  just signed a lease for 150,000 sq. ft of office space in a future downtown Vancouver office tower - doubling it's current space.   That said, I think an east coast office makes some sense - so if they pick Canada - most likely TO. However, there are many desirable US metros who would be willing to put together some attractive packages to snag this potential HQ2 (as Amazon calls it). Although, I think Amazon might also be hedging against US immigration policy uncertainty - in which case Canada makes even more sense. Amazon is already using Vancouver and TO as North American entry points for foreign workers - it seems.	0

With the National Post, we have a political news source just like Fox News in the US but the Americans don't have any totally non-political news source.

Hello Paul. I must agree with part of what you said, in fact a large part of our nations citizens do in fact have very narrow vision when it comes to their parties chosen candidate. We see right here how words, being said by someone not in the chosen party are considered worse then actions committed by leaders of the chosen party. Having a discussion is for the most part a waste of time. I am not happy with myself getting drawn into a sidebar yesterday with Eric. My original point was never addressed, so many extreme partisans most just don't see or acknowledge they are not the smartest person in the room. The arrogance has gone beyond boring and I see myself stepping away from this site again.  I will vote for DT not because I like him but because I am so tired of the lies and the expectations of the parties leaders. They expect to be voted for by loyal subjects without question. I will no longer be used, the left still wants to be. DT is an outsider, we do need a change.	0

These liberal, secular, progressive atheist Democratic party will never accept President Trump as our country leader because of their sour grapes hate.     President Trump has accomplished a lot of things for this country in his first 100 days. For American  jobs, and keeping company from heading out of the country...for American is what this President has done.  A commercial  ad for television was produced about President Trump accomplishment, but CNN (fake news), liberal networks ABC, NBC CBS will not show it.      President Trump is for Christian values, where as Obama was not.  Maybe thats one reason the atheist secular Democratic party will not accept President Trump Agenda."	0
Mr. Rieger makes a compelling case.  The more skin citizens have in the game, the more they pay attention (and vote).  The same argument can be made for taxes, especially income taxes.

Fujio Matsuda, For your information, the rail contingency fund of $643 million has been completely spent.  That was part of rail's $5.2 billion original budget, which has been exceeded by several billion dollars.  Mismanagement is obvious, but no corrective action has been taken.  Without any assurance that rail would control costs, it would be irresponsible to continue to fund rail by bonds or any other means.  You claim that the Attorney General should have taken action if rail had violated the law.  In our democratic system of government, however, all citizens have access to the court system.

A lot of handwringing going on here.  In all the discussions about what the consequences are going to be, the real purpose of the law is lost.  If Saudi government officials did sponsor terrorists, they should be held accountable even if it upsets them.  Maybe sponsors of terrorism withdrawing from our economy isn't such a bad thing in the long run.  If we weren't so tied economically with a country that sponsors terrorism, maybe we would be more apt to hold them accountable in ways other than suing them.  Also, Obama arguing that this is a bad idea smacks of all kinds of hypocrisy given his stance on suing gun manufacturers domestically. He  has no problem hurting American companies to further an anti-gun agenda but suddenly claims pragmatism when it comes to possible sponsors of terrorism.  No one's buying it.	0
"These assumptions seem to have some big holes.  Clinton's economic policies seek to pick up in large part where Obama is leaving off, and he created over 10M (that's MILLION) jobs - about 10x as many as his predecessor.

Clinton also has presented plans on how to support small businesses through both increased access to financing and simplifying regulatory processes.  So while we don't know exactly what will happen in terms of future job markets, this assumption of a shrinking market doesn't have much by way of facts to support it."	0

"It's interesting you should phrase it that way. I was just noticing the other day, while listening to the radio in the car, that country music has developed a bit of a mean streak in recent years. The older guys (George Strait, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks) would write songs celebrating rural life. But the new crowd (Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Eric Church) seem to be promoting songs that say, ""If you're not a gun-owning, American-driving, huntin', fishin', just-like-me redneck, you aren't a real American or a real man."" Maybe I'm just noticing it more as I'm getting older, maybe it's always been there, but it concerns me. A young farmhand listening to the radio is going to pick up on this message, probably without realizing it, and start to think that way too. ""Those stupid, lazy city slickers don't know squat. I'm the real American here."" This has got to be contributing to our current social schism."	0

There will be a homeowner outcry when they get their inflated property tax bill at the end of January.

"When I grew up in Detroit maple syrup was one of my favourite foods. My parents were from Quebec and whenever we took a trip ""home"", we always brought some of the golden elixir back to Detroit.  I pitied my poor friends who used Aunt Jemima on their pancakes and did not know that there was such a thing as maple syrup.  Occasionally, we boiled down our maple syrup and drizzled it over a tray of ice to consume ""la tire d'erable"", a heavenly treat.  Now that I live in Canada maple syrup is no longer a treat to be rarely enjoyed but a regular part of our diet."	0

Once the willingness to compromise was shown, the details were pretty obvious. It would have been better to just directly fund all schools, allow all teachers to unionize and raise taxes to cover the additional costs to the public treasury, however the Blaine Amendment is in the way. The funding plan legislated goes around the Amendment, which in a way is too bad, because it is likely unconstitutional and needs to fall. It could, of course, be repealed, but the NEA, rather than the Protestants who adopted it, would object strongly unless private schools were opened to unions. I wonder what the Cardinal would say about such a tradeoff?	0

Soooo, basically you have antidotal examples; correct me if I wrong but would not a contracted EMS service fit under this government control? Thus would it be cheaper? Black Water sir is NOT operated by the government it is in fact s privately held company by Mike Prince Brother of now Sec of Education Devoss. As a customer of Alaska waste I can assure you it is not cheaper, case in point they charge for recycling. No lowest bidder is not always bad, but it is not always good and when you are talking about the health and safety of our citizens I would say it matters. AFD in one of the top perhaps top two agencies in the nation for cardiac care and saves; you would dismantle that to what save money? I don't recall any private agency being named in a discussion of the top of any facet of EMS.

"Sounds good, Rovenbird, but!

An Order promulgated by FDR and implemented in California by Governor Warren, later to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and responsible for Brown v Board of Education One Man One Vote, Miranda v Arizona,   Which is why judging an historical figure one one period or episode in their life (Deady Hall) is a mistake.    Until sainthood becomes more common, denigrating historical figures because decisions made in 1942  or any other previous time period do not meet with our approval today is wrong.

With regards to Encarnacion, two things (and I am not sure why it keeps getting glossed over when it is obvious):  1) It is only in retrospect that the market turned out the way it did.  Absolutely no one predicted that the markets for Bautista and Encarnacion would be so slow.  Therefore, when Encarnacion turned down the Jays best offer (and it turns out, best offer overall), and this was a price that the Jays were not willing to exceed, then why should the Jays wait around?  Encarnacion would have taken 4  years 85 million from someone else if it was offered. 2) They had to move fast on Morales because he was one of the few left-handed bats (switch-hitter) actually available.  The Jays have too many right-handed hitters and they were shut down far too easily because of it.  Imagine the outcry that would have occurred if they lost Encarnacion AND did not acquire a left-handed bat.  They have accomplished the second goal.	0

My information was released about a week ago by the Washington Post, not obsolete. This article is about ambushes and fatal shootings of police. What I was referring to is your assertion that police shootings of suspects, etc. have almost doubled given the subject of the article. If you want to change the subject and address all people who die as a result of contact with police, how many hundreds of thousands of people who have had contact with a police officer are still alive and what is the actual percentage of people among that number that actually died as a result of an officers poor training or mistakes? Do accidents happen? Are some officers poorly trained? Of course accidents happen and a very few officers are poorly trained. Tell me how every single officer in the country is going to be trained to cover every single eventuality? The video? A tragic incident but in no way characterizes the vast majority of police contact with the public.	0

A perfect example is carbon emissions, if they truly are causing the planet to warm, then regulate those emissions out of existence, governments have that power!

Only a self absorbed American would describe the outcome here in terms of victory and winning. As if there is a victory to be had here and the goal is winning.  The same narrow mentality drove Americans to think they could control outcomes in Vietnam too and Iraq of course. Trillions of dollars later....  Get with the programme. Regional powers most importantly Iran and Pakistan are part of a long term solution to bring development, stability and economic growth to Afghanistan because they have a real stake in those outcomes.   They may not be supporting the same people the US does but that is a reality that US policy and this author must confront not dismiss.    A diplomatic dialogue recognizing the hard realities of regional influence is the only solution.   This assumes the author is interested in  making Afghanistan  a stable functional country.  As long as Americans think they are there to win  and ignore the obvious the game is already lost. A very sad analysis.	0

Here you go, from Forbes 7/2016 ...  Economists at the University of Pennsylvania, also using actual pre-ACA individual market data, estimated that the total expected price of individual market coverage (premiums plus out-of-pocket payments) increased by 14% to 28% as a result of the ACA. According to their findings, “the pre-ACA average premium was lower than the lowest silver plan premium.” Penn’s economists also estimated that plans in the individual market before the ACA had similar actuarial value to silver plans, not an average actuarial value that was 10 percentage points less (and 17% less) than assumed by Adler and Ginsburg. Importantly, all of these studies compare gross premiums before and after the ACA without accounting for subsidies that lowered ACA plan premium. God bless you! Have a great weekend!	0

Contrary to popular opinion, Bernier's loss showed the value of the ranked-ballot system.  The CPC wants to be a 'big tent' party, an amalgam of libertarians, Red Tories, social conservatives and moderates.  In a 'first past the post' system one of those groups will have their day; at this convention that would have been the libertarians.  But in a ranked-ballot system, a strong but divisive platform will not win.  This was the undoing of Bernier, the Libertarian, Lemieux, the right-to-lifer, Leitch, the bigot, and even my personal favourite, Chong, the carbon taxer.  If you lead with something that more than 50% dislike you won't win. In 'first past the post', like the US primaries, you risk getting a Donald Trump, who is the preferred choice of the majority of a faction within a political party within a sub-group (those who vote). Strong single-minded visionary leadership is at odds with the ranked ballot, and this may be a disadvantage, but not in a pluralistic, democratic society.	0

March 17, 2017   National  The U.S. Coast Guard will not see the budget cuts the Trump administration planned for the branch after a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers blocked the move. While President Donald Trump continues to push Congress to boost budgets for military branches managed by the Department of Defense, the administration sought to strip $1.3 billion in spending for the Coast Guard. The cut would have been equal to 12 percent of the branch’s budget. The Coast Guard is managed by the Department of Homeland Security. According to Defense News, the service received an “avalanche” of support from lawmakers from both major political parties after a letter signed by 23 senators protested any cuts. Hey!

So, what you're saying, then, is business as usual at the city of Portland.  I know a land owner who has wanted to fix a dilapidated building for years and years.  However, a sign company has a long-term lease on the side of the building where they have a billboard.  If the building owner fixes up the building as is, the city arborist will require them to put trees in front of the billboard, violating the lease.  And if they tear down the building and put something in its place, the city won't let them replace the billboards.  So what happens? The building sits there for decades looking like shit. Thanks, city that works (at not working).	0

Another example of the varied time in life for a light bulb to be turned on to guide a student toward a life path.  Very few 17-18 year olds are ready for higher education, especially setting a career path.  Some know from an early age, but they are in the minority.  Knowledge can come from so many places other than an academic structure.  The absence of effective career counseling from an early age through exposure by knowledgeable mentors is one of the deficiencies of educational systems.  This young woman's path is reflective of the majority of students-people searching for life meaning.	0

This is reasonable guidance to keep expectations in check.  However, there are times I've wondered what's going on when there seems to be a sharp drop-off in the performance of a security when I buy it and then it perks up when I sell it.   It has happened more than once.   I'm fully aware of what's normal and what isn't.     An example would be Paypal, where I sold it, making a bit of profit, and then about two days later there was an announcement about a change to their terms that would bolster profitability.   It zoomed up immediately.   The fact there was a market announcement that triggered the sudden growth is interesting.	0

The subject was gun homicides, which doesn’t include suicides. We are, after all, discussing people inflicting violence on others. Illinois’ gun murder rate of 5.8 per 100,000 population puts them in a tie for 13th highest. Many of the states with higher rates are the least populous states which tend to skew the numbers somewhat. But the original point still stands... they have very strict gun laws, yet they still have an enormous gun murder problem.	0

"Interesting that supporters of ""far right "" parties are always portrayed as ""anti immigrant"" whereas I think it is as likely to be anti globalisation/anti unemployment. Another article in this paper describes the workers in Amiens who are losing their jobs due to Whirlpool moving to Poland and who are now quite likely to vote for Le Pen. Castigating them as racists just fits the stereotype of them being small minded ignorant racists whereas if they had jobs their voting habits would probably be quite different. This current rhetoric that job loss is due to ""automation"" is mostly bull. The ability of corporations to move to low wage countries as with North America and NAFTA is what is causing joblessness and dissatisfaction. The corporate world only has itself to blame."	1

"""Trump approval rating sinks to new low President Trump's approval rating has fallen to 37 percent -- the lowest of his fledgling presidency, according to Gallup. His disapproval rating rose correspondingly, hitting 58 percent, ABC's ERIN DOOLEY notes.

The offended tend to argue about speech as though it is all functionally and legally identical.  Using a university's internal resources, e.g. a web site, to express a viewpoint is not the same as expressing that view in a loud voice on the sidewalk or in a milder voice in the classroom.  Context matters.    Using the N-word in a class discussion of Huckleberry Finn is essential. It is impossible to excise one scene, in which a white woman expresses her pleasure that no one was hurt because only a negro was killed, and still teach Twain in a meaningful way, because the specific words are crucial to his way of pointing out hypocrisy. Using the same word out on the street in the face of a black person has no such purpose.   Most universities are run by the fearful today, and college leaders are unwilling to move slowly and carefully in responding to speech problems case-by-case in the face of political noise.  They instantly go to SweatCon 4 and flail about.  The result is usually bad.	0

Pretty much every government in the developed world had the same thing whether they were left wing or right wing.  For starters any government that went through the great recession would like bad.  The other reason is we have an aging population with more leaving the work force than entering so slower economic growth is the new norm no matter whom we elect.  Japan today is a perfect example of what happens with an aging population as they have the highest median age and have had only 1% growth on average since 1998.  The only benefit we have over Japan is we have immigration to help counter this trend which they don't.	0

As alcohol prohibition did,idiotic drugs prohibition creates huge black market profits making criminal gangs more rich,powerful,&ultra-violent.Drugs prohibition's failing even more miserably than booze prohibition did.The longer we've had ill-conceived prohibition,the worse have societal problems created by it gotten,including property crime by addicts paying artificially inflated black mkt prices.  Illicit opioids R today more risky than prohibition era booze(when there was risk of amateur distillers ending up w.deadly methyl alc,).If opioids were legal&more carefully regulated than we regulate deadly tobacco&alcohol,there'd be far fewer users dying of ODs. People are dying in droves now 'cause of prohibition laws which deny users legal access to regulated drugs of known purity&strength in standardized doses. Instead, prohibition forces users to buy from criminals and play black-market-drugs-roulette. Prohibition kills. End the unjust, hypocritical, counter-productive war  on drugs.	0

This is a well balanced article that takes many issues into consideration.  My concern still has to do with taking rentals away from local people.  Even with allowing only owner occupied homes to rent rooms to tourists, if that is necessary to maintain their homes, they are probably in over their heads.  Renting a room to locals is also pretty lucrative and should be able to make up a reasonable shortfall in living expenses.  The nicer the home, the higher the rent, has always been in play.  But when you can charge outrageous fees to tourists, the playing field is no longer level or reasonable for a local to rent the same room.	0
"When does your question stop and your assumptions begin again? Why does the 2nd Amendment allow Military-grade assault weapons to be sold to anyone who isn't a Muslim or a known criminal?

They don't have the TYPES of weapons that are peddled to 2nd-Amendment loving Yankees, mind you. But they CHOOSE NOT TO use them on each other like the Fear-Instilled USA.

I am an employee who's been working at TCF for 14 years, my brother for 17 years and my father was the one mentioned who retired after 42 years. I would like to correct a couple of things.

"And actually, to follow up on my question (does anyone remember ANY such opinion about comparable Canadian matters making it past an editor)...  ... well, ask yourself a second question, was the Canadian article in question sitting beneath a paraphrased version of today's actual headline, as in:   ""Will Liberal Party take long to make Canada less white?""  If that headline above an opinion piece makes you bristle, if that headline seems glaringly offensive, if you are feeling outrage against the words you see in print...  ... then ask yourself a third question:  When it comes to opinion pieces, why is the Canadian media so comfortable hurling provocative and pungent spit-balls and molotov cocktails on issues of immigration and race IN AMERICA to provoke stark, uninhibited discussions about race and immigration matters in AMERICA...  ... but not comfortable using the same approach with immigration and race matters in Canada?

I was getting a haircut a couple of weeks ago, and my barber mentioned that he had no Rx insurance and had to buy a very expensive script. Fortunately, he shopped around and found the locally owned pharmacy charged about a quarter what Fred Myers charged. So I went and checked on an Rx that I get, and I have insurance. Freddie's wanted $146 but a local Bi-Mart wanted $70. I've got great coverage, but it will be a cold day in hell before I go back to Freddie's again to fill my script. My plan doesn't need to pay all that extra. I think we should all spend our plan's money as if it were our own. The hell with the price gougers.	0

Actually I do. A gas powered car will cost you about 6 cents per mile to maintain whereas an EV will cost about 3 or 4 cents per mile. And you don't have to be wealthy to own an electric car. The Nissan Leaf, The Chevrolet Bolt just to name two are quite reasonable in price. Many a regular powered ICE vehicle cost every bit as much.   An all-electric 2017 Ford Focus comes with a base price of $32,000  while the  the gas-powered “titanium” version, which shares similar features, costs $27,000. Your fuel bill for an electric car will be about 1/3 of a gas powered car.  And those prices keep getting cheaper as mass production takes affect. Maybe it's you that has no clue after all.	0
Yes and the majority of Ontarians supported the provinces green power initiatives until the costs became clear.  I wonder if the outcome of the poll would have been different if there were questions like:  How much of the world's carbon emissions does Canada contribute? How much do China and India contribute? Would you support a carbon tax if it cost you personally $300, $500, $1000 per person per year (up to $4000 for a family of 4 per year)? Did you know that if we moved to a zero output in this country that it would make virtually no difference in world greenhouse gas emissions and would not stop global warming?  Then ask the question on the poll.  Bet the answer would have been significantly different.  I make this argument because in casual conversations with friends, family, co-workers etc. very few know the answers to any of the above questions.  So, one wonders then how they can approve or disapprove of justins climate agenda when they don't have all the facts.	0

Indeed. Thanks for pointing that out. Clearly my calculator needs a bigger window and possibly some new batteries. I will sub out the math in future.

"Well just war thinking involves criteria and principles, in fact a set of tests.  The first one is often referred to as ""authority""  ""What is your authority"" to act, on the basis of what legal institution or structure are you acting on behalf?  The military doesn't just on its own act, it relies on orders tied back to a non-military authority, e.g. the president. The president generally needs Congress to act.  The UN could also be considered an authority..e.g., acting on behalf of UN Resolutions, or even violated UN resolutions.  - Authority is one principle - Last resort is another principle; peaceful means tried but failed? - Intention is another principle..what are you trying to achieve...e.g., restore legitimate authority, remove tyrannical authority, etc.   Or are you trying to ""get well"" by invading and plundering another country.

Australia for whatever reason seems like quite a racist country despite being founded on immigration like Canada.  While there are more immigrants in Australia than Canada, the country is still more white than Canada as up until 1973 if you were white you had the automatic right to settle in Australia and that was only changed in 1973.  There doesn't seem to be a strong anti-immigrant undercurrent amongst white working class here as well as we don't have any parties to the right of the Conservatives they have to worry about and Liberals don't rely on white working class votes anyway, but do heavily on immigrant community and likewise Tories need to do better in the immigrant community to win, so in sum won't be happening here and thank heavens for that.	0

U.S. News and World Report February 2013:  Of the more than 300 American deaths from political violence and mass shootings since 9/11, only 33 have come at the hands of Muslim-Americans, according to the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security. The Muslim-American suspects or perpetrators in these or other attempted attacks fit no demographic profile—only 51 of more than 200 are of Arabic ethnicity. In 2012, all but one of the nine Muslim-American terrorism plots uncovered were halted in early stages. That one, an attempted bombing of a Social Security office in Arizona, caused no casualties.	0

"The Scriptures tell us that His/Their name is Yahweh Yahweh Elohim.  Exodus 33:19 – “And He said, I will cause all My goodness to pass before your face.  And I will call out the name of Yahweh  before your face ...”   Exodus 34:6 – “And Yahweh passed by before his face and called out:  Yahweh Yahweh Elohim.”  Deuteronomy 6:4 – “Hear, O Israel, Yahweh our Elohim is Yahweh echad.”  The word “echad” is plural, signifying more than one Yahweh.  Had only one Yahweh been meant, the word would have been “yachid” which is singular. The first Yahweh is the Father, Yah Yahweh, whom we pray to as our Father, who art in heaven.  The second Yahweh is the Son, Yahshua Yahweh, also known as Yahshua Mashiyach, or Yahshua (Yah is salvation) the anointed/Jesus the Christ.  Elohim (Gods) is a uniplural noun (collective nouns are similar) which signifies unity in oneness.  This concept is the Jews ""stone which causes offense"".

What do you mean your vote would have no effect on the outcome? It would be added to the vote totals from all the other states and affect the outcome.

"We are about to see a long-standing premise either be proven or refuted. That premise is that putting nothing but businessmen in the highest positions will allow the government to be run like a business. Presumably this means better decisions and better use of money.   Whether you agree or disagree with this premise, or whether government can or should be run like a business, we are about to see it tested. That will be interesting in its own right.   The problem, of course, will be to decide what ""better"" means.   More services and benefits for less taxes?  Hard to argue with that.   Less taxes and less services/benefits? That's very arguable.   One metric that will always work is to judge how the national debt changed from entering office to leaving office. It's a dollar amount and it's not arguable. It clearly doesn't tell the whole story, but it's an important one. I'll be watching that one come the next election."	0

"Mr. Singh projects more flare and charisma than the other drab NDP candidates and probably has our dear Leader aka Little Lord Fauntleroy seething with jealousy.

However that ship has long sailed-as we are now beholden to the ill conceived ""30 year work in progress"" social policy called ""multiculturalism"" and the ""Charters of Rights and Freedom for terrorists and pedophiles"". Both call for the accommodation of all groups and denounces any challenge as ""racist"" or ""discriminatory"" with the added threat of legal action. Overt religious bias in elected government affects our democracy. It also stifles honest debate as politicians do not want to appear to be politically insensitive to ""minority groups"" even when there are blatant problems.

The mature view is that the US, on the one hand, and Mexico and Canada, on the other, benefit from NAFTA and would benefit further from updates reflecting the needs of economies that have evolved over the past 3 decades. Likewise, all would suffer a brutal transition and loss of many long term benefits if NAFTA was terminated.  These will be tough negotiations and may be punctuated by one side or the other suspending negotiations or threatening to terminate NAFTA.  However, there are good reasons to believe that after prolonged negotiations a viable compromise solution will emerge.  The key is for Canada and Mexico to remain steadfast and reasonable and not allow themselves to become overawed or bullied into accepting unreasonable concessions to the US or into foregoing reasonable US concessions as part of the final bargain.	0

While I honestly think that something went on, I tend to believe that Trump knew little if anything of it.  My bet is that his people did collude with the Russians, but that they kept him in the dark.  That would explain his behavior to this point.  He is lashing out, because he feels he has been falsely accused.  Unfortunately, it is probably the most likely scenario.  If for no other reason, I just don't think Trump is smart enough to pull off that type of collusion, and he to date has shown that he has so little impulse control, that he would have let something slip by now.  All that being said, some of what he has done in reaction to this could be seen as obstruction of justice and I could see him still being impeached, not for collusion, but for trying to sway the investigation.  And in the end, wouldn't that be the kicker, he did nothing wrong to begin with, but his reactions to an investigation created an impeachable offense.	0

"But don't forget Chris, while it is hard to pay down the principal on a high interest rate loan, at that time, the principal of the loan would be a lot smaller than it is today for the same home (if all things were equal).  It's a false argument to say that paying off $100k at 17.75% is harder than paying off, for example, $600k at 2.5%. It's not harder, if all things were equal, paying off those loans then and now should be the same ""difficulty"".  It's all about luck, borrowing $100k at 17.75% over 20 or 25 years and then having interest rates go down over the long term is way more attractive than borrowing $600k at 2.5% and then having interest rates rise over the same period.

Until we do, we must limit or stop entry and 'catch up' in my opinion.    https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/19/san-bernardino-shooter-spousal-visa-problems-investigation	0
Trump quote:  “I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”	1

It saddens me that a great number of university-going millennials do not at all value freedom of expression and free exchange of ideas.

"Simple. Once FBI says ""Nothing found"" it implies that the investigation is over and that nothing has been found to warrant any charges. In the other case, since there has been no investigation but could be, the FBI would rather say nothing than make a blanket statement that could come back to bite and embarrass  them if at a later date they do find something worth investigating. I know that sounds a bit stretched but it's a policy most law enforcement agencies follow."	0
Based on 2015 real property tax revenue of $928 million, that's about $4.6 million a year (probably closer to $5 million now). Doesn't seem excessive given the amount of work the zoo needs.

If, if,if. It is questionable that you would exist in your present form had two things not happened. Had abortion not been illegal and frowned upon, and had your father not come home inebriated. On a more serious note, the best decision Israel ever made was to acquire nuclear weapons, thereby putting its sworn enemies on notice that Israel is here to stay and not to fool with her. And as far as full, unwavering backing by the US is concerned, Obama's recent stunt casts doubt on that. However, with the demise of the pantywaist-in-chief and the arrival of a new sheriff, that could easily change.	0

He said Muslims in Canada and I would say in the West in general. He is not alone in asking the question. Some Muslim scholars are asking the same questions. They want the Wests liberalism to protect them against Islamaphobia but see liberalism as the enemy when it comes to LGBT rights, sex education in the classroom, gender equality and a secular state. If it becomes a power struggle, it appears the Trumps, Putins, LePens and other populists leaders yet to emerge will be the victors. A moderate Muslim leadership that revises the religion to the realities of the West and a modern multicultural state is key.	0

The problem has been identified by simple perception and confirmed by an expensive study.  I believe the solution is a functioning jail.  It worked in Springfield.  When someone commits a crime like trespassing or having an open beer on the sidewalk or fighting downtown they get arrested and actually spend time time in the jail.  Second offense=longer sentence.  It only takes a trip or two to the Springfield jail before they realize they need to stop committing those crimes in Springfield.  They come to downtown Eugene where they get worthless tickets or 4 hours in the Lane County Jail and never set foot in Springfield again.  A citation for smoking or having a dog is wortless.  You can't get blood from a turnip, nor money from a transient.	0

When I read stories like this one , which tell us how more and more farm land is being destroyed to make way for large single detached homes to serve a growing population through increased immigration, it is clear that to me that all the yak about climate change by Trudeau, Wynne et al is more about taxing us than meaningful steps to allay environmental concerns.

In the early years of the church, while we do have bishops beginning to be seen, and we have deacons named in Acts, there is little formal leadership indicated in some of these house churches.

Until the Conservatives find both a leader, and cabinet material, and philosophy of the Peter Lougheed/Bill Davis middle of the road pragmatic molds, they are going nowhere.

Are you suggesting we do theology by voting?  Clear majorities (by survey, no less) shall decide the Word of God?    What if the clear minority disagree?  It sounds like you want to divest the center of  its control and authority and vote by Union or perhaps Division in the hope that you could muster a majority and get your way and ordain women to the gospel ministry.    There are two glaring problems: One; the new substantial minority would be firmly opposed to such action and you have left them out of your plan.  Two: Congregational authority and control is the only logical place to devolve power.  If the GC doesn't have authority, Divisions, Unions and local conferences don't either.  What would do with dissenting congregations?  What is the plan?  It is the conservative part of the Adventist church that is growing.  WO won't change that.  To believe the hordes of disaffected Adventist youth will magically return to the pews if the church becomes 'progressive' is fantasy.	0

What do you think about the charter amendment proposal (76A) that would allow HART to issue revenue bonds with approval of city council?  Before you answer, here's a little more information.  It's my understanding that revenue bonds used for public transit are usually backed by fares.  However, this proposal would move O&M from HART, and therefore fare management, to the Department of Transportation Services and a new Rate Commission.  In addition, interest on revenue bonds is usually higher than G.O. bonds, and HART already has the authority to issue those.	0

You will notice I said our daily useage is 40l total. Including shower and all other uses.

My point was that 87 litres is easily achievable, but we are not doing it. People are not listening to the message. Not just some people, but the majority of people. We all need to work harder on reducing consumption and help each other reduce consumption. That is not merely de Lille's job.  With that in mind, thanks for the bucket idea.	0

There was quite a long stretch where it provided some of the worst monitoring-and-response service I'd ever experienced  --  that was the time when the company was focusing on its new fake-warfare training business.  The problem was, if SSNW installs your alarm system, nobody else can monitor it, even if SSNW's monitoring becomes more a security liability than an asset.  But no doubt this time the alarm-system work won't suffer just because SSNW is developing another new business, the fabulous barking-dog phone app. <more snark>"	0

Couldn't finish my comment about ways to handle an unwanted feral cat. You have no idea of how many animals it has killed. All cats are predators, but their first choice would be a lizzard or similar, then a mouse and last a bird since they are difficult to catch and are lazy. People destroy more birds than cats by cutting down trees and  eradicating their homes, birds fly to tall mirrored buildings-so you have been misled, sir. If you have a cause, you don't give up like you suggested.  I have been working on a cat killer case for almost a year and it is going thru the court system as I write. In TX it is illegal to kill a feral, stray, or pet cat, so I hope you don't live there, and in most states it's a crime unless you are threatened or it attacks you. You aren't totally worthless, as you are feeding it, so don't expect it to go away when it's dining on you. Call your local animal control to trap it if it bothers you.Ferals are wild-never was socialized -irresponsible owner.	0

No it doesn't. No state is immune to the predations of wealthy men seeking to further enrich themselves by devouring the public purse. It happens in communist states, it happens in capitalist states - and when endangered, it employs the securocrats to defend itself, in capitalist and communist states alike. It happened in Venuzuela, but it also happened in Pinochet's Chile. It happen in deeply communist china and it happens right now in calls-itself-communist-but-is-really-capitalist China. It happens in autocratic dictatorships but it also happens in democracies if the institutions of that democracy are not strong enough.  In short, power corrupts, and neither the economic nor political system in which power is gained can prevent that.  Furthermore, financial power corrupts just as absolutely as political power does. The rich and powerful are always equally corrupt - and that is always the maximum amount of corruption they can possibly get away with.	0

Trump's firing Comey is hypocritical. He claims he fired Comey over the handling of the Clinton emails, but he didn't fire him and actually praised him. In the dismissal letter, Trump claims Comey said he wasn't being investigated three times. Really? Did that happen? Or did Comey actually say Trump was being   investigated. It's odd that the reasoning for Comey's dismissal came only days after he requested more funds to investigate Russian ties to the Trump campaign.  It's laughable to accuse Senator Schumer of hypocrisy. Schumer actually admired Comey publicly. He did not call for him to resign after the Clinton email incident. He said he'd lost confidence in him. It's a strong rebuke, but falls short of a demand for his job. And Obama did not fire Comey. Neither did Trump.  And how does Trump appoint a new director? Will he stall until the Russian investigation is stalled? Will he pick a loyal Trumpite? It will not look good if he picks someone who can't be seen as impartial.	0

To look at it another way, the American Taxpayer is also funding our health care. Not good, not good at all, my friend. How long does the lefty media here in Toronto think the Americans under President Donny is going to accept this state of affairs?	0

"""empirically hateful""  Empirical = 'by observation rather than by logic or theory' = subjective.  Most modern 'hate speech' is really just speech that someone disagrees with because they don't like the conclusions, and so you cannot separate their own personal dislike for the concepts from 'hate'.  I much prefer the legal standard, where you have to actually be looking to harm or incite harm against a people before it qualifies.  It keeps the waters less muddy and takes the job out of the mob, and puts it where it belongs with the police.  Making empiricism our standard really means that we're handing the keys to public discourse to some pretty thin-skinned people."	0

I've got a better idea. Canada is a far safer and more prosperous location than Israel. So given that the vast majority of Israelis are first or second generation immigrants to the land anyway, why don't we invite them to move to Canada? Canada has tons of room; Israel has none. (That's why they're stealing land from the Palestinians.) The entire region around Israel promises to be a hotbed of armed conflict for decades to come. Plus, we're much closer to Florida.  If Canadians really care we'll open our doors to Israeli settlers. Surely Canada will welcome a people that, in the eyes of some at least, can do no wrong.	0

Agreed, but the NDP and Greens were PR or bust while the Tories figure moving to such system would tear their party apart as they can appeal to 40% by being moderate enough to appeal to swing voters while right wing enough to keep their base happy.

"OK, real world example of what a bad deal the PPN is for investors. Taking BMO's current offering of 16% max over 4 years, they include 15 (good dividend payers) and max out each holding to the 16% market price cap. Assuming you bought this on Jan 1, 2013 and it expired Jan 1, 2017, thirteen of the fifteen had price gains exceeding the 16% max growth, and the other two (POT and TA) would give you zero, since the share price change was negative. This means 13.87% over 4 years, which is 3.30% compounded annually.  Meanwhile, what if the bank took your money and bought each holding. At the end of the four years, they keep all the excess gravy (CTC.A was up 101%!), and using longrundata.com, the total return (including the dividends that you forgo) would have been 57.80%, which works out to 12.08% compounded annually.   On top of this, there is a ""calamity"" clause giving the bank full licence to cancel or reduce any interest payments, which is totally at their discretion. One-sided!"	0

Like DougNorCal, I am a PR consultant who provides clients with the kind of advice that Bennet Group was hired to give HPD. I find their advice offensive. In my experience, it is vital that high profile individuals and groups develop good relationships with the media. In most cases, HPD and reporters share the same goal: giving the pubic an accurate picture of the events being covered. You cannot work toward that end if you have no respect for the people you are dealing with.  Reporters and the public are not stupid. They will figure out when you're trying to snow them. There is no substitute for trust, and it doesn't take many instances of attempted manipulation to erode that trust permanently.    It also bothers me that the public's glimpse of the practice of public relations in this case makes us look like charlatans. I'm proud of my profession. We deserve better examples of our craft.	0

"The Church's current teaching on homosexuality requires same sex attracted men to be celibate. It is therefore understandable that some of them might consider the priesthood or religious life to be an appropriate life choice. The report states that there are many gay priests and religious who live exemplary lives and do not abuse children, and they are the ones who have become psychosexually mature enough to take on celibacy. The report states that the Church's homophobic attitudes does not help this maturing process. Benedict's branding of them as ""inherently disordered"" and as unsuitable to be priests simply because of their sexual orientation only has the effect of driving them further into the closet with all the conflicts that this brings. They are required not just to be celibate, but to live a double life by hiding their orientation. If some estimates of the number of gay priests are correct, your solution would halve their number."	0

According to OSCE there has been no quiet time on the border between Ukraine and its dissident regions. The only thing different is the volume of gunfire , it's type and its destructive power.  For a while it seemed most of the most destructive weapons were parked and laagered  - but distrust meant that OSCE could verify and inspect  relatively few of them. Those it could demonstrated a ready ability, on both sides,  to remove and relocate heavy weapons at will.   So when the volume of firing increased late Fall as government forces began to 'advance slowly' into what they called 'abandoned' areas, it didn't take long until softening-up and harassing shellfire were part of the 'musical arrangement'. The already-destroyed airport at Donetsk is under shellfire again. Even the Christmas tree lighting in Lugansk was harassed with fire.   It has since then just gotten worse.	0

The way to deal with populism is to listen to the people and address their concerns. It is the job of politicians to do this, fashioning policy in a way that we can all grumble about but accept without tearing each other to pieces. Until now Canadian politicians have been deaf, pushing an agenda from both right and left that more and more citizens disagreed with. Now they are being forced to listen. Trudeau seemed to recognize the downside of Globalism in a speech a few days ago. Now Preston Manning is mulling over the issues. Perhaps this will inspire the MSM which until now has done nothing but stick its fingers in its ears. But hard work lies ahead to find a policy we can all live with. That is the job of the politicians. The job of the media is to actually allow the debate. I watched a documentary on Al Jazeera last night - The Big Picture.  It argues that every US president since FDR has represented the corporate agenda rather than the people.  A good theory for how we got here.	0

No, Max, it does NOT seem so, at least unto mine own self.

The defense issue, is non-arguable.  No matter what type of firearm is utilized, an individual should, and is, allowed to defend themselves, their families, and their own neighbours from immediate danger.  Terrorists and killers may utilize certain weapons so as to bring further their own kill or maim count, but should the adult population be armed, said count would be much lower, as those armed citizens would take said terrorist(s) and killer(s) out way beyond what said terrorists or killers wanted to accomplish.

Jimmy Kimmel’s outrage may be sincere, but it is misguided.  The “pre-existing condition” caveat does not apply to children with birth defects, but to those individuals who do not choose to buy healthcare insurance until they themselves are already ill; in other words, those who only jump on the healthcare bandwagon when they have to.  Kimmel is just another celebrity holding forth on social issues without having done his homework, and obviously Doyle is in the same boat.	0

4 cylinder Jaguar F-type was added to the lineup in order to offer more affordable trim level. F-type R with supercharged V8 making 575hp and F-type S with supercharged V6 making 380hp are still offered, however they are $100K+ and $90K+ cars.  Personally, I think it was a mistake to add 'cheap' option to F-type lineup.  Thing is, F-type is a sports car - it has stiff suspension, has small driver's space that enables it deliver amazing power and handling. When delivered with 4 cylinder engine it is just an uncomfortable cruiser.	0

This is a sad day when innocent lives are lost during a police encounter. Its a sad day when our police are targeted and killed because of some very bad decisions by the few. This is getting out of control. Stop this madness. BLM needs to focus also on making blacks lives better not rail against all police. We as a nation know so many crimes are committed by blacks, even blacks on blacks, i.e Chicago? Non blacks are leery of blacks already because of this bad behavior because a large percentage of crimes are committed by them. Personally, I despise the white trash criminal even more. Either way, let justice prevail for officers who make very bad decisions, and yes we need to all come together to understand each other and respect each other. I love a law abiding citizen no matter what color, but will never support a criminal of any color. I feel for the families of the people who were shot, both the civilians and the officers.

Hot money out of Asia (including China) is spreading throughout the Pacific Islands, down under, the west coast of the US, Europe, and everywhere you look. China had a huge US dollar reserve and they are now spending it. I wonder where the Fangs would get their workers, same place that Imperial Pacific International got their contractors and workers? Right now there are several hundred Chinese workers, unpaid, housed in poverty, with no passports, some dead or badly injured on the job, building the IPI Casino in Saipan, a Chinese investment! The EB-5 program is supposed to result in job creation, 10 jobs per $500,000 investment. There are at least 60 Chinese investors, times 10 jobs equals 600 permanent jobs......Where do the Fangs propose that these jobs will be located, groundskeepers and window-washers at the Hawaii City Plaza? In Saipan we are seeing Chinese investors, developers, contractors openly flouting federal law related to historic properties  and labor. Go Ikaika!!!	0

"Did Charles Sousa forget to remind Ontarians that there are also untold BILLION$  in annual costs required to underpin civil servant pensions due in less than 20 years? There is no provision at all in their current budget for long term pensions. That translates into huge tax increases in the future to ALL Ontarians to pay for these civil servant pensions. Pensions that are grossly over-valued and unsustainable to be under-pinned by future generations - absolutely and financially ruinous.   No, of course he wouldn't be that honest, would he?

You addressed the points but it changes none. Regardless, I think we agree with the fact that even properly decided cases can lead to unjust outcomes.  While we may always disagree that anti-abortion is equal to a war on women, I can live with that; no two people will agree on everything.  I'll leave tax policy alone as there are always unintended consequences, but I think we can further agree that all laws are line-drawing exercises - person-hood is one such line.	0

Call obligations are dictated by the size of the practice group.  In a small hospital you might be on call all of the time.  In a medium/large hospital the call frequency would be much less.  Your second question is a bit odd.  If your wife doesn't respond to her pages in a timely manner (I doubt that anyway) then she would be considered negligent.  There's no list of who to call next in any particular order outside of the actual schedule.  Yes, other physicians contact info would be available and they could be called/paged in a haphazard approach.  This would hopefully work out during daylight hours.  In the middle the night it's an even riskier way to conduct medicine.	0

So what are they charging these days for a reverse mortgage? 5%? 6%? Okay you can find some stocks that have a dividend payout of that rate. But ... they aren't risk free. And, I dare say, most people who might be considering a reverse mortgage aren't likely the most financially sophisticated.	0

"It isn't clear the extent to which the US still meddles in Venezuelan politics, but at this point it doesn't even matter. They didn't cause the economic catastrophe that is befalling the country, they are inevitable consequences of longstanding policies. And scapegoating the US boogeyman doesn't create a reasonable justification for Maduro to move the country to effective one-party rule, as he is now doing. The upcoming vote puts basically to the people the question: ""Which Maduro loyalists do you want to be able to unaccountably decide the shape of the Venezuelan government from now on?"" And the result of that vote will be laughably called the will of the people.  This is tragic. The future of 31 million people, already in the midst of economic catastrophe, looks very dim when this is how their leaders are acting."	0

We had Moe Conservative, Larry Liberal, and Curly Joe NDP, going ""Nyuk! Nyuk!"" one to another to another.   Since Trump's election, posters have become unhinged,  the discourse twisted,  attacks on truth and free speech shocking,  political waters muddied, hate appalling.   Liberal, conservative and centrist fascism grows along side the daily barrage of attacks on Trump. Fascists love dragging the most anti-fascist folks down into the fascist slime.

Eugene is full of substandard housing that requires expensive upkeep to maintain decent habitability.  So, that housing is costly, and renters pay.  In addition, a lot of rentals are owned by absent landlords who are impossible to hold accountable, except at public cost.  Why should this be so?  Why should rental housing be substandard yet expensive?  Housing is still a largely unregulated free market.  Low-cost housing can be designed and built to standards aimed at durability, easy repair of basic conveniences, and low initial cost and upkeep.  This is what the city should aim for, rather than wasting money on enforced upkeep of substandard and aging rental structures.	0

I have absolutely NOT defended the Nazis nor the KKK.  It has never happened.  These radical right extremists are also collectivists, enemies of freedom.  The biggest difference is they are very few and have no influence on mainstream society.  This is not true of Leftist extremist, who have a lot of influence and are very rarely called out in the media, which is why we must highlight the efforts they make to destroy society.  Did you watch the video?  They make it very clear they oppose individual choice and any pro-choice person should recoil in horror as they advocate what has proven, over and over, to lead to mass murder through direct, and indirect, action.  Venezuelans are escaping across borders, in all directions, in order to avoid starvation.

Agreed!  Observing ordained women of other denominations (including denominations with apostolic succession), there can be no doubt that God does indeed call women to the priesthood.  Knowing individuals with a same-sex orientation, it's clear that they are not intrinsically disordered.  Being acquainted with people for whom responsible parenthood includes the use of contraceptives gives lie to the teaching that it leads to “marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards.”  When I observe the disconnect between certain Church teachings and what I see, I can't help but recall the old joke about the man who denies he is cheating when his wife finds him in bed with another women.  “Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?”	0

I think you're right; at least, I hope so. The loss of the state tax exemption from the federal income calculation means that state income would be taxed twice. I don't see how that can fly. The R Congressional caucus is fragmented, no Dems will vote for this bill, and McConnell and Ryan think that whatever bill comes out will go through reconciliation and get passed with a simple majority. I'm not certain they will get a majority in either House.  And here all along, I'd hoped and expected that Trump would cut my taxes. What a fool I was!	0
"""Harvard’s George Borjas (himself an immigrant from Cuba) is an immigration myth-buster. He argues that the economic costs and benefits of modern immigration are largely a wash. But the costs and benefits aren’t evenly distributed... [and result] in a tremendous transfer of wealth from the poorest people in the country to the richest.""  Economist and Oxford professor Sir Paul Collier has argued essentially the same things. Wente's conclusion that Canada's immigration approach works better because we choose our immigrants based on qualifications is somewhat misleading. Refugees aren't selected based on qualifications and sponsored relatives, other than the spouses and children of skilled immigrants, often don't easily integrate into the Canadian economy. Further, a recent article in the Economist magazine questioned the effectiveness of our points-based selection system. And Canada has a poor record for retaining skilled immigrants.

Populism is a political movement that supports ordinary people against the establishment elites in government, business, universities and the media. Canada has a long history of very successful populist politicians: Mitch Hepburn, Premier of Ontario; Maurice Duplessis, Premier of Quebec; Camillien Houde, Mayor of Montreal; William Aberhart, Premier of Alberta; and Rob Ford, Mayor of Toronto. Populism is neither right nor left, it is only against establishment elites. Populism is often a reaction against the condescending and patronizing attitude toward ordinary people by the establishment elites such as Globe editors and columnists.	0

The tired narrative that good guys with guns will persevere is warped. The tired reflex of thanking your god-du-jour for the divine intervention of sending a second shooter once the first had exhausted his killing spree is also warped, after the victims, young and old, had perished. The first shooter wasn't even stopped. He was barely slowed down. They were speeding.  What part of anything did you get right in you pathetic attempt to paint gun ownership as the panacea for our social ills and the cure for gun violence?	0

My general statement applies to what I've witnessed as a majority.  It's a case by case thing, though.  Really feel bad for this father.

Saint Cecilia Catholic Community, where I am pastor, meets in a warehouse. The altar is at the front with the clergy seated behind it. We celebrate westbound.

"It is hard to parse ""everything on the Internet must be true"".

So does this mean that only true things are allowed on the web, or that if it is on the web, it is true?   I know, I know... satire. Still, in this Orwellian Age it is worth pondering."	0

Archie Belaney's books were valuable and the life he led in Canada's north was edifying.   Canada benefited from both.

I'd like to see an independent appraisal of the value of this blighted property. It smells to me like the City bailing out a property owner. The Post might want to investigate who the owners are and what are their connections to the Mayor and City Councilors. And I'd keep an eye out for a deal where the City spends millions to buy the property, level the building and they sells it for $1 to a developer. Bottom line - Denver is a booming city - why is it dabbling in real estate? This isn't Detroit where the city has to buy up vacant property. Unless the owner is asking for far too much (and in this case I believe that to be true) a private developer should be looking to buy this lot. Whenever we see a government entity bailing out a property owner we should look for corruption.	0

How much more political tension and upheaval do you want?   If you assess property taxes on churches, you then have to let them be able to protest their taxes every year. How do you tax churches, by number in each denomination or by size/amenity of each church?   OK, let's say you do figure out how to tax churches. Where I live, and I know it happens in other places, big-box stores annually protest their property tax bill just because they don't want to pay that amount. Most of the time, that is settled out of the protest procedure. So if churches get taxed, you have to let them be able to dispute their amount. Then say they settle out of the system, too. But, for example, you have the Catholics getting a better deal than the United Methodists. So does that show the government favors one denomination over another? Gasp! So would taxing churches mean you have to rewrite the Constitution?	0

"Simply put, in President Trumps writing of his ""second executive order"" banning foreign travelers from entering the US, it is still based upon what the first executives travel ban order was based upon; as both executive orders are relatively the same exact order!  In order to understand Trumps mindset in crafting the travel ban, get contextual insight and see the fullness of what and who are targeted by this travel ban, you have to include what was said on the Trump campaign trail and what was talked about when he took office; in order to get the full picture.  Or to put it simply the ""first executive order"" written by Prez Trump is not superceded by the ""second executive order"" as they are in essence the same, with only a slight difference in ""technical definition"" or use of words, while the intent is still the same for both executive orders."	0

Within the Japanese Government and Emperor Hirohito was keeping his own counsel.  Japan was expecting a  land invasion. Hiroshima and the southern Islands of Japan was heavily manned by combat troops. There were Japanese Expectation of 33% casualty rate on Allied Forces before they landed.  The Japanese didn't  respond and tragically mixed among the civilians were military in Hiroshima.

"These large awards are ""two edged.""  First, of course, they raise the premiums on malpractice insurance which raises the cost of health care for all of us.  On the ""flip-side"" you would hope they also encourage conscientious medical practice.    No one would argue that such an award really compensates for the loss of a loved one.  We could make the same argument that the inprisonment or execution of a murderer doesn't compensate for the loss of life.  However, both the civil and criminal justice systems do ""the best they can.""  Dr Lieberman suggest doing ""less"" on the civil side would be an improvement.  I disagree.    At the risk of sounding a bit harsh, let me suggest he might, instead, work with doctors and other health care professionals to reduce the incidence of malpractice.  Gary Crum"	0

Its funny that I was just thinking this the other day. Reading the article has me also thinking that its easy to criticise and dislike something. Armchair quarterbacking being a lot of fun after all.

Yeah, Arlene...probably not that hard to do.  They ran with the 'WMD' bakwa'as just like the rest did in 2003, didn't they?  And they lie by omission concerning occupied Palestine, and have for years.  Did they cover it when the former head of the Naval Board of Inquiry publicly admitted he'd been coerced into claiming that the attack on the USS Liberty was an accident despite knowing it wasn't?  No.  And no other major organ of the US media covered it either.  Nor did they cover to press release CAIR issued in condemnation of the 911 attacks.  They lie, Arlene.  All of 'em do.	0

"""Terrorism terrorizes advocates of gun control and supporters of gun rights alike.""  No, actually. Every one of these incidents has happened where the shooter expected to encounter no armed resistance until police arrived.  Dionne's myopic assertion that this only happens regularly in the U.S. misses the fact that it also happens in places where extreme gun control is already in place. The bad guys still seem to acquire and use whatever weapons they see fit. The common theme, wherever these atrocities are committed and by whomever commits them for whatever purpose, is that those they attack are not armed and capable of responding immediately and must wait for someone who is armed to arrive, intervene and end the attack. Americans are in a unique position to demonstrate this, and in fact sometimes we do, but that is not headline news because few if any people die except maybe the bad guy. Wouldn't it be better if that were the case more often? Carry and be ready."	0

Therein lies the rub, Roland.  If we are to accept that paternalism is OK (is it?) and the poor and uneducated need to be protected (from their own poor decisions?), then how far do you go and where do you draw the line?  Grant recipients draw attention because they are clearly extremely poor and the intention of the grant is to provide for basic needs - food, shelter etc, not cellphone airtime and funeral policies (culture clash here).  But they are simply the thin edge of a very thick and stinky wedge.  How far do we go down this road?  -Bar anyone earning less than X from all casinos and slots places (ever seen the cars parked outside casinos? Not Mercs or BMW - lots of old skedonks, and lots of pensioners at the tables) -Bar these same people from the tote / horse racing betting shops. -Ditto bottle stores -Ditto cigarette sales -Ditto shebeens / taverns.	0

"You're suggesting that because terrorists are inspired by religion, that somehow gives them a pass from criticism?  Where every country with a large Muslim population or immigration is experiencing huge human rights violations, world is supposed to sit on its hands and be quiet, and ignore how radicalized version of Islam have resulted in thousands of terrorist attacks?

Li was the original purchaser of False Creek (175 acres) after Expo 86. That property made Concorde Pacific. The purchase price was $320 million spread out over 15 years, and the province paid to have all the contaminated soil removed as it was ex-industrial land. He's not involved in Concorde anymore (I think it's his son), but they still have a big track of undeveloped land leftover from that purchase.	0

Bonnie, I appreciate your comments and the link.  Always nice to have this kind of input and follow up.  I really don't dispute that the LSRR methodology is more comprehensive and is bound to produce more accurate and meaningful results.  But human nature being what it is when it comes to personal finance my suspicion is that for many people (if not most) the quality of the data will be the weak link.  Between the willingness to commit the time and the ability to reasonably estimate their current and future scenarios the margin of error can be significant.  Which is why the replacement ratio exists or persists - it is relatively quick and easy to compute and provides individuals with a general guideline of where they should expect to be.    For my own purposes I have always employed an approach that would be closer to the LSRR - but I am fairly confident that I devote a lot more time to personal finance than the average person.	0
"""I can say without a doubt that Michael Lee (letters, June 9) doesn’t know what he’s talking about.""  Wow! That's pretty arrogant.  Lee's observations are no more or less valid than your own. Way too soon to pass judgement on how well the new design will work year round. The winter months, with more darkness and rain, will be a good test as to how well traffic moves and how safe it is for pedestrians, bicyclist, and motorist alike.  And why shouldn't South Willamette be a motorized vehicle friendly zone also (whatever that means)?  Are people who choose to drive (many of whom no longer can ride a bike or walk very far) second class citizens?  Seems to me that a person is a person is a person and should be treated with courtesy and respect. whether they choose to walk, ride a bike, or drive a car.   Lastly, anytime you mix cars and bikes on the same roadway, there will be an element of danger involved.  People are fallible and make mistakes. No matter what means of transportation."	0

In finding a solution, let's not forget the 19 percent (about 1 out of 5) of victims of sexual abuse by RC clergy in the US that have come forward with credible accusations who are girls. At this time we don't know about clergy exploitation of girls (or boys) in third-world countries. Finding a solution without considering 20% of the victims or regional customs would be inadequate in my opinion. Sean Ratigan and Joel Wright  both had targeted young girls as examples of more recent exploitation of female children that have made the news. Any solution to the problem of sexual exploitation of youth must not dodge the significance of male-on-female attractions  and our daughters must also be protected and not ignored in this cleanup process.  I do want to make clear that your comment in no way  excludes the protection of girls, just that it concentrated on protection of males.  I am sure you seek  the protection of all minors.	0

Screens of the Satish Sea indeed. 28 year old renter on Finn Hill here. A frequent user of the park to boot. Believe me, it would of been my pleasure to pay the taxes necessary to keep the park, indeed, all state parks well funded and we'll maintained. Alas, rebuilding an old pool, seminary, and basketball court is a bit of a stretch when you consider the appitite of locals to see their property tax go up. Maybe useage fees? I buy my early parks pass, but I know if those cost was truly reflected it would be much, much more. Us millennial want the peace and quiet as much as anyone else, but we are also pragmatic civic citizens. If we want, we must pay. Dear author, if you want Saint Edward's to remain free from consumerism, write an OpEd about the importance of park levies, property tax revenue, and sales tax, and direct it towards the locals who have been around the longest. They're the ones whom elected officials listen the most too.	0
Non-changing (rigid) religions are also shrinking , include those with male only clergy/leaders/pastors:  EOC, Mormons, Southern Baptists.  Eastern Orthodox Churches are shrinking in membership in the US., have one of the lowest rates of retention across Christian and non-Christian denominations, with only 53% of adults who were raised in the Orthodox Church still identify themselves as Orthodox Christians.  Compare that to Hindus (80%), Jewish (75%), Mormon (64%) and Catholic (59%).   The conservative Southern Baptist Church  have recorded a loss of membership for each of the last 9 years and lost  200,000 adult members between 2013 and 2015.  15% of Amish leave their childhood church as adults.  Rigidity is either not enough or is rejected by many.   Half of the 'nones' in the US left their childhood religion over lack of belief, and 20% cited dislike of organized religion in a recent Pew survey.  Rigidity or male-only priests/pastors apparently doesn't prevent shrinkage.	0
This is what you get for electing an immature Prime Minister who puts his party's standing in the polls ahead of national defense.

After almost 2 years in office, he keeps kicking the can down the road.

"The rifle used was, apparently, a 10 rd SKS. It's also a 50 year old semi-auto design, and unlike the AR-15 was actually issued to military forces, but semi-auto technology, for hunting and military, goes back well over a century and they all operate essentially the same.   There are more animals than moose in the world. The AR-15 was introduced as a hunting rifle in 1963, (with 30 rd magazines as standard factory equipment) and has been used as such by millions since. It's a versatile system, available in a multitude of calibers suitable for use on all game, and easily changed from one to another. That's why the AR pattern rifle is the most popular rifle sold.  Of course, ""utility for hunting"" is not anywhere listed as the sole or primary reason most people own firearms, and the AR pattern is useful for all of them, sport, target, plinking, an self-defense. There are more than 10 million extant and yet rifles of all types are rarely used in any sort of crime, including mass shootings."	0

A touching and poignant description of the bittersweet effects of  dementia. Our family is going through this now, as my father, formerly a skilled and competent peadetrician has just been admitted into a home. What was once an assured and strong voice has been cut down to a wavering and unsure figure. Amidst the heartbreak of this deterioration though, one holds on to the occasional flashes of his former self--his bolshiness and impish sense of humour. This mixture of a new father is still deserving of love.	0

They should return their pay for the past 5-6 months back to the US Treasury, if they were honest people.  Happy King Kamehameha Day, to you.	0

All they have  is a failed ideology, and a common hatred for a President that is super charging the economy and creating Jobs in the states that voted for him.  The only way he loses in 2020 is if there is a recession which honestly  is a 50/50 probability.  But the Liberals will never accept their failed ideology and must attack Trump at all costs because if the economy goes well so do Ohio, Pennsyslvania, Michigan and they can't win without those states, so their best bet is to push Russian Scandal and hope and pray that there is a picture is of him getting a stack 100's from Putin , Good luck!	0

So, the people who seem to be, for want of a better word, celebrating what 45 and his merry band are doing, are you Canadians or just trolls from elsewhere; because if you are the former, my question to you is, do you hate JT/Bombardier more than you love your country?   I'm no fan of tax $S going to Bombardier, particularly given what they've done with those $$ lately-and they should be made to survive on their own- but I also don't like the fact that Canada is being pushed around by a foreign country, with a leader like that.  Besides, isnt Boeing  also heavily subsidized?   Where I come from you can beat up on your siblings all you want but anyone else better not even think about it.  The giddiness being displayed here is beyond pathetic.  We would all do well to remember Martin Niemöller's words; it might be Bombardier now, your industry might be next.	0

Couillard is the most pro-Canadian premier Québec has ever had, something the author neglects to mention. Very different than Bourassa who was at heart a Québec nationalist. Sad to see a once robust community fade out, and with no new blood coming into the education system because of Bill 101, the permanent decline is inevitable. Tiresome to see the Nationalist mantra about 'best treated minority' when Anglophones built all of their institutions in the province -- nothing was handed to them. The trade off with Bill 101 is that Toronto has become the undisputed economic and cultural heart of Canada, which owes a small nod to all of the outflow of capital and population from la belle province.	0

No one is contending that Russia 'hacked the election.' They influenced the election by releasing stolen information intended to help your candidate.  And you want the US intelligence agencies to publicly reveal sources and methods to 'prove' these charges? The Kremlin would love that just as they love it when some Americans, including Trump, actively disparage and demoralize the agencies assigned to keep our nation safe.	0
So....what's new?	0
Yes.  Actually, it is very narrowly tailored.  Pope Francis meant it for a very small subset of Catholics who cannot for whatever reason use the annulment tribunals.  I'd like for the annulment tribunals in general to be dismantled and for a discernment process to be used similar to the Orthodox Church, but that isn't what Amoris Laetitia does.  It is a VERY narrow opening.  As I pointed out, I doubt that either it or the annulment reforms are having much of an impact on the ground.  I still read lots of griping about the tribunals online in both Catholic and secular forums and I have yet to hear about anyone receiving Communion who is remarried who wasn't already doing so prior to Amoris Laetitia.	0

"In my childhood, those words meant a boy was unathletic or timid or prone to emotional outbursts. None of us knew those words had anything to do with sex, because none of us had more than a very vague notion what sex was.  If the bishops had written a directive about acceptance of gender non-conforming behavior, that would have been halfway understandable. But they didn't; they wrote one about same-sex attraction. I don't know what the numbers are for boys, but most gender non-conforming girls do not grow up to be lesbians and many, if not most, lesbians are not gender non-conforming.  And I somehow think they would not object to bullying gender non-conforming girls. Pope Francis often speaks derisively of, e.g., ""machismo in una gonella,"" which is not quite the same as saying b--l d--e, but not so far off either."	0

Lost control of the mob and they were off and at it again. This is now a gathering of themes, the election, lgbt rights, homeless, anarchists, BLM. Pretty much the kitchen sink.

"We should separate the issue of what their pittance wage here gets them in their home country. That's just more justification for exploiting someone. Words like ""some"" don't address those who are truly being trafficked. Not all of the same crews return for 10 years. ""Some"" are being trafficked. Working without a contract or with that useless ""Universal"" contract is unacceptable. Being denied adequate food and medical treatment is unacceptable. Bedbug infestations is unacceptable and a public health issue. Working 20-hour shifts is unsafe. And this is not another out-of-control social media splurge and it is not news. It has been reported by local news since at least 2013 and by fisheries observers for over a decade. In 2012 a crewman died trying to rid his boat of bedbugs which resulted in officials hauling off disgustingly infested mattresses from the fleet. They can't find local workers because the fishery isn't sustainable without a special law to allow human trafficking."	0

The so-called Drug War has been trying to stop trafficking for coming up on 50 years, and the problem has only gotten worse. Doubling down on the same failed approach will just be throwing good money after bad. It might feel good, but it's a game of Whack a Mole. No matter how heads you hit, more pop up, endlessly. As long as money can be made. As long as there is demand.   I think it's time for an approach that recognizes it as an illness and a public health focus. To work on the demand side. That worked well to reduce tobacco use (although there are still some smokers), and can likely make some deep inroads into opioid abuse.    So for my part, my taxes going to treatment, needle exchanges and Suboxone is a lot better investment than dumping more into law enforcement. To follow the science of addiction toward whatever solutions that leads toward.   To do anything other than continuing the old failed approaches.	0
"""... hint as to your own interest in this issue?"" I might turn around the statement.  The plain simple fact is, I know far too many judges and lawyers personally.  And when they have to use the system for a plain simple thing like a divorce or litigation in an investment they finally understand.  As an executive for 30 years, the 2 private companies I worked for were in litigation 3 times.  We won all 3 times, twice by judge in Canada and once by summary judgement in USA.  Our adversaries tried to use every delay tactic in the book, unfortunately for them they did not know we had deep pockets.   I was also responsible for corporate legal work where we used national firms, some of the lawyers are now judges.  I guess my problem, once they had a few drinks in them they didn't realize I would remember when they would criticize others in their profession or the system."	0
The illegal drug trade in Vancouver is probably behind a lot of it. When was the last time a drug dealer got arrested in Vancouver? Right now we have a lot of illegal Pot shops in Vancouver just being ignored by officials who swore to uphold our laws.

The Senate may hold the new legalization of Pot up for years until they are satisfied the government got it right. There is still no credible poll showing Canadian families support legalized Pot.	0

So, Beanie wants to take money from some  people!  In your words he wants to take from some to give to others. So, who gets to choose who is less worthy to keep their own money.  Beanie?  You?  And when did having an inheritance become a crime? You spend too much time worrying about how to get your hands on other people's money rather than trying to figure out how to make some of your own. That is the Beanie Sanders way!  . Socialism is nothing new. Been tried in many forms and many lands and each time, it always  falls flat on its sad face. Beanie simply wants to recycle some very  bad social engineering  and   socialistic  exploitation of people and put his own stamp on it.

"The only change I'd like to make is qualified voting to help insure less fools in office by insuring less fools vote.  I never understood the mentality behind trying to get (or force) everyone to vote when most people have trouble breathing and walking at the same time (looking at you Ontario). What has this done for us so far?  I would give the vote to anyone who has finished high school, paid their taxes, honorable military service and a host of other qualifications along these lines.  I would suspend the vote from anyone with dual citizenship, criminal record (for X years), unpaid fines/taxes and other disqualifications along these lines.  The current system is nothing but a high school popularity contest won by whoever has the best hair, pays out the most money for attack ads and buys votes with our own money (to unions, first nations, CBC...).

There is the unknown figure of how much CO2 is generated by undersea volcanoes. That CO2 is added directly into the oceans, although it would influence conditions at the boundary layer of ocean/atmosphere where CO2 can transfer in or out of the atmosphere/ocean.

I think that volcanic activity may be due for an uptick here in the decades ahead as the planet is due for the next cooling trend.	0

Along those same lines, Natural and Built LLC, the developers of Arete are asking for a parking modification to the number of parking stalls required for its residents.  In other words, they would like a reduction from what was required at the time of construction.  Appears this entity did a study on three dates at 0200 and found that spaces were going unused.  Too bad they didn't think to check out street parking at 5pm and run the plates of owners.  From where we live, we see folks getting out of cars and walking to Tera or Arete.  Why pay for building parking when you can park for free on the streets?  When Urban is comppleted, will it then get worse with employees from the mall?

All the affordable housing are not bought by locals, but by foreigners.  Makes me wonder if their countries are paying for it so one day when it is too late, the US/Hawaii will realize that Hawaii is no longer owned by Americans.  So sad...  So sad... where'd I hear that before?"	1

(1/2) Liz- thanks for reading and commenting.  In the spirit of debate I'd like to respond to your comments. -The scientific case you refer to and that's outlined in Schatz's letter lacks proof that longline fishing is a threat to the habitat, biodiversity, or cultural artifacts in the proposed area.  And so I'd say the sasquatch analogy may be more appropriate for the argument in support.               -Pseudoscience is a term I used to call out proponents' willingness to mistake activism for science.  Activism wearing the guise of science is a form of pseudoscience.    -Who among the proponent camp is an expert in pelagic ecosystems?  The area in question is very different from the area within the current boundary.  When it comes to a scientific understanding of the proposed area I would argue that the pro-monument scientists and other supporters aren't so well credentialed.  And so to borrow your phrase, they are kind of a JV squad.	0

Your argument is better than most, GS, but it still has fatal shortcomings.  TWU doesn't deny entry to ANYONE. Everyone is welcome, regardless of their religion, sexual orientation, etc. Those who enter voluntarily agree to abide by certain rules. LSUC, however, DOES deny entry to certain people: those who got their law degrees at Trinity Western.  I can certainly accept that LSUC may establish rules for its membership, just as TWU does. For example, LSUC could state explicitly that their members must offer professional services to anyone regardless of the sexual orientation. Voila! Problem solved, no?   However that's not the approach LSUC has taken. Rather, it seeks to exert influence over a religious institution by denying entry to those who are or were members of it.	0

just one more of trump's decisions gone south. his ego is so huge and infantile, he  must be livid - it is surprising he hasn't had a stroke or heart attack... sincerely.  he's overweight, 70 yrs old, a very driven personality. that kind of pressure blows when it blows. apparently, by many, many accounts, he just rages around in the white house. like the world's most spoiled brat. i can't imagine his rage about this, his best plan ever.    and he must be figuring out by now that the US is not a monarchy, and he did not get crowned for life.   we have a system that is based on checks and balances. he's tried,  and still works at throwing out as much garbage out there every day to try to obscure real issues.  our government,  with his ineptness at the  helm,  is got him in a stalemate - i hope - so far,  he's tried to strong arm it, sneak around it, lie to it, and stonewall it. and the USA democracy still stands in spite of him. hope i can say that in a year from now.	0

The older I get, the less inclined I am to advocate war, no matter how good the cause. (Considering that our Constitution makes it illegal to advocate war even if South Africa were attacked or the ghost of Verwoerd came to power, perhaps that's just as well.)  Do you find some of Trump's ideas intolerant? I do. Do I think it justifies armed rebellion? No, I don't. Do I find some of Zuma's ideas intolerant? Yes, I do. Would I advocate a violent overthrow? Absolutely not.   Only when those in power assume dictatorial powers, or egregiously disregard the rule of law, would I even consider recognising the need for a violent response, and then only when all peaceful avenues have been exhausted. I'm not convinced that the intolerance of those in power even has much to do with it, as long as you can peacefully remove them from power.	0

I've been hiking in the BC interior for 25 years and have had many encounters with black bears. When they see me they either run away or climb a tree, even mothers with cubs.   In my experience, the danger of a mother bear with cubs is vastly exaggerated.  A few years ago there was a black bear cub spotted up a tree during a local jazz festival. The organisers shot it out of the tree and managed to traumatize the children who were there.  It's time we stopped being jerks about bears.	1
"'There's no good jobs for the young Canadians already here ...""  Oh, contraire!  Come to Chilliwack BC, Canadian unemployed and under-employed.

My brother in law reinforced it the other night...he's a partner trying to hire a physically able shipper/receiver in a successful wholesale distribution company. $14/hr. start. Raise in 6 months for good performance.  His story is interesting: he received just six resumes--4 from women. ""The two guys were duds, you could tell that from their resumes,"" he said.  One guy: 8 jobs in 2 years (!). The women? No experience, but eager to leave retail and receptionist positions behind. Physically able?  Maybe...  So, he called a manager of a similar local firm. Got any leads? he asked. The guy on the other end laughed, ""You kidding' me?  We're looking, too!"""	0

Douglas,  I agree.  While the administration is responding with FEMA and other support, the people expect that the President will be there, physically and show real concern.   Golf and vacation are not the appropriate things to do for the leader of our nation when people are suffering en masse.  He did the same thing after an American was beheaded by ISIS.  He had a brief statement and then headed back to the golf course.    At least President Bush cut his vacation short, flew over the area to assess the damage and then a few days later went to New Orleans.   In that circumstance, it would have been a distraction because the flooding  was still active and roads etc. were cut off.	0

"Well, it's great that some Catholics were inspired to learn something about science. Catholics, and other Christians, should be encouraged to do much much more of that, in fact. I happen to find evolutionary biology more interesting and meaningful than astronomy, but whatever grabs you, go with it.  On the other hand, the total eclipse in itself, or else the precision with which astronomers predicted the path of totality across the US, is not anything like a ""proof of God's existence"" -- as though God were the sort of being whose existence could be detected in that sort of thing. If anything, it's really only the interest of human beings in this phenomenon, and their awed aesthetic / intellectual reaction, that can point to something divine, present in our minds."	0

"1/2 President Obama, like other presidents of both parties, was critical of judicial decisions with which he disagreed. He expressed that criticism firmly, sometimes even harshly. But he did not -- ever -- question the legitimacy of a federal judge (""this so-called judge"") or the integrity of a federal judge (because the judge was of Hispanic descent.)  Among American presidents, Trump is unique in his contempt for the rule of law and for American values and institutions. Will you take a crack at the questions I've posed to other Trump supporters (none of whom has answered): How would the right have responded -- ... if President Obama had dismissed a federal judge who ruled against him as ""this so-called judge""? ... if a federal judge had dismissed President Trump as ""this so-called president""? ... if President Obama or Secretary Clinton had posited, as Trump did, a moral equivalency between the homicidal maniac Putin and the American people, their military and their government?"	0

DeVos Dept. of Education sued for ignoring request for info on sexual harassment investigations --------  Title IX, which is a federal law which requires schools that receive federal funding to properly respond to and prevent sexual violence, is enforced by the Department of Education. Title IX has to do with civil rights—something that Betsy DeVos doesn’t seem too concerned with. During the confirmation, DeVos declined to answer multiple inquiries about whether she would enforce the civil rights of American students, and the ignored FOIA request hints that she has no intention of doing so. The fact is, she willingly serves as a member of a sexual predator’s presidential cabinet.  And that’s precisely why the Department’s refusal to share information is so important.	0
Hey Sweeney. Interesting point.  Sadly, the polls were correct. Clinton won the popular vote by about 3% which is what many polls predicted. That's approximately 2  million more who voted for Clinton.  Trump only won because of the nature of the Electoral college system and where the votes counted. So you are factually wrong in your claim. Yes the pollsters take a credibility hit for not predicting the exact outcome,  but then you saying they were wrong about everything is a lie. She was winning until near the end. But I don't expect the facts to change your mind. They are inconvenient to your media conspiracy theory and poll hating world view..	0

Iran is not a peaceful country that develops a weapon in total secrecy and suddenly stuns the world. Iran is closely watched, inspected and monitored to ensure compliance to a legally binding treaty with stiff penalties.  You also completely don't understand nuclear deterrence. Assuming you can even use low yield tactical weapons to strike these hardened underground facilities (which you can't with an air burst) you still have to hit the enemy in a way they can't hit back. That means warheads and mobile launchers, subs and planes.  The US does not possess a nuclear bunker buster bomb, and an air burst won't hit the ground hard enough. That means surface detonation that MIGHT manage to collapse a facility but even then might not.	0

Just a question....do the Muslims in Canada really think this motion is about bigotry OR do they think its about banning any criticism of Islam and its religion and reintroducing blasphemy laws in Canada. Does the MP behind the motion feel that criticism of Islam and its prophet is acceptable? I think we know the answer.   In every Muslim country the penalty for blasphemy is very serious including death. you simply can't criticize the religion or the prophet Mohamed no matter what. This includes violent passages in the Koran and Hadith, the punishment for non-believers (including the extermination of Jews as we found out recently with the Mosque in Toronto), nor any mention of the immorality of the Prophet Mohamed....and his child bride.  For muslims coming to Canada in greater numbers this is their reality. No freedom of speech.   Blasphemy is what this is really about.

Figure... this applies to every salaried worker... the store clerk, the government worker, the gas station attendant... does the CEO who gets 200x the accountant work 200x as hard or generate 200x the value? Of course not.   Specialists are not getting paid more for doing the work of 2 doctors. They're getting paid twice as much to see less patients than a GP. Who is more valuable? The GP who helps his patients reduce his cholesterol or the heart surgeon doing a triple bypass on someone who didn't? To make more than $2 million as a specialist requires you spend less time doing surgery and more time supervising a team of people or machines (I.e. Laser eye surgery) do it for you.	0

Such a cruel and heartless viewpoint. A dog in the manger view; I've got mine, and the rest of you can go to hell. Do you know why people go on Medicaid? Because they were laid off. Because their spouse, who should've been handling the finances better, racked up too much debt. Because the spouse who was the breadwinner unexpectedly dies and you were the homemaker and had been out of the job market for 20+ years. Because you got too sick to work and lost their job. Because you were hit by a car and are now paralyzed and need round the clock care. We won't be able to pay for anything if they keep handing out tax cuts to the rich.	1

How is this ridiculous? Perhaps if those 86 fools in France would have just gotten out of the way, there would have been no reason to shoot the driver. A few years ago,  where I live, in the Austin area, a driver in an SUV purposely plowed into a supermarket and killed 1 customer and crippled the niece of a friend of mine who just didn't manage to make the choice to get out of the way.  Off the top of my head, I can think of another time someone drove their vehicle into a Luby's restaurant in Temple, TX and 23 people were just too stupid to get out of the way of the vehicle and the driver's bullets. It's a miracle that no one died in this incident, and it would have been wise for anyone with a clear shot to assume this was a terrorist and remove the threat.	1

"So your argument is simple an appeal to nature ?   You know that's a fallacy right.   And if capitalism was REALLY the way 'nature works' everybody in capitalist countries would be living to the ripe old age of death-by-childbirth at age 16. Because THAT is what NATURE had in mind for our species.  Everything we've achieved we've done by giving nature a pretty big middle finger.   Not to mention the claim is utterly ludicrous - since nature has nothing resembling capitalism. There's no concept of trade in nature and almost no species have any concept of ""mine"" let alone of ""property"".  On the other hand - successful socialist societies DO occur in nature.

We have seen both initiative and recall efforts ""weeded out"" when they've failed to achieve the required number of signatures.  Secondly, the election itself is a further ""test"" of the initiative.  Supporters of an initiative, once they've successfully gotten it on the ballot, must then gather the support of a majority of the voters to have the initiative adopted.    Those special interests supporting this initiative veto measure do so because they fear the initiatives referenced  a) are, in fact, constitutional and b) just might get on the ballot and c) just might be adopted.  BTW: The initiative process has been part of the US Constitution and the Oregon Constitution for over a hundred years.  It is certainly a ""legitimate process"" and a key part of American democracy.   regards, Gary Crum"	0

"As a nurse in this state for decades, I have given depositions in medical lawsuits and have been on a jury a few years ago that was a major medical lawsuit.  ""Standards of Care"" are often evaluated when a medical facility wants to get rid of  a licensed staff member who they put up with for a long time for months even years before the administration finally gets their medical attorneys to say how and when that licensed staff member violated the ""standards of care"" fro practicing medicine in this state, but it is not done often.  Such medical ""standards of care"" are used in medical lawsuits as a means to measure a licensed staff members job performance and if it is basically what other medical licensed staff would do in the same cases. Now in the state of Alaska, the prosecuting attorneys don't know enough to know any more that something is not right but they don't know exactly what so they let the medical board deal with it.

Melo was a great player for the Nuggets, offensively, but he doesn't deserve to have his jersey retired here. He had a Lebronesque departure from Denver, albeit milder, and never came back. I would have reconsidered these feelings if he had come back here but doubtful that will ever happen. His terrible defense and effort on the defensive side were infuriating to watch. Those teams could have done so much more and maybe even beat Kobe one season if not for Melo's half ass style of play. He was an offensive genius here in Denver, I was a big fan, but now he annoys me more than anything. So don't retire his jersey he's not worthy of it despite his outstanding offensive play for 7 years I think it was. Sorry Melo.	1

The problem, of course, is how love is defined.  If you want to learn what love is, look to parents (after all God is our father); or better yet, become a parent.  Parents love their children by teaching them; and isn't that what Jesus really did?  Teach?    And here's the part that no one likes:  you just can't say ""Be nice.""  You have to teach the bad with the good:  DO this DON'T do that.  Love requires expressions of approval and expressions of disapproval.  There are good works and there is sin.

"Charter schools are a fantastic alternative for inner-city kids - and the per-child subsidy would follow the child whether it be public or Charter. Thomas Sowell says ""Some of these charter schools -- especially those in the chain of the Success Academy schools and the chain of the KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program) schools are operating in low-income, minority neighborhoods in the inner-cities, and are turning out graduates that match educational performances of students in affluent suburbs. What is even more remarkable, these charter schools are often housed in the very same buildings, in the very same ghettoes, where students in the regular public schools fail to learn even the basics in English or math. You and I may think this is great. But, to the teachers' unions, such charter schools are a major threat to their members' jobs -- and ultimately to the unions' power or existence.""

I've kept a loose hold on my spiritual reigns and that has helped me at some tough times.    I prefer to believe most of the philosophy of Jesus, which for anyone who studied it, was a serious reform of the entire spririt, visions of religious leaders of that time.    It's a very different vision of God from the Judgemental authority of the old testament.   Well, it is to me - clearly many Christian church's don't agree.     I can't prove the exisitence of God, but I find love and compassion solid foundations for a happy life.    It helps if your life is finacially secure - a dwindling promise for many.	0
Garbage!	1
Our choices this election cycle are simple:  worse or worse.  Personally, I think we should all get a great big do-over this time around.  Speaking out against a disgusting chest thumping lout like Mr. Trump does not equate to being either a Bill or Hillary Clinton fan.  Is it any wonder so many voters feel alienated from the process and exhibit total apathy when it comes to showing up at the polls?	0
Impeachment is more of a political decision than a criminal one, so yeah, the GOP does have the power to remove a sitting President.  Not unilateral as it takes 2/3 of the Senate, but the GOP would have to start the balll rolling.  If they go down that road, we will have President Pence.	0
I'm neither republican or democrat, I'm a registered independent since 1970. My hate/dislike or contempt for Washington [D] & [R] Elitist Party Insiders is actually co-equal and in fact I did not vote for Trump or Hillary I wrote my choice in. That being said, long before the last election I have watched the destructive implosion of the Democrat Party taking place. But from nearly the primary/election start the majority/or large portion of the [D] party has turned hatefulness and violence into the daily status quo. And without any question IMO the Clintons represent pure evil in most everything they come in contact with. I have nearly the same hate/dislike for the republicans freedom caucuses for their brand of greed and contempt for the everyday citizen, especially those who are truly in need of health care help. As of now neither party is doing their job to serve and provide the service citizens rightfully deserve. But IMO the [D] party is by far the worse of the two.	0

Few become aware, let alone make connection with any who are ""struggling financially, as well as socially with divorce and estrangement, addiction and suicide""."	0

Overall Trump won approximately 2,600 counties to Clinton’s 500, or about 84% of the geographic United States. However, Clinton won 88 of of the 100 largest counties (including Washington D.C.).

"What is the rightful place of Hawaiians today? That's easy to answer.  Admit that history happens and rewriting the past is impossible. Stop with victim stuff already.   Play the hand history has dealt.  Get educated and acquire modern-day knowledge and skills.  Work to earn money and support families.  Become financially independent.  Get elected to the State Legislature.  Seize power from within the perceived evil White man's government.  Become our first Hawaiian governor!  Oops, too late for that last one.  We already elected him, and the State was broke when he left office.   On the other hand, if Hawaiians really want to stick it to the U.S. government, insist we send back to Washington all the money the Feds give us for welfare, infrastructure, military, and on and on.  It is beyond hypocritical to moan and groan about the ""illegal"" government, then take millions of dollars from the ""illegal"" government."	0

Trump has far more responsibility at stake than does Pope Francis, who is essentially a spectator in white, who has no skin in the game, other than his green reputation.

The defense shouldn't want any women on the jury.  Women scourge the likes of Chief Kealoha as either a whimp to an overbearing wife or else, a dominant male.

This is a stunning example of the post-factum knuckle cracking and hand wringing that is now standard fare in Archbishop Hart's public statements. It serves to illustrate the high-priced level of spin, hubris and dissemblance that Hart and others have turned into a art form. The Archbishop's consultation is restricted almost entirely to his Curia - ""We know everything"" Hart has said - and to his business manager. He has created a sterile zone between himself and the people in his care and this is little more than unctuous bleats."	0

Just how little has changed was driven home for me on Friday when I heard that Trump again referred to Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” in his speech to the NRA. I understand that he’s afraid of Warren; he always has been. I also understand that he thinks her claim to have a Native American heritage presents a political opportunity for her opponents -- but his use of the name of a Native American hero as a slur demeans him and the presidency. During the election, I sometimes referred to Trump as “Dirty Donald”, imitating his proclivity for naming his political foes (Little Marco, Lyin’ Ted, Crooked Hillary, etc.); it seemed appropriate shorthand for a man who has lived a filthy life personally, professionally and politically. I discontinued the reference on November 9, not because I suddenly acquired respect for him, but because I do respect the office to which he was elected. It’s too bad he doesn’t respect it. What a despicable, filthy, cowardly, petty little man this president is.	1
