THe hearings are on as I type this, and you are very much mistaken. The AG has jurisdiction over the laws, and he is currently being asked about the Violence Against Women Act - something he voted AGAINST in 2013, for just one example.

That's a tough one.  It's a fine line between free speech and hate speech.  My worry is if banned, that will just allow the alt-right to claim they are victims of censorship and embolden them more.  Better to call them out on their nonsense and teach people the dangers of such groups.	0

The ANC should not be the next government, I agree. They've had their chance, and made a big mess of it. Question is, how good will the DA be? Or the EFF? I'll vote for one of them to bring about change, not because I believe in their message. Personally, I hope a split happens, and a new party emerges. New beginnings, new brooms, new hope. There are more than a few very good people who could lead such a party.	0

yes, schools need to spend the money they have on more counselors, PBIS models and hire only staff and administration who are trained in, and have high Emotional IQ with degrees in the specialty they are teaching in that are NOT from online schools as some of these staff and admin have. And they need DOUBLE the amount of counselors in each school in addition to not refusing children who are learning disabled IEPS and REAL services. Its time to put money into children not sports and other non essential items.	0
"If we refuse to construct natural gas plants in Southern Ontario because it is harmful to the spirit of the community, this makes sense.  If we attach a name to a natural place that is beautiful and powerful, the courts choose to rationalize the situation in purely religious terms.  This imposes Christianity embodiment on the term ""spirit.""  It goes without saying that God has no penis or testicles.  But he is portrayed as a male - usually Caucasian - due to this incessant need need to rationalize the embodiment of things and dismiss the perceptions of others.  I certainly won't be visiting any resorts in British Columbia.  I consider the province insensitive and disrespectful of culture.  I don't think anyone with any sense of environmental activism can support this development either politically or with their vacation savings."	0

The contract, the details of which have never been made public under both the Harper and Trudeau Govts would be the key here, no?  If our contract has stipulations about acceptable use (really having a hard time picturing this) then Canada could use this as a way to get out of further shipments.     IF there is no language in the contract to cancel, then we are asking a private Canadian company to cancel a contract that carried a Canadian Govt trade guarantee.    So compensation would be warranted both for the company as well as Saudi Arabia.     So we would be paying the company for not shipping orders and we would be paying Saudi Arabia for reneging on the contract (and they can use the payment to source elsewhere).     Net benefit - zero.  So unless there is contract language to cancel (and we, as taxpayers will likely never know) then the realpolitik solution is to learn from this and not repeat the mistake for any future contracts.	0

You missed the 1 new feature that really compromises safety: centre console mounted video touch screens that drivers have to use to control anything.

Mr. Martin leaves out the biggest fantasy driving the American historical experience: the myth of the self-made man.

The same rebels that Obama has been supporting?  So your hatred of Bush overrides the reality that Obama is also supporting them?  Typical...  And Obama is the one that drew the red line in the sand and then ignored it when they crossed it. It may be too late to do anything now without starting WWIII. Obama stood and watched doing nothing after giving them an ultimatum. Now Russia is enmeshed with the Syrians and has made taking action to save people next to impossible.  Leading from behind isn't working!	0
"1. Obama inherited $10 trillion in debt from Bush, who increased it by $5 trillion after Clinton's administration had kept it around the $5.5 mark for the previous eight years. So you can hardly blame only ""Democrat norms"" for the total figure.  2. The executive branch does not have exclusive control over government spending. In fact, it has very little control relative to the Houses... which have been GOP-controlled for most of Obama's two terms. So, again, not just ""Democrat norms"".  3. Your screed re ""race hustling"" is ridiculous, and marks you as just another racist trying to cover up your racism with faux-intellectual anti-leftist conspiracy crap.  4. Pretty sure Obama has never advocated for a ""one world government"", so that must be your inane conspiracy-minded excuse for a brain speaking.   5. And finally, ""GLO-BULL"" warming--how clever! Yet unconvincing when stacked against the reams of scientific evidence supporting the existence of anthropogenic climate change; try again. :("	0

The Bush Administration did lie about everything before the war in Iraq, making up easily verified forgeries etc. with the lapdog corporate media helping them every step of the way.  Bush/Cheney did rack up Trillions in debt and blame it all on Obama.  Obama did not clean up the GOP mess.  He continued too much of Bushco,spread the wars in the middle east, homeland security, spying, went after whistleblowers....  Trump uses populism to get elected, promises to 'drain the swamp' then hires all Goldman Sachs insiders and self interested nutjobs.  They all suck.  We should really be united against all this BS the politicians put us through, but the corporate media is too successful at controlling us with petty arguments.	0
I have need seen a tax a liberal democrat isn't completely in love with this should be a slam dunk.....right? LOL	0
Yup, totally peaceful. Except for the flaming piece of whatever that was tossed at the police at the 00:12 mark of the video. So what's the protest about? Clean water? We live in AK and have the TAP. How many spills over the last 30 years from TAP? Is this about sovereignty? Why now? Why not when the other pipelines in the area were built? An agenda was picked, a narrative pushed and the reality has nothing to do with the stories being pushed. We see stories about police brutality and militarized police but so far no dead protestors in 7 months of confrontation. Also 7 months and this is allowed to continue which puts the lie to mention of a police state. Just because you want to romanticize, glamorize and empathize with the event does not justify what is going on.	0
Thanks for being so fortright about it. Yes, the notion that everyone who comes here does it because they embrace our values, want to integrate and become Canadians, is wrong, many just want the money.  Saudi Arabia is right to treat westerners who go there for the money as what they are, we should be just as smart.	0
"Now Trump accuses Obama or orchestrating a ""Nixon/Watergate"" plot?

She had 25 years to become a citizen.  The pathway may be a little backed up these days but it is not 25 years behind.  Have to laugh at people willing to spend more time and effort on skirting the rules than just following them.  On top of that she wants sympathy from the public for that choice.	0

Since this is their business, I understand having dogs in the office, especially when they seem to be confined to the owners own work space.  However, a couple employees where I work (including the Administrator) bring their dogs to work and I find it disruptive, especially when they are allowed to roam around the small office we have.  If I were to fall over one of these dogs or accidentally roll back over one, I can see legal action being taken and, of course, more divisiveness in the office depending on how one feels about animals in the work place.  My children, even as toddlers, were very well behaved and I would have liked to be able to bring them to work with me, but knew that would not be tolerated.  I feel the same about animals in the work place.	0
While it is easy at this point to continually denounce this candidate and their behaviour, my thoughts are now starting to shift away from her - she ain't going to win - to that of how the political parties of this town are choosing people to run under their flags.   In the past, a political party would vet potential candidates much more, sifting out these characters. Over the past few years, party members have demanded that the vetting process be made less severe. How the parties answered to that demand was, literally, opening up the front doors and letting any and all people come in and run for office. While that has given new opportunities for people to serve, it has also created, like in this case, binary choices between the crazy candidate and the established politician.   That is not a good choice for the electorate in any race. Political parties, if they are worth their value in society, should work to increase the quality of candidates for future races.	0

I think this article is proof the Globe is all about hiding Trudeau from any blame. Why not do an article on why people in hospitals in Ontario wait hours for doctors while at the same time our elected MP's, who make over $150,000 per year, are ensuring abortions for women in foreign countries.	0

At first glance, sounds like a good idea.  Some matters (allowing women to leave on maternity leave before giving birth) are already partially covered under EI or may be expanded with marginal cost.  Others (such as an increase in maternity leave to 18 months) are more expensive - the only question is, how much more?  EI is supposed to be self-sustaining - so the question is, will it lead to a increase in EI contributions?	0
“Either he has a blind-eye world view or the Russians really are blackmailing him.” ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Trump’s unswerving support and admiration for Putin, while insulting and disparaging everyone else (even his own security agencies) implies that the Russians do indeed have something on him.

Moscow now has its very own Manchurian Candidate in the White House	0
This shows what happens  when the Liberal government fails to firmly press its diversity and climate change demands with the Americans. Clearly, once these  laggards realize that a fully unionized and diversity-enforced work force is inevitable south of the border, they will concede to Canadian NAFTA  demands that have the advantage of being virtuously correct and morally imperative.	0

"You seem to believe that economic activity follows divinely inspired laws handed down from on high and if we just obey all will be OK.  That absolves fallible humans from responsibility for actions promoting self-enrichment at the expense of others. Thus you accept the foolishness that society has no right to control economic activity and assumes economic activity to be a personal matter outside the realm of social involvement, ignoring the truth that it's the most public of activities. You believe your personal success is due to your singular efforts and that it's personal failure if people on the verge of retirement have to wait and ""recoup"" the losses incurred as the result of very real destructive and preventable actions take by a very few that ""trickle down"" to blight the lives of everyone ""under"" them.

there are lots of reasons people pick a party, but if a party gets a vote, that vote supports the platform. you can argue people don't actually want a, b or c, but that's not how the system works. vote for a candidate in a party, you vote for the platform.   Also for power, welcome to party politics? This is also how the system works.   For whatever reason, our Westminster system produced more seats for two parties who have decided their platforms make a better fit. Not sure how that is conning the public.	0
That's just what I was thinking, fund all this with a whopping increase in the city's storm water fee; that's what Jon Ruiz likes to do.

"""Finance Minister Bill Morneau says rising home prices in Toronto and Vancouver are supported by low unemployment and higher incomes.""  Not true.  House price to income ratios are off the charts, and it was triggered by continued low interest rates and now market psychology (herd mentality) such that fundamentals such as employment and income are not driving the market.  More likely the reverse where a growing proportion of those local economies is related to real estate and residential construction, that is being reinforced by higher RE prices.  The market trend has already changed in Vancouver and is heading down; it's a question of a gradual cooling off or disorderly correction.  Toronto will run out of steam and reverse as well due to market forces, but the government may intervene to trigger it due to political pressure."	0
What absolute nonsense!  Coming from this mutt and his leanings as a Dimmocrat, it's 'par for the course'.

As we can see everywhere Islamic Jihad is the source of many wars. These wars are ideological first and territorial second.   Arab Israeli war is another example of Jihad. Arab states took 99.99% of lands from Ottoman Empire, including most of the land allocated for Arab and Jewish Palestinian states. This current war is not to give Palestinian Arabs another state, in addition to Jordan. It is to destroy Israel in stages by making it vulnerable.   Calling lands Judea and Samaria means more than the West Bank (of Jordan River). Especially for Good Samaritans, who are never called West Bankers. Indeed, West Bankers are not always Good Samaritans.	0

"Actually, since the early 70's the DTE has been a kind of micro-cosm of drug related crime and of course drug use and abuse. Now in my 60's, I have been confounded and disturbed by the apparent failures. There are many good people and agencies providing supportive housing in the DTE. But still the problems persist and new substances come along regularly and before we know it, another crisis hits.  Slowly my thinking about the causes has evolved in the direction of learning disabilities and certain types of brain dysfunction. Our society has put the ability to learn on a higher and higher pedestal. Those who find this difficult are left behind and find that coping involves many systemic barriers and disappointments that are visited upon only those with learning difficulties. Others struggle with mental illnesses.  If you don't ""fit in"" you look for a community where you can express your uniqueness. You also look for comfort and drugs offer a quick hit and momentary relief."	0
"Rodney King jeopardized others when he was driving drunk but in fact the only person harmed was King himself when Officers Powell and Koon beat him before witnesses.

All the prominent African-Americans you mention have spoken and written about their experiences of racism in the U.S. Your claim that the experiences of white celebrities are the same as the experiences of Black celebrities, therefore, is entirely specious."	1
Just a few other things. There is great variability in coding. People probably noticed the recent Medicare data showing response to lowering of reimbursement with upcoding. Some docs will use level 2s and 3s and others will use 3s and 4s or even 5s. It may be the same visit. Some endoscopists will utilize different methods or multiple methods instead of trying to stick to one method that is equally effective. The result can be vastly different coding and charges for the same visit or procedure. This is a big reason I wrote a piece on simplifying the coding system years back. There is also marked variation in use of lab and imaging studies. So you may think a lower fee schedule means a lower cost overall and be way off the mark. https://www.adn.com/voices/article/there-code/2010/04/05/	0

Of course no Republican was going to support the agenda of a community organizer, they aren't that stupid.

"I posted this response earlier and it did not meet ""civility standards"" which only makes sense if people are voting not civil because they disagree with the content rather than voting on civility.  '""...it is designed as the starting point to the socialist's quest for single payer...""  You say that like it's a bad thing. The US has the most expensive health care in the world, yet our outcomes cannot compete with single payer and/or universal health care countries.

Worst of all, and the most morally repugnant, disparities in outcome that reflect the disparities of wealth in the country. Everyone should have equal healthcare, rich or poor, and all of us in between.'   I would welcome any response explaining the incivility of this post."	0

As someone who opposes illegal immigration, I AGREE:  WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HELP OUR SUFFERING BROTHERS AND SISTERS.  That obligation, however, does not necessarily entail welcoming all the poor who wish to come.  To be quite reasonable about it, it CANNOT entail welcoming all the poor who wish to come.  Christian charity does not require any country to commit economic and cultural suicide.  There are many ways to help the world's poor without accepting everyone who makes it to our border.  What is so un-Christian or unreasonable about saying this?	0

You sure do jump to conclusions. Of course I've heard of those organizations. Do I have to rebut every single detail of every point you raise? The article I cited earlier compared funding from many hunting and nonhunting organizations. DU, NWF, and Rocky Mt. Elk are among the largest contributors you mentioned with a total of $294 million annually. How about donations from organizations of mostly non hunters? The Nature Conservancy? $859M. Wildlife Conservation Society? $230M. World Wildlife Fund? $204M. The Conservation Fund? $138M. Natural Resources Defense Council? $123M. National Audubon Society? $89M. And by the way, most NWF funding seems to be from non-hunters.  Compare those laudatory amounts with annual funding by federal agencies like FWS, NPS, USFS, and BLM which totaled $18,671 million, with an estimated 95% from non-hunters. Even most of the Pittman-Robertson funding comes from non hunters.  http://www.mountainlion.org/featurearticleguestwhopaysforwildlife.asp	0
I'm sorry but you are speaking out of both sides of your mouth. In one side you say Congress needs to wake up and on the other side you diss the one Republican Senator who was willing to stand up against all those 'do nothing' Republican Senators. Cruz, along with Mike Lee, Rand Paul (to name a few) went to the Senate to try to change the Republicans and get done what we were asking them to do. And then when they do something out of the ordinary you people trash them!  Go figure. It's a no wonder Mike Lee left. The battles required to change the Senate is hard enough but it's impossible without our support. And sometimes the Republicans don't need to compromise. Sometimes they need to get a spine and standup and fight for what we want.	0

Ok, I might have misunderstood your gun nut comment because I thought it was in reference to everyone who was against gun control. The Vegas guy was a nut of the first order. He was a subhuman asah*left too. And I do agree that a part of the NRA's goal is to protect my rights to own firearms no matter how many. But I don't see that as a bad thing. I also need to disagree with your take on the militia part of the 2nd Amendment. Nowhere does it say that the firearms are only for the militia. There was no if/then connection made or implied (in my opinion). But, again, I want to reiterate that I absolutely believe that something needs to be done. I just don't agree that more gun control is necessarily the answer.	0

Increasingly, 'lay' people are being employed for many of these 'episcopal' functions. They serve as long as they are willing, competent, and able, at the discretion of the Bishop.  Maybe that is the right direction. We just need to recognize that many 'laity' in the community already have the 'gifts'. The people can choose whom they think competent and the Bishop can appoint them to 'extend his presence'.  They don't need to be full-time, professional 'clerics' for many of those jobs. Maybe not even for ANY of them.  That's my analysis, anyway. The process in ACTS is a good one 1. Listen to the people to discover the problem 2. accept that their IS a problem,  3. Define the problem, accept one's own limitations 4. Consult with the people until all agree on a solution 5. Let the people pick their representatives and propose them for appointment.  And remember that new problems need new solutions. The 'deacon solution' was OK for that Jerusalem community problem. And only that one.	0

From Earthjustice:  The Department of Justice, Department of the Army and Department of the Interior issue a joint statement following the court order which says in part: “The Army continues to review issues raised by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other Tribal nations and their members and hopes to conclude its ongoing review soon. In the interim, the Army will not authorize constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe.

"There are a lot of problems with this article, it is clearly written by someone with an agenda, as it is lacking the usual caveats we scientists tend to work with.  Main problems:  1) The studies cited are not quite solid science. Take this quote: ""We see evidence for this in girls with a genetic condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, ..""  For us to believe that testosterone leads to these preference differences, we have to believe that people treat girls with the condition equally to girls without. Otherwise we haven't gotten any closer at disentangling the nature vs nature argument. So this study can only suggest, but it proves nothing.  2) Imagine these studies are true. They say nothing about magnitude. It is quite the leap of faith to say that there are gender differences at birth, and then use this to claim that STEM should be naturally dominated by men. There could be very real gender differences, but this tells us nothing about how many more men should be in STEM."	0

Now, full access to all discourse in and out of the governing bodies willingly blasted throughout the media.  Not an ounce of regret or shame from any of them.  Glorified by the wannabe Der Fuehrer/Il Duce Trump as he certifies it all and utters traitorous edicts to remove all Constitutional protections for the human citizens in order to create his own version of a new Empire.

Nonsense. There is a tremendous basis for concern with people from these countries including plotting terrorists. Most of the terror attacks in Europe in the last 2 years have been by people who snuck in as refugees. The US is target number one and many targets have been hit by Islamist jihadists who have in recent months gone to visit in places such as Yemen. The way to stop this is to upgrade the vetting procedures.  This 90-day pause for the 7 countries will enable the system to be secured. There was plenty of warning but there's plenty of whining anyway. The U.S. has been at war for 16 years. Trump is committed to stopping ISIS and al Qaeda and protect Americans. This will do that.  Some people live with their heads in the sand. Others have the responsibility to keep all safe. Thank goodness the wise American voters elected Trump, a man of action and promise -keeping.	0

Gba When you wrote “Trumphobe”, I knew what “phobe” meant – “denoting a person having a fear or dislike of what is specified”, https://www.google.com/search?q=phobe But I didn’t know what a “trum” was.  So I looked it up; “trum” - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=trum . Definitely a new word for me…..   I even briefly wondered if you were projecting your own fears again. But knowing that you’ve shown some strange phobia’s,  and have written some off-the-wall comments here, I paused, and read you’re comment again.   And by giving you the benefit of the doubt I decided that you’d simply misspelled “Trumpphobe”. So I searched the RG for  “William (Chico) Schwall”, and found the four letters I mentioned.  I did read them all and did read the sentence you quoted. What I read was a factual statement, with no evidence of anything “denoting a person having a fear or dislike of what is specified”. So no, I won’t be apologizing.	0

More than a decade.  In 1998 I wanted a new truck.  I priced and drove models at most Anchorage dealerships, then priced the same models outside.  Even accounting for shipping, buying outside saved me thousands of dollars.  I wanted to buy locally, so I want to the dealership and made what I thought was a very fair offer:  the cost of the outside purchase, plus the shipping, plus $1000.  The sales person literally laughed at me.  He said someone else would come in the door tomorrow and pay full price, no questions asked, so why should he take a discount to sell to me?  I pointed out that he'd be selling two trucks (one to me, one to the guy coming in tomorrow), so he'd actually be getting two commissions, but I just got another smirk.     All dealers pay the same delivery charge to the manufacturer regardless of the shipping distance.  Anchorage dealers probably have higher heating bills and salaries, but not thousands of dollars more per vehicle.  Ridiculous.	0

It would be interesting to hear about the economist's thoughts on the ever increasing gov't debt and how that should be paid or shared with future generations.  The annual interest payments alone hand cuff most gov'ts when it comes to offering services and support for their citizens.

The solution in my eyes, would be to recognize this as a given and thus limit the size of the problem by starving them of funding through austerity and tax relief.	0

Glad they are not changing it. Parties that cannot get the most votes in even a single riding shouldn't suddenly get to have five or six MPs sitting in the House, possibly holding  the balance of power, just because they got four or five per cent of the votes nationally. It's not just the Greens. You could end up with an altra-right wing party in the House, or even a religious-based party, without even actually winning a single riding. Not good. No system is perfect. The current system has the effect of moderating things. Which is why our country is peaceful and great.	0
LW1, its all about setting boundaries. Years ago, I rented a condo from a 93 year-old landlady who lived next door. While not daily, I was regularly asked to help with this or that. I established that Wednesdays after work were set aside for taking my landlady grocery shopping, dinner out, and any heavy duty chores (a quick vacuum, take out trash). I included her in holiday dinners too, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, etc. She'd treat too, regularly.  9 years later, she retired to a seniors' care facility. We agreed on a price for me to purchase the property. She made all the arrangements through her attorney including holding a note until I could refinance. When it came time for me to sign the papers, I learned that she cut our agreed purchase price in half! She gifted me half the property, worth low six figures. She never mentioned a word, her attorney assured me she was explicitly clear of her decision. Good deeds are rewards in of themselves; sometimes even much more so.	0

Comey's Statement 'Establishes Obstruction Of Justice'	0
For a variety of reasons, I'm a great believer in CBT as treatment for mental disease.  And it's not just a matter of 'belief' - imaging technology developed in the 2000s actually shows brains 'rewiring' themselves when CBT is successful.  Unfortunately, the real issue is that many people are in fact too depressed to believe in or follow through with CBT, which requires the individual's commitment to making the changes to thought patterns and beliefs about themselves.  So I'm not sure how, without support, this online approach might work for these kinds of people.  But perhaps it's a leg up in another way - they don't have to show up for group meetings and work with therapists who they don't feel comfortable with.  Interesting to see where this will go.	0

You're taking a few shortcuts here, is my first thought.  Democracies fall prey to fascism because of corruption and interior rot, and it can't all be laid at the feet of a single political party---Both parties have gamed the system, and all three branches of government are riddled with self-serving douch-bags who only care about the bottom line.    Classist, elitist societies such as ours are the product of corrupt institutions, which  bend the rules in favor of their own.  It's human nature, but that doesn't excuse it.  The end result is that we have a lot of disaffected people, a good many of whom are willing to listen to the snake oil being sold by Trump Inc.  Fascism comes to America wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross, but the door is flung wide open by people like you, among many others, so it's a little late to cry about it now; while incidentally giving Trump just a little more validity in the eyes of his followers.	0
Fishers, mostly men work in a capture industry where what someone else catches is not available to you. The fishers have permits which are very valuable and can be sold even though lobsters are a public resource. The fishers are treated as small businesses but get employment insurance benefits when they do not fish. Greed is the important word here and if lobster was not so expensive few would care. The price of lobster is so high few people who live near the ocean eat it but it is exported to Europe and China. Natives may have fished lobster but only those near the ocean and only when weather and other factors permitted. You need to see fishers in action and how they live to understand the issues. Our supreme court judges often act on ignorance and how they wish to see the world.	0
So, what is your point? Have you seen the writings of those 5th graders in town? Or the high school students who somehow manage to graduate every year without knowing how to spell or do simple math? I think I would be pretty safe in saying that the home-schooled children are capable of much more academically than their public school peers. I know our own kids scored higher than their peers each and every time they were tested. They learned to spell properly, to do simple math equations without calculators and to write cursive. Those were the basics. They went way beyond that.	0

Khadr was never a soldier. He was a guerilla fighter, terrorist, freedom fighter, call him what you like, but he was never a soldier, though he was an enemy of Canada.   He did not fight in a formal fighting unit for a country and does not earn the protections afforded fighting units.  Ergo he found himself in legal limbo.   I don't agree with the torturing that was reported, but that said, denying him his rights kept a known enemy combatant out of Canadian territory.      What he did in his free time in American custody was not our problem.	0

The problems will continue to grow and the street homeless death toll climb until we shut down the enablers.	0

A deduction that EVERYONE gets is not a subsidy (like a personal exemption for yourself).  But a deduction that's selective (i.e. some get it and some don't) is a form of backhanded subsidy.  That's because in order to raise the same amount of total revenue, the base rates have to increase as more and more selective deductions are subtracted out of the total.  For you to pay $1000/yr less in taxes because of that mortgage interest deduction, others have to pay $1000 more to make up the difference (via higher rates).  That means the ones paying more because they don't get that mortgage interest deduction are effectively subsidizing the ones that do get it.  Without that deduction, it evens the taxation out to where no one is getting (or paying for) that subsidy.  Making it more fair and equitable taxation.  And that's true for most deductions. Like state/local taxes. Federal taxpayers in low tax states subsidize those in high tax states now via that deduction.	0

"Interesting.   My main concern is that Canada and the provinces make the decision to adopt certain practices based on the province (or the Feds, in some cases such as for diagnostic tests) picking up the tab.   If responsibility for partial payment is passed on to patients, who do not necessarily have the expertise to determine what is most appropriate, then you have a situation where the government has less incentive to play a role in setting guidelines in a way that is optimal for the greater good.  (ie., maintain or even improve effectiveness of treatments)   From a more theoretical perspective, I'm reading ""The Wealth of Nations"" at the moment and Adam Smith makes the point that one of the three roles for government is to provide public institutions and services which are too expensive for individuals to undertake, but would greatly benefit society as a whole.   Both education and health care fit in that category."	0

Tempmoana, it has nothing to do with not listening and everything to do with seeing.  I have listened to many government officials and Democrat politicians and have read many reports of government officials saying they believe Russia interfered in the 2016 election, but not one of them has cited specific evidence to prove it.    I also have read about government officials saying the claim or conclusion that Russia was behind the alleged interference is based in part on the MO or software tools used by hackers, which was similar to that used in other cyberattacks linked to Russia.  Such flakey evidence is being cited to support claims that Russia interfered in the election, but it is not conclusive evidence.  It also has been alleged that two Russian groups suspected of doing the hacking had links to the Russian government, but that is not prove that Putin of the Russian government ordered the interference.  Seeing is believing.  Produce some irrefutable evidence and I will believe it.	0

Your ""good guys with guns"" argument is a little defective.  At Umpqua CC, there was an armed student with a permit to carry, who saw the shooter and DID NOTHING.  Know why?  His statement to the journalist was ""I didn't want to get involved.""  And when the cops in Dallas were being targeted, there were more than 20 guys with side arms.  Know what THEY did? They scrambled and ran and hid, screaming like little girls.  Who do you think you are kidding with this?  MOST people would DO NOTHING, because they would be too busy saving themselves."	0

Here they think that they can do ANYTHING they want because of Communism, Socialism, unions, sex and abortions.  On a radio program a caller told me the one about abortions. I told him about evil doings that do not cancel each other.    Live by the sword -- die by the sword."	0

It seems to me their expectations are a bit too high. If they both retire at 60, they will receive approx. 50k/year in pension income (both of them combined) and will have two properties to carry. They will see a very significant drop in their lifestyle, given that it seems to me that their actual  expenses were somewhat underreported.  As a matter of fact, I would even worry they may not be able to carry the Florida condo on their pension income.    They way I see it, get rid of the Florida condo and streamline your lifestyle or work longer. Their retirement will be relatively comfortable but nowhere near their today's standard.	0
All of these projects may have some long term benefits, however, having so many of these projects in progress at the same time is poor planning.  Due to Alaska's current financial condition we are now stuck with several projects partially completed and unlikely to be completed in the near future.

The whole of Goespel teaching on pharasees makes it pretty clear that we are to treat homosexuals with compassion rather than self-righteousness. Believe them when they say they were born that way and when science confirms this (which it has). Facing the implications of that for our own biases is what the Gospel demands if you take it as a whole.  This is what Jesus meant about the difficulty of entering the kingdom of God and who it is difficult for. Not for the gays (pederastry is a separate case), but for those lacking compassion and perfect love.	0

You can pick the data apart and find the information you want to discredit anything. The fact remains that insurance premiums across the country have increased for health care coverage for well over 20 years.  The increases did not start with the ACA; they were clearly known for the last 20 years.  So believe what ever you wish but it does not change the facts.  Now we listen to more nonsense about how a new Trumpcare plan will reduce cost. What you do not hear is a comparison of what the Donald's plan provides.  I can claim to save you thousands with a policy that covers nothing if that what you are willing to accept.  You'll only get concerned when you are notified that the services you received are not covered by your low cost plan.  Remember the truth about your coverage is right there in what the policy says it provides regardless of what Trump and his GOP friends claim it will do for you. For now, what Trumpcare will cover is a secret known to the 13 holy men in the Senate.	0

The often repeated claim that Republicans had no part in creating the ACA is just false. ACA was based on a plan from the  Heritage Foundation and 188 republican proposed amendments were adopted during a process that took 18 months including numerous hearings. Republicans like to characterize it as a secretive process but it was far from it. Democrats tried to make the bill bipartisan as evidenced by the acceptance of the amendments from those in the minority. However in the end, the bill got not one republican vote followed by 7 years of votes to repeal rather than fix the issues and create a final solution that works for all Americans. The Republican Party has come to symbolize political posturing over substance and with the advent of Donald Trump, party over country. Time for a new party; one focused on solutions for regular people.	0

"You have ""affordable housing"" confused with the projects (what we used to call Section 8, now called ""subsidized housing"").  There are affordable-housing complexes around the country for groups of people.  Most of them are for retired folks, who no longer earn enough to qualify for market-rate housing.  I can assure you, these are not welfare queens!  And, these complexes have very-strict rules regarding maintenance, etc.  They are inspected periodically by representatives of the investors.

First, everyone should know that Saunders flunked out of York University in the 1980s.  He wasn't even smart enough to get a BA at York!  Second, Mounk's latest study has nothing to do with Europe's Jews.  Third, here is the link to Reynie's actual study: www.fondapol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Anti-Semitic-Attitudes-in-France-New-Insights-20151.pdf   As one can see, Saunders has dramatically underplayed Muslim anti-Semitism, as he always does.  Muslim anti-Semitism is monstrous and deadly.  51% of French Muslims are anti-Semites, and that figure rises to 63%!!! among practicing Muslims.  The fact that Saunders advocates flooding Europe with Muslims knowing their murderous anti-Semitism shows that Saunders is an advocate of anti-Semitism himself.  This article is dangerous nonsense, as usual.	0

Very few ever get the second chance he's getting.  Just be quiet, real quiet and win on the field!	0

"Re: small communities. IMHO intentional eucharistic communities by whatever name are one way to go. The limited exposure I have had with IECs has left me with a very favorable impression. The anonymity of large parishes and circuit riding priests, of which I am one, does not seem to ""be working"" all that well. It is almost impossible for a pastor to know so many folks.   When Jesus said ""wherever 2 or more are gathered in my name I am with them"", he said nothing about permission, faculties, gender, sexual orientation, location, etc. Not sure we really absolutely need so many of the huge parish plants.  Although, in some places the family education approach has led to some fairly strange situations. I do not know how to address these, and I'm glad it is not in my lane.  I believe the Spirit is involved in all this through the actual questioning, maybe not in the same old answers."	0

Racism in America can be, and has been resisted and overcame, but the moment we give in to the New World Order, we're finished as a sovereign nation. Trump will pass, and many more presidents will happen. America is much bigger than any one person, or any radical elements that may lift their heads now and then. The KKK, Neo-Nazis, and supremacists have risen and fallen many times already. They will fall again, by their own hatred and violent ways. The South lost the Civil War. Their statues were a remembrance to their loss. They softened the sting. To tear them down, at this late date, is adding insult to injury, and swinging the pendulum too far in one direction. The swing-back, equally as far, was inevitable. Let them have the symbols of their defeat, to sop their sorrows in.	0

I think they should consider the society into which they would move.

Just wait until Trump eliminates the estate tax (in the first quarter), this will create a perpetual ruling class, we can call 'royalty'....and they will live in 'castles'...welcome to the 'American Dream'....	0
Wow...mostly wind.  I think Krugman is a liberal, and there were GOP liberals and progressives, back when they read their bibles. Is he partisan? So what!  I'm sure he has thought about the issues and I appreciate what he's saying...the angry white males voted for people whose policies hurt them. And yes Pres. Bill Clinton, who was the best Republican President since Eisenhower, did some dumb things in the name of deregulation that screwed up banking and helped create the bubble...but so did lines of credit tied to your house and lower taxes on the wealthy.  The lines of credit created another bubble, one that masked the lack of wages, as people spent their equity. You could buy a car by borrowing money on your home... a really stupid idea, and something Krugman warned about. So yes they are angry, yet if they think Trump gives a crap, they are wrong, again. And they will somehow blame me for their stupidity.	1

I recall a story at west Edmonton Mall about a Syrian refugee molesting teenage girls. The recent terrorist attack was a Somali refugee. These are two instances and would not reflect a greater pattern if not for the fact that in certain religions women rights are pitiful. This is not to say that many of these families are fleeing to Canada to escape these problems but it does not mean we should    not report what is politically sensitive. The system breaks down this way. We have a problem with real estate information-that should be an easy fix if not for powerful lobby groups. We have a problem monitoring refugees-that should be an easy fix as well if not for our educational institutions and our MSM refusing to speak truthfully.   The proof is in this publication's decision to disallow discussion on this most recent event. When you hear someone like Carvin take this narrative challenge it. When our MSM does not allow public discussion take it to the streets-lawfully.	0

Honestly the handicapped parking should probably be eliminated or changed drastically.  At the current time you can go to any mall around the busy time of the year and often find zero places for parking except the disabled parking which will often been only 10% filled.  And even then the odds are the people using those spots aren't really disabled... but we put disabled parking close to the doors which is frankly stupid.  Just mandate all parking spaces be made large enough for wheelchair accessibility and there is no need for special parking period... remember the disabled always like to claim they want to be treated just like everyone else.... Well most of the time everyone else has to walk further than 20 feet to get to a entrance no reason someone in a wheelchair can't drive themselves further like the rest of us and when there is no benefit from the handicap parking there will be no one trying to game the system.	0
"This is from the on-line etymological dictionary: ""mystery (n.1) early 14c., in a theological sense, ""religious truth via divine revelation, hidden spiritual significance, mystical truth,"" from Anglo-French *misterie, Old French mistere ""secret, mystery, hidden meaning"" (Modern French mystère), from Latin mysterium ""secret rite, secret worship; a secret thing,"" from Greek mysterion (usually in plural mysteria) ""secret rite or doctrine,"" from mystes ""one who has been initiated,"" from myein ""to close, shut"" (see mute (adj.)); perhaps referring to the lips (in secrecy) or to the eyes (only initiates were allowed to see the sacred rites).""

Even If its 5 minutes but you are making a decision that unfailry helps your bank with TOD Its not right! If you are lobbying for territorial on the tax payers dime for 1 minute it is wrong!

"You say ""so what?"".  Good for you. That is your prerogative.  I would appreciate your views on Muslim nations that exist today. Which could you live in comfortably? Probably the majority choice would be Turkey, but as it slides towards dictatorship (again), perhaps soon that one almost tolerable Muslim nation will join its fellow Muslim states as a  cesspool of intolerance and medieval practices. Of course, you would say that this is the west's fault.  Yes, so what? So what if nations that have achieved the greatest living standards and the highest levels of liberty in human history sink back into the dark ages.  So what indeed."	0

Hmmm.  I'm not unconscious when I shop for health insurance every year.  I'm not unconscious when I go to the doctor for my annual exam.  I was unconscious when I had my appendix removed but I spoke for myself both before and after.  As such I am fully capable of making my own decisions about healthcare just as I make my own decisions about what food to eat, where to live, what transportation to take, etc., etc., etc.  That's because I'm a fully functioning adult, not a child who needs the government to make my decisions for me.

It is pretty clear what side you are on, and it is the losing one. This Ammon Bundy is the same idiot who complained that his trial was taking too long to go to court and now wants delays?

The feds didn't need to do anything but watch.

How many government employees get a pension of 80K, GIP?  70% is the max, meaning the worker would have had to have an average salary of 115.  Few government jobs pay that well.  And 10K invested at age 20 with 10K per year added at only 5% return results in a nest egg of over 1M at age 55.  Not that hard to achieve for a disciplined saver -- and a government worker earning 115K contributes more than 10K a year to his or her pension.  Get your arithmetic straight and you, too, can have a comfortable retirement.	0

"The guides should know better than to battle a salmon like it was a marlin but no doubt they cave it to what their clients think sport fshing is.  I do very little combat fishing but when I do I teach the people I bring with me is that the goal of catching a fish on a line is to get it in and keep it in front of you while doing it.  Fishing at the Homer Spit Fishing Hole for years there is nothing more annoying than to have an angler hook a salmon and ""walk"" it sideways back and forth on the bank irritating other people fishing as they take ""forever"" to reel it in. Most of the cause of that is inexperience, poor technique and gear that does not work for the species of fish they are seeking or gear, line that is just worn out. There is a lot more to sport fishing than to toss a line into the water."	0

The Trump years are a waste of four years. Trump is not great. What is notable with Trump is he is a incessant liar and not particularly competent. Mexico is not paying for his wall. And his failure to come up with a viable alternative to Obamacare was a reflection of his lack of knowledge and leadership on policy matters. Ryan and McConnell wrote the legislation behind closed doors rather than holding open Congressional hearings. Trump was wasting his time golfing and watching television since it was an embarrassment for him to talk publicly or privately about the subject given how stupid he is. Trump bought his college degree. He did not earn it.   Trump is not inspirational and lacks legitimacy. Most of his opinions are driven from his racist point of view that blames immigrants, blacks, and Mexicans as the source of all troubles. So it is not surprising that he supports the Klan and its attempts to rename itself as the alt-right. And he failed to win the popular vote.	1

Real estate has accounted for 40% of recent GDP growth.  What will Trudeau do if this slowdown in sales becomes a longer and broader trend, and results in an abrupt shortfall in expected government revenues?  Let the deficit go to 50+ Billion?

"Erring on the side of caution when it comes to abortion, to me means letting the mother decide. I wouldn't enforce ""society's"" dictates on the mother and/or the fetus on this issue. That would be wrong. As to a fetus being human, I don't quite agree. There is certainly a threshold when crossed, the fetus is human. However, there is also a point where we have only a zygote; a dividing cell that continues the dividing and differentiating process. I consider this to have the potential to be human but no more human than an acorn is an oak tree. As to the ending of life at both ends of the age spectrum, with some limitations, I support it. There comes a time in the process of aging, when nothing works right any more, the body aches, and there doesn't appear to be any reason to prolong avoiding the inevitable. Therefore, the aged should have the means to end their own lives in a humane, comfortable, and assured way...with safeguards against murder in place."	0

"In Lane County, the National Forests are about the same acreage as the industrial corporate timberland.

I've never heard anyone say ""all"" of the old growth has been logged.  Most of it, yes.  Oregon's coast range might have a percent or two left, but most is in tiny disconnected segments.

"Truth be told no one wants to wade into the swamp of political incorrectness and recognize the changes and adjustments that have been tried to save the open space located in the heart of downtown. 1) The definition of ""downtown"" is an area comprising the central commerce district.  2) Loitering in ""downtown"" is not appropriate. The City has removed sitting areas from the center of ""downtown"" to try to eliminate loitering. The city provides parks and benches for resting a short distance to the east. There is open space in the park blocks for concerts and gatherings that is equal to or has greater square footage available.  3) By returning the square to it's intended use as defined by the term ""downtown"" ...does NOT mean Eugene is uncaring or should feel guilt. Even Eugene, as liberal a community as it may be, has it's limits. Those who loiter and gather there, have laid claim to the square and there is nothing the City can do, other then eliminating the square, that will change that."	0

News stories are supposed to be factual, and, in the main, they are.  What I object to is that sometimes the choice of words, (not to mention the headlines) reveals not so much a personal bias as the journalist's lack of experience or ability. Choice of words (and on TV, body language and tone of voice) is often needlessly inflammatory, but it sells--always has. But it's not a conspiracy."	0

And their programs being socialist systems is the exact reason why it will never work in the states. A socialist program can not be squashed into a very heavily profited capitalist system.

Long past time to end the terrorist tyranny of religion over all of the populace.  The anti-human dissenting votes reflect the failure of the CONservative justices to live up to their oaths to defend the Constitution.  A Constitution providing the basis for all human rights and not a vehicle for denying legal, secular rights by religious fanatics.  These continuing claims by religious fanatics are a waste of governing time to elevate religious institutions over all other humans' rights.  Time to wipe out all religious privilege in taxation and within the economy.  Religious businesses need to pay their share of taxes.  Religious leaders need to be prosecuted for political campaigning from the pulpit or lose all tax exemptions including church and manse.  The Constitution is a secular document.  Human rights must not be restricted by insane religious creeds left over from the Dark Ages.	0

Layla4: I believe you're correct about this. I had a comment deleted that I posted yesterday on another article where I merely said I'd like to know whether the author of M-103 subscribes to the Western concept of human rights or to the Islamic concept, the latter of which is embodied in the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam to which I believe more than 40 Muslim-majority countries are signatories. The CDHRI was developed as an oppositional response to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which prevails in the West and much of the rest of the non-Muslim world. To me, it doesn't seem unreasonable or disrespectful to ask our politicians about their beliefs when they're telling us what we can, should or must believe. But apparently my preference for transparency isn't shared by all. Is preemptive censorship the new standard of tolerance in 21st century Canada?	0
"Licensing - by itself - accomplishes nothing.  It needs to be accompanied by EDUCATION; most bicyclists have no idea that they are a vehicle and need, on the whole, to behave like one.    Yes, as with autos, there will always be yahoos who don't think the rules apply to them - riding on crosswalks, going the wrong way down one-way streets, blowing through red lights, failing to signal, etc.   But I believe the majority of riders want to do the right thing ... but have no idea what that is.    Provide educational material (or maybe a half-hour ""course"") as part of every license or renewal.  Charge $5 or $10 a year (to pay for the license, but also as a contribution to the upkeep of biking infrastructure).  In exchange, maintain a database of bike VIN-type registration numbers, so that recovered stolen bikes can easily be returned to their owners.

I hated forced union membership the entire time . When I started by biggest beef was they always protected the slackers who deserved to be fired. Still , dues were a fair monthly amount.  By the time I left they still protected the slackers , yet often lost---and the dues became an outrageous ripoff .  Workers were having to give unions thousands a year with no benefits other than them working with the other unions every few years on contracts.  Every employee that could , was thrilled to get out of the union and still looks at them as a ripoff. I did more for the unions than they ever did for me. Again , union membership is in decline in America. That ought to tell you something.  There are countless millions who feel just like me. Workers can give themselves pay raises by dumping unions and taking home the full amount they earned and deserve .	0

Truck drivers are not subject to random roadside screening, nor are they subject to random testing ONLY if they cross the US border.

This so typical of government---jump on a nutty left wing scam that feels good. Can anyone actually show evidence that man's CO2 is causing serious global warming? Do these clowns even know that: Fact:  Man only emits about 5% of the annual CO2 emissions, the rest is from nature. Fact:  Water vapor causes most of the greenhouse effect Fact: CO2 only causes20-30% of warming. Fact:  The rate of the current warming is statistically indistinguishable from earlier warm periods. Fact:  In most studies CO2 follows temperature, not leads it (a cause cannot follow the effect) Fact:  Minoan, Egyptian, Roman and Medieval times were warmer than recently. Fact:  Glaciers retreated FASTER in the 1930s than recently Fact:  Ocean rise is within historical norms. Fact:  Solar cycles are a better fit to climate than CO2. evidence: http://www.debunkingclimate.com/climatefacts.html Sierra Club Leader Explains the Evidence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCXwF39enc	0

It is frivolous.   It is not possible to comply with the law for long term projects.   Lawyers and justices don't know anything about construction and are just blindly following their own interpretation of unreasonable law. Justices are so way off from the real world that the legislature discussed clarifying the law related to burials to make it comply which generally accepted practice.   This is what happens when legislators who are lawyers make a law which cannot be follow. Yes it is frivolous.	0

Objective economic reality isn't affected by our emotions. The motel owner can either leave things as they are and continue to lose money, in which case the motel will eventually go bankrupt and close, or he can fix the problems and charge more, in order to pay for the repairs and fumigation, then have conditions be better. The motel guests also have options - they can work, find better jobs that pay more the minimum wage, and/or get a second job. Those aren't great options, but most people are in the financial situation they put themselves in for a variety of reasons. I used to work 3 jobs, to support my family, and was forward-thinking enough to realize that wasn't a good long-term plan. The example of the couple who stayed there 15 years is a good indicator of really poor planning.	0
"A State lawyer who tells a Governor, or sometimes even a commissioner, something s/he doesn't want to hear puts his/her career on the line.   As a general matter, the formal, publicly expressed, opinion of the Attorney General or his/her Assistants is what the Governor wants it to be.   I'm not an advocate of an elected and thus independent, sorta', AG, but I do believe the State needs a Solicitor General who serves for a prescribed term and is only removable for cause to represent the State or challenge the State in litigation without political interference.   I've framed lots of conversations with State lawyers with, ""I didn't call you to ask you what to do, I called you to tell you what I was going to do and ask you how to make it legal.

If rail is the solution to jobs and economy, then when the rail is finished do we come up with another billion dollar project?  Seriously, we would have been better off just giving these workers the same amount of money they were paid in welfare than draining the tax payers with this reckless blank check spending. What you're talking about of using tax payers' hard earned money and having a smaller fraction dished out to construction workers as a solution to jobs or economy or Makes no sense.  Imagine if we took like half of the cost of the rail and put it toward construction of affordable housing and/or public housing.  Could you imagine how much that would help people, both homeless and those needing affordable housing?  You would get the construction jobs and pay and also give them a place for them and their families to live in rather than building a rail no one uses or can find while laundering public money into private and call it a good thing for construction workers.	0

Frazer, I agree with you.  But I would like to see them lift the ban for commercial fishermen in the monument.  Keep the monument intact but open it up to Hawaii's fishery, that includes longlining, trolling and bottom fishing.  Compared to many foreign fisheries, Hawaii is one of the most documented and researched fisheries in the world.  What many don't know is there are likely illegal foreign boats fishing there now that go unreported or unregulated.  While a majority think it's easy for our longliners to simply move grounds, fishing doesn't work that way.  Our local supply drops, seafood wholesalers are forced to bring in inferior foreign product with little to no health regulations.  Example: hep A tainted scallops from the PI.  It will get supplemented from elsewhere.     Longlining doesn't affect corals and they have very minimal by catch interactions.  The idea of MPAs does sound good but there is no hard scientific evidence that proves these monuments work.	0

I can't disagree.    I sample all the local news stations and their national versions as well on an irregular basis.  Covering exactly the same story can result in such different 'news'.

They relive their experiences and suffer the effects of them (physical abuse and alcoholism, lack of motivation) DAILY. They CANNOT ""move forward"" as you and I might.  2. Worse, the cycle is perpetuated through their children, who grow up in these disfunctional environments.   3.  Too many FN leaders don't ""lead"" --they TAKE, leaving their people in poverty.

Should we congratulate them on being born early enough to make that fortune?  Because if they're buying today (or recently) in some parts of Canada (Lower Mainland+Victoria, perhaps GTA+Hamilton), the fortune they'll make in rent is going to still be smaller than the fortune they'll have in carrying costs on their purchase.  It is a too-common misconception, especially among some misinformed buyers, that renters absolutely have to cover all of an owner's costs. They don't. Renters pay what the renal market will bear. Some people in Vancouver rent at a loss, counting on price appreciation to be far greater than the near-term loss. Some don't realize this, over-ask for rent, and then slowly cut the price over (vacant) months until they touch market values.	0

I also spent time educating myself so I could be the advocate my kid deserved. Charging lawyer rates for navigation services seems a bit rich. As usual, those without cash get left out.  For more complicated health issues, here's what you should know:  1) Academically affiliated health centres are the gold standard (they don't refer to them as tertiary care centres for nothing) 2) Find a physician who is affiliated with a teaching hospital (where more than 1 doc reviews your case and medical decisions are collaborative) On the other hand, if you've broken a bone, or have non urgent (not life threatening) concerns, your local hospital or walk-in clinic should suffice."	0

An interesting read. Banishment has been a practice for centauries. And it is alive and well today. The GOP seem to have a list of them. From Trumps Banish all Muslims, when they try to come here. To their other little hatreds Abortion and Gays. If they could banish those so afflicted they would be so happy. But Paul did not forget his biggest wish. To banish the Democrats. Obviously he has issues that he really needs to deal with	0

Not a particularly good week for President Trump. With the rollout of his divisive travel ban already challenged by a Hawaii federal court, his replacement for Obamacare on life-support, and these remarkably mean-spirited Twitter posts receiving near universal rebuke the July 4th weekend should come as a welcome respite. Time to return to Mar-a-Lago where he can harangue his retinue and seek sympathy from his fellow out of touch millionaires. There at least he can be a legend in his own mind.	0

A better use for tax dollars would have been to create micro-loans for small businesses, which are the major source of job creation. The million + $ down this rat-hole would have helped a lot more entrepreneurs get up and running. This boondoggle has created, what, ONE job so far, other than some highly paid executive positions.

I am so proud of Vani Hari for bringing the fact of GMOs to folks attention. They are not the same as conventional food: they are patented to be different.  GMO marketers are covertly slipping them into food, and that is unethical. We have a right to know what we eat. I am a science teacher and unlabeled, untracked food experiments on the population, with foods designed to deliver pesticides, is unethical and criminal. But this adulteration of food is nothing new. It has been going on since Roman times. Just different players.

"Let's refer to the Bill of Rights, first amendment, shall we? Here's the text: ""That government is instituted, and ought to be exercised for the benefit of the people; which consists in the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right of acquiring and using property, and generally of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.""  You and I obviously disagree on abortion. I'm guessing you believe that abortion is wrong, period. You might be surprised to realize that many of us protesting for the right of a woman to choose abortion don't *like* abortion. Choosing to end a pregnancy is often a terrible, hard choice. What we want is the right to make that hard choice. Why do we believe it's important? Because we believe that women have the right to determine when, how, and if they get pregnant — that such a right is fundamental to our life, liberty, happiness, and safety. We fought for and won that right, and we now stand up for it."	0

Paulson is still spouting the longtime GOP Reaganesque policy of cutting social security and medicare while the 1% pay less in taxes than ever in the past, in no small part thanks to the Bush presidencies, notably Dubya.  Supply side economics has been proven not to work multiple times and yet is still espoused by the GOP  old guard.  We need to take banking back to simpler times when they couldn't speculate with depositors' savings, didn't sell stocks and bonds, or insurance; had to live with strict usury laws and corporate campaign funding was illegal.  A lot of corrective action by the Fed concerning evasive corporate structuring in order to resist compliance with the quick and orderly breakup regs is needed instead of Yellin's milquetoast approach. Paulson and company need to man up and acknowledge the part they and Dubya took in starting the two longest and most expensive wars in American history and bankrupting the country in the process.

And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same.'""  Where are the Trump apologists who have been dripping scorn on us for calling Trump a racist?

The tone of this article clearly celebrates these scofflaws as noble and moral. These people broke our laws to take advantage of opportunities that are reserved for citizens and legal immigrants.

The private sector has had plenty of time to fix the healthcare crisis in the US, starting with the 1992 election when it became a big issue. Nothing changed at all. Obama ran in 2008 on a mandate to fix the issue, because the private sector simply couldn't fix it. If they could've done so they would have done it in 1992. They have run out of time and excuses. Trump has no plan that differs from Obama's. It will likely be a variation on the ACA, but then he'll claim its some radically new thing.	0

Mr Saganash, your article does a great disservice to the people you claim to care about. You are a representative of the FN, but you come across as a complainer, with a negative attitude, and a huge sense of entitlement, gloom and doom, seeing problems everywhere and coming with no solution.

I'm no expert on finance. But I have watched the Murkowski, Palin and Parnell (Republican all) administrations do insane things similar to the current crew in Juneau and the current crew were most all players supporting these failed governors and their failed policies.   You don't hear the term so much any more but I think it still applies; CBC, the Corrupt Bastards Club. I think TED Stevens (R) coined it. It was often used to describe the long list of Republicans who really were corrupt, took bribes, etc. and ended up in jail but was used by many Republicans, jokingly, to refer to themselves. Except it wasn't funny then and it still isn't.   Unless Alaskans miraculously quit voting like drones for a stupid party label instead of for what a candidate stands for there will be no positive change. But there is hope. Governor Walker is not one of  charter members of the CBC. He just needs some legislators who aren't either to work with.  Vote smart Alaskans.	1

"Regarding: ""The diocese also decried those who leaked the communication. ""Those who place at risk the ability of the bishop to communicate with his priests confidentially do a grave harm to the Church and perform, indeed, what Sacred Scripture calls 'a work of darkness,' "" King said."" - Nuts. - If this communication is an example for what episcopal secrecy is required then it is time that the laity explain the facts of what 'church' is, and what 'pastor' means. - In short this validates again that that which is uttered behind closed doors, or written for eyes only does no good for the People of God."	0

If Balkisoon digs deep enough in her own personal history she's also find some of her ancestors were also responsible for some sin or act of oppression against another group.  I don't think anyone can honestly say their lineage is completely void of controversy.  We should primarily look back at history to consider options so the same mistakes aren't made.   Human interaction always has benefits and detriments. We've got a tremendous problem in Canada as we're still being held ransom by FN groups for things done to them hundreds of years ago without even considering the net benefits of being lifted out of the equivalent of the stone-age.

If you look at it. We are like almost every other industrialized nation with regard to mental health and most every issue, except for one.  The astronomical amount of guns versus population.

It is plain & simply the amount of guns in our country.   4% of the world population with 42% of the guns and people entrenched that having innocent kids, our brothers and sisters in Christ slaughtered is an acceptable price to pay.  Of course we all end up paying for this. Society pays dearly.	0

"The bridge had just been resurfaced in Autumn 2013 during a prolonged trail repair closure. If the problem was so apparent, why was the bridge left in place? I'm sure the bridge was decayed, but would not characterize failure under a 7-ton load as ""sudden collapse.""  I should add that the decay was likely increased by the ""repaired"" replacement surface, which is a synthetic material with gaps below.

Well, given the fact that you refuse to accept any source that doesn't agree with you as credible, I've been reviewing the 2014 IPCC report looking for their estimate of the cost of fighting global warming, and can't seem to find one.  Maybe you can point one out to me.  https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains5-7.html  But I owe you an apology.  I was dealing in hypotheticals.  The fight against Global Warming isn't going to cost us anything, because we aren't going to fight it.  We've pulled out of the Paris Accords and we're reigning in the EPA's excessive regulations.  Trump called it a hoax, and apparently the voters agreed.  Sorry you couldn't make the sale.  Better luck next time.  Meanwhile, you might want to think about preparing for colder weather.

"Yes, the individual mandate is necessary for risk pools - not just for the old but those with pre-existing conditions and the unhealthy. It is irresponsible if you don't have insurance. Your interpretation is simplistic and inaccurate. Young people do not ""pay"" for the old and sick, they pay for insurance. The ""old and sick"" have Medicare.  I am healthier, have a better diet and more active, as an life long athlete at 61, than most young people.  To equate young and healthy is completely inaccurate in this country. You know obesity is an epidemic, right? Rates of colon cancer is rising fastest in young people (30's). They get sick. There is an attitude among young people that they don't need health care, when they do. It costs taxpayers when people go to the emergency room and/or  are unable to pay for the care they receive. It was this attitude I was addressing. The ACA does need to be fixed.  Republicans did undermine some key provisions in the law (before they voted against it)."	0

My dad worked two jobs most of his life. One of them was as pianist in dance bands. He drove an hour to and from Peebles Hydro in Scotland on Friday and Saturday nights, and got back home around 4am.

"Well this is a positive step, although not perhaps for the Russian wing of the administration.   But the plot thickens.   Ezra Cohen-Watnick's wife Becky did public relations for the Russian government and then there is Carter Page (aka Male 1, to the FBI) who communicated with a Russian spy in 2013, claiming the documents he provided were innocuous.  FBI ""transcripts from 2013 of wiretapped conversations among the Russians discussing their efforts to recruit Male 1, identified as a New York energy trader whom the Russians described as willing to talk."" The spy was subsequently convicted.   So pull up a seat, get yourself some popcorn, and stay tuned as the story continues. And beware of trolls. They should be arriving shortly."	0

You're assuming that the amount of short wave radiation coming in is constant.  It isn't.  The Earth receives variable amounts of radiation coming in, not only from the sun, but from other stars.  And what we receive from the sun varies with sunspot activity, which has far more influence on climate change than the composition of greenhouse gases, documentable by historic correlations between temperature and sunspot activity that are far more direct and consistent than the correlation with CO2 concentration.  And that's a scientific fact.  Other important variables include our position relative to the sun in our ever-changing elliptical orbit and the ever-changing tilt of the Earth's axis, which might explain why it may be warmer now in the Northern hemispere where you gather most of the data, and cooler in the Southern hemisphere where you gather very little.  It doesn't serve the agenda to get an actual average global temperature, so you cheat. (cont'd)	0

Kagan isn't over the top at all.  There is no precedent in American history for the election of a man like Trump to the presidency--none.  The closest would be Andrew Jackson in 1828, who members of the political establishment of his time believed wanted to make himself another Bonaparte.  But Jackson had by then served for almost 30 years as soldier, diplomat, senator, and political boss of the Tennessean machine.  In short, he was a sophisticated public player compared to the bankrupt gambler and celebrity Trump.  Make no mistake, boys: this is the Rubicon. Trump is not another Goldwater, not even another Wallace or Huey Long.   Let him become president, and you can put your head been your legs and kiss your republic goodbye.	0

No it won't.  Majority governments are certainly still possible under the proportional system. How is the current FPTP  system democratic where 61-65 % of the electorate has virtually no governing voice in the their country after an election?

Actually the courts have allowed for the use of National Guard as long as they are funded by the State and not the Federal Government thus avoiding the the issue of the federal government using federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States. Posse Comitatus only specifically applies to the United States Army and, as amended in 1956, the United States Air Force. While the Act does not explicitly mention the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, the Department of the Navy has prescribed regulations that are generally construed to give the Act force with respect to those services as well. The Act does not apply to the National Guard under state authority from acting in a law enforcement capacity within its home state or in an adjacent state if invited by that state's governor.	0

They are NOT allowed to move you to FIRST class. The policy at most if not all major airlines is simple: upgrades to Business or First Class may only be accomplished if and when the passenger has paid the full-fare price for the upgrade or in exchange for previously accrued and still valid air miles earned in the company's own frequent flyer program. No other upgrade path is available, no exceptions, not even once in the air. The flight crew is permitted to allow you to move within the seats allocated to the fare class you paid so they will allow you to go to another free seat within the same fare class you booked in but don't think for a second they'll ever upgrade anyone from coach to first class for free even if there are plenty of empty seats in first class as they would face termination of employment if caught.	0

Obamacare is not the subject.  OK, I'll grant you that the Dems under Pelosi were largely ineffective.

It is true that housing affordability (compared to income) is generally worse now, but it is also true that those starting out today have much bigger expectations for what and where their first house will be, and the general standards of living (especially) when starting out are luxury compared to what it was then.  Expectations are much higher now than they were 15-20-30-40 years ago.  I suspect t a big  part of the currrent cost pressures are somewhat  self inflicted by these increased expectations.	0

Oh, “BIGOTRY!” Homosexual acts are sinful, and, according to Sacred Scripture, one of the four sins “crying to heaven for vengeance.”  A gay marriage is (un)naturally going to involve said acts.  Are you capable of comprehending this?  The baker doesn’t want to participate in a wedding that promotes this sin.  Now, a bigot is “a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; [you certainly fit that description to a tee] especially :one who regards or treats the members of a group (such as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance.” The question boils down to obstinacy and intolerance.  Well, when bases his opinion or belief of something as crystal clear as”homosexual behavior is sinful”, is it obstinacy or principled dissent?  And why do you think we should be tolerant of sin?  That certainly isn’t Christ-like, being as that Christ admonished everyone to “sin no more.”  You are the obstinate bigot here, clearly.	1

First of all, those services are not free and we in general aviation pay our fair share through aviation fuel taxes, which is the most cost effective way to collect money to pay for the system. Second, the proposal that has been put forward is the same one that has been put forward for the last decade, which is dominated by the airlines. Yes, they would love to eliminate the cost of supporting the air traffic system. Which is primarily for their benefit. The major issue is that every country that has followed this path has destroyed their general aviation segment. The reason that the airline would love this is that they could increase their profits through eliminating the cost of supporting the FAA system that was developed for their benefit. They would also love to eliminate the competition from general aviation so they can control all air transportation.	0

"""Theology is not about angels dancing in pinheads ...""  True. On the other hand, plenty of pinheads study theology. I know because I've often been accused of being one. 😉  I won't get down in the weeds on your conversation with LG, but I will observe that in the time frame you're discussing (between the Apostolic Age and Trent) there were 18 ecumenical councils, and nearly all of them were called in response to some sort of crisis of either theology or politics -- or both.  This was the era of local churches going decades without the benefit of communion with other local churches or the Church Universal. Considering the circumstances, the wonder is that there wasn't more divergence on theological development than there actually was -- which, logic says, must have been plenty.  Thus the need for the councils in the first place."	0
"Institutionalised racism has created the concept of  ""Us""and ""them"" throughout history of South Africa, which culminated and was re-inforced by apartheid. How and can we get over it ? My personal feeling is that we cannot, whether is is white on black, or black on white, whilst we continue to official define people based on race at birth, there will be an awareness of race, a grouping based on race and therefore racism will always be present. Human nature is such, if you are having difficulty in succeeding, blame it on somebody else, whether it is a white guy who says he can't get a job due to EE employment or a black guy who says he can't get an executive position because of white executive control."	0

"“We should not change tax regimes willy-nilly.”  Rep. Lynn Gattis, you are entirely correct.  Legislation of any kind should not change just because there is a new governor but should be established by intelligent, fair decision originally.  A decision which is fair and impartial of political donations and backroom dealings.  Yes, government should encourage industry but government should not ""pay"" industry!  A question, who is Brad Keithley and who 'gave' him the $100,000 to spend attacking the oil industry and the legislature?  Doubtful it was from his own pocket.  My point that ""paid"" lobbying either for or against something in government should be illegal because with big money from mysterious sources comes big corruption.  Just saying, that corruption comes from all sides!"	0
Crimea has been Russian since WW II when Josef Stalin deported Crimean families, manyof whom were Tatars, to Central Asia and replaced the population with Russians. In my opinion that is a done deal like the North America genocide of Native Americans by Europeans, the genocide of Armenians by Turks, and many other genocides. Crimea, owing to its location on a major trade route, has been overrun time and again by armies of various peoples. Ukraine is a horse of a different color. It's language is separated from Russian by 3 - 4 centuries. Lenin's armies took it over by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in one of his pogroms. That's history, friend.

We'll just be a bigger version of the villages we're denigrating here.	0

""", 'I wonder what the minimum knowledge necessary for salvation is.' ""  The minimum knowledge for salvation is all you can comprehend in any given situation. With the understanding that you will be held accountable to the ""full extent of the law"", and thus, a true believer has a ""safety net"", namely, the person of Christ. Or, as EGW has well said, ""When we do our best, He becomes our righteousness.""  Equality to God is the ultimate accountability. Thus, a believer defends the divinity of Christ of who equal to God. We approach God by way of Christ and ""do our best"" on a relative and moral level.  So, we have a 100% commitment to be 100% committed to God and Christ. If we work on this principle with an honest intention, we will pass the final judgment with flying colors.  Any theory that undermines this principle is of the devil. And in the end, we have fear and assurance coupled together as the true motive to be a Christian and obtain a fitness for heaven. Christ is our title."	0
BC should look into banning anti-rental clauses in the province's thousands of Strata covenants.  Many many building disallow owners from renting their condos.  In my dad's downtown building, there allow only 6 units to be rented out of 200 condos there.  So many of them go empty!

Ain't happening.     The experts predicted it wouldn't happen due to NK's view that nukes and only nukes ensure survival of the regime.

Then how is it, that in the first three centuries of Christianity's existence that the Eucharist was celebrated in Home Liturgies and that more often than not, had a female presbyter.  Afterward, the Christians gathered also ate dinner together---prepared often by the presbyter---a woman of the household.  It was only after Christianity became accepted and later became THE state religion, that churches were built and the presbyter became priests and all male.  This is the early history of the Church, which the hierarchy won't honestly discuss with people [or admit].  If they did, they could not continue to insist that males only can preside at the Mass.   Jesus ordained NOBODY.  Nowhere is it written that Jesus anointed anyone---never mind just men.  No where in the Gospels, does it state that Jesus gave the Twelve the mission to celebrate the Eucharist.  Rather they were to preach the Gospels and baptize all nations.

The Clintons by their actions have proven beyond any reasonable doubt they are caring people who are willing to help everyone who needs help and Represent ALL the people, not just the RACIST whites."	0

I was one of the 400,000 people who attended the Canada Day 150 Party in Ottawa, in the line up as they stopped letting people in at around 20,000 people. It was a complete waste of time, my money and tax payers money. I learned the next day in the Globe that the venue only holds 32,000 people at the most. It was a political event for the Trudeau's, one I hope everybody in line remembers, for the next election. People from BC, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, many new Canadians with kids in tow. There was nothing in the line, no garbage cams, no food, no monitoring or support, not even a Birthday Cake.   None of the promises' were fulfilled. So long Trudeau, and to rub salt into the wound he talked for 12 minutes, Charlie was only speaking for 3 and the best CF18 we could get in the air was one, just shows the Governments' priority.

"I think you're correct because it obviously cuts both ways, i.e. Chinatowns / Little Norways in the demographic sense, diversity ""celebration"" in the social sense.  As many have said, there is also a general lament that we have lost the commonality of being Americans first and ethnic second.  I would suggest this only invites further stereotyping (call it racism, whatever) whether it be regarding the Samoan car thugs story here, the ""press 1 for English 2 for Spanish"" thing (where's the press 3 for Yupik, 4 for Italian?), BLM in the inner city, and so on.

Is there a reason the city can't pay the general contractor sooner? I'm all for the minority owned business being paid but by forcing the general to essentially finance the construction project. The City is pushing out the mid-level GC ensuring only the mega corps, which have headquarters out of state, are left to build the work.

It is a consensual crime, unlike all the other crimes you mentioned.   I see zero difference between the marijuana issue myself, it's the same thing, all parties involved in the ""crime"" consent to it.  When prostitution is above ground as in rural Nevada, Amsterdam and elsewhere, all these problems that you think are inherent to the industry magically disappear.  Violence and exploitation are inherent to all black markets not to a specific industry.

"Potter broke the most sacred rule of modern academia when he wrote an article that didn't take into account:  ""it's 2017"".

Universities are no longer institutions of free thought - free speech is only encouraged if it falls into the narrow range of ""accepted"" opinions where political correctness is paramount above all else - especially common sense and reality.

Everything you say is absolutely correct. But they are going to ram this reprehensible, morally repugnant gift to the 1% down our throats, even when it results in many thousands of Americans dying.

Indeed, the Church respects life from conception to natural death!  And it respects the rights of children to live through years of abuse at the hands of clergy while it protects the clergy.  See, no one died, except those who committed suicide after having their live destroyed by the clergy, and that was not a natural death, so they don't count in the eyes of the Church.

"Most experts blame Japan's hikikimori crisis on Japan's employment woes, not ""girlfriend software"". I'll try to summarize... Japan traditionally viewed education as guaranteeing a job, and jobs as very secure (e.g. you have a job for life). Due to Japan's stagflation, many youths saw their parents laid off, or themselves were unable to find a job. However the traditional expectations on them did not change. Japanese youths became disenfranchised with a system that pushes them along the same old academic path despite reduced job prospects at the end, and expectations that blame them for the greater economy's woes. Those unmeetable expectations extend into relationships.  tldr; bad ecomony -> no job; no job -> no date; no job + no date -> give up"	0

Thank you for a thoughtful presentation of a global issue that should concern everyone on this planet. I am engaged this very day in Geneva with Governments, business and labour; there is complete agreement that the problems associated with refugees are complex, but urgent.

The simple solution would have been to let them disembark. Then go through costume and provided buses for a trip o Montreal (2hrs). But that would mean Air Transat Had to spent some extra money. Those cheapskates would not consider that. Now they are weaseling out with any excuse they can think of. Another alternative would have been to have them disembark and cleared through costume and then continue with their flight hours later to Montreal.Again that would have meant extra money to them.

Anybody here remember the sponsorship scandal? I guess not.   I don't think it's possible to gather up enough grey matter out of every Liberal supporter in Canada to make one functioning human brain. The previous post proves it.	0

"whatsyourimpact.org.  ""Apart from being created by human activities, carbon dioxide is also released into the atmosphere by natural processes. The Earth's oceans, soil, plants, animals and volcanoes are all natural sources of carbon dioxide emissions.  Human sources of carbon dioxide are much smaller than natural emissions but they upset the balance in the carbon cycle that existed before the Industrial Revolution. The amount of carbon dioxide produced by natural sources is completely offset by natural carbon sinks and has been for thousands of years. Before the influence of humans, carbon dioxide levels were quite steady because of this natural balance.4  42.84 percent of all naturally produced carbon dioxide emissions come from ocean-atmosphere exchange. Other important natural sources include plant and animal respiration (28.56%) as well as soil respiration and decomposition (28.56%). A minor amount is also created by volcanic eruptions (0.03%).""

Joe they do a multitude of mental health/psychiatric type tests including in person interviews with a mental health professional and written tests.  They've done so for years as I had to do them in the early/mid 90's when I became a cop.  They also talk to previous employers, friends, applicants former teachers, parents, etc.  Additionally they do polygraphs/voice stress analysis tests on each applicant.  It is incredibly in depth and many wash out.  Later in my cop career I was one of those people who were conducting the background checks and doing the voice stress tests.	0

Chinese in BC in particular are frequently very insular and elect not to learn English.  Why live in Canada when you can continue to speak Mandarin or Cantonese, shop at exclusively Chinese stores staffed by Chinese employees, cook only Chinese food, watch and read Chinese media (funded by the Canadian taxpayer), and neglect to take part in larger society? Until they need health care, that is, then Mandarin-speaking workers are needed to translate!   In addition, many of this persuasion look down on white Canadians as inferior (as well as people of other ethnicities and races), and non-Chinese people who have walked into Richmond Chinese businesses find quite often that they receive inferior treatment compared to Chinese patrons. One feels a foreigner in one's own country.  Now why would it be improper to speak about this? I don't care how much money you have, or taxes you pay, you ain't no Canadian if that is how you live.

Was trying to find budget figures to understand how much support and funding currently goes to the DOE. https://budget.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FB-17-19-BIB-FINAL-12.15.16.pdf According to this, which I believe is the governor's proposed budget, 14.6% ($1.96B) of state budget goes to DOE (Pg 25 and 26), and 23% of the general fund. I think the DOE is getting significant support from the lawmakers. I certainly agree that teachers should be paid more for the work they do, but I also think it's a fair question to ask if we are allocating that money efficiently.	0

Thanks for this post CAEL.   I would just add even when the investigations lead to something, there is a great danger of justifying endless investigations that are instigated for the one purpose of finding something/anything that can be twisted and distorted to politically and personally destroy the person being investigated. The fact is I can't think of anyone who would be able to survive multi million dollar investigations.   I have always maintained the greater evil in the Lewinsky scandal was the misuse of investigations to attempt to destroy Bill Clinton and his presidency. The misuse of the Benghazi investigations (9 the last time I counted) confirms for me that today's Right is determined to misuse the power to hold and continue investigations until they find something. I also believe that this is what is destroying our country more than anything else.   That said, I am disappointed that The Clintons act as if this is not a problem, even when they are the targets.

"""...great cloud of witnesses and the power of intercession....""  Quite true, Jay Edward. The writer Flannery O'Connor probably best understood this ""cloud of witnesses,"" among other things, this Catholic mist whose vast assemblage and grace-filled multitude in the past was created by ordinary folk who venerated them -- in spite of the experts, the priests, the theologians. By  contrast, the virtues of O'Connor's good respectable ""Christian folk"" like Mrs. Turpin (see short story, ""Revelation"") were the vices of Catholic saints, ""virtues"" to be avoided, expunged from their Christ-like witnessing. By the end of the story, those ""virtues"" (in Mrs.Turpin's epiphany) had to be burnt from Mrs. Turpin's kind of people before making it into Paradise, before linking up with the communion of saints (people, from Mrs. Turpin's perspective, who were ugly, paralleled in physical deformity -- in bodily appearance, parts, in the tracks of lines, blemishes on their faces -- to low life and murderers)."	0

I don't think so. Fifty years ago, several feet of snow on the ground for a couple of months at a time in Walton was rather a normal winter. Nowadays, snow that sticks around for a few days is a big event.   That said, I wouldn't be surprised to see more big wind events, rare though they are and are likely to remain. We might also find that our summers bless us with more days with temperatures in excess of 100F and even 110F. Unfortunately, the trend line for water flow in the river isn't looking so good, so the warm temperatures might not be appreciated much.   Rather than take up knitting, I recommend that we lose some of that extra insulation many of us carry about under our skin.

One just needs to read the comments posted to this and similar articles to see concrete evidence that many older conservative voters not from visible minority backgrounds hold the closed, exclusionary attitudes to which Dr. Leitch's campaign is targetted.  Dr. Leitch will do well but is unlikely to win the leadership contest and her showing will tarnish the Federal Conservative Party, not only amongst new Canadian communities but also amongst many fair-minded voters from all backgrounds.  Happily, unlike during the US GOP leadership contest, there appear to be strong and effective voices raised within the Conservative Party in support of moderate, inclusive policies (i.e. against the excessive social conservativism of Dr. Leitch and the hardcore free market extremism of Kevin O'Leary) and this will help limit the reactionary stereotype image that would otherwise form.	0

I noticed that they clarified what they consider ""uncivil"", but to be honest that was pretty obvious from the start. The bigger issue is how to gauge whether or not the comment is ""good"". There is zero guidance for that.  My take on it is that a comment is ""good"" if it makes a clear point that is on topic. Seems a reasonable measure to me, and since I'm left to decide the metric for myself, that's what I use. The problem is that it's usually impossible to tell whether or not a comment is ""good"" because we're presented with the comments with no context. We can't read (or even know) which story the comment goes to, nor can we see the conversational thread that led to the comment.

"""it violates transgenders' human rights to privacy?"" The US has never recognized a broad category of ""human rights.""  The law still provides different levels of protection to suspect classes.  For example, discrimination based on race or religion are strongly protected while discrimination based upon sexual orientation or age are hardly protected at all (with some change in the winds).  Because there is no state or federal law that protects ""transgenders' human rights"" as a suspect class they are still freely discriminated unless a law or ordinance specifically protects, like Title 5 of the muni code.  If the only protection is on the same ""level"" it is not grounds for rejection.  If there was a ""higher"" state law that protected transgender rights then that would be grounds for rejecting an initiative at the ""lower"" municipal level."	0

What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said ""object"". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S."	1

Regardless of the Trudeau haters on this board, it is not Trudeau's call nor his negotiating skills that will help or sink a new NAFTA deal. I have never voted for a Liberal in my life, but get a life you ultra Conservatives. The deal will all be done or not by what the USA wants. Trump may not even be the main clog in the process. The congress has the power to make trade deals and the realtionship between Trump and the congress is, shall we say, somewhat strained. If the USA ulimately says it does not want NAFTA, we will not have a NAFTA. So Conservatives keep fighting at windmills.	0
"It wasn't Aquinas (who was talking about ""hope"") who slid from optimism to pessimism, but you.

Didn't vote for Trump but accept the fact he is our President..voted Don Young..not Lisa because Alaska is not a monarchy...not unhappy with her performance...held nose and voted ONCE for carpet-bagger because, as an Anchorage taxpayer, WILL NEVER cast a vote for Begich...not even dog catcher.  Was once a Republican Convention Delegate...they didn't care much for Ron Paul supporters...used every dirty trick in the book to undermine him. ARP=CORRUPT.  Regularly donate to worthy candidates..regardless of party affiliation (Mike Doogan comes to mind).    What I don't accept:  Those still butt-hurt about/MSM's blanket support of Hillary Clinton, in the face of her three failed wars (war pig), her absolute negligence with regard to prosecuting the greatest fraud in history (instead she took their bribes), her confrontations with nuclear Russia - over any/everything (Crimea=RUS), corrupting the Democrat party!

I can't say I agree. Britain tried appeasement in 1938. While Mr Trump is not Hitler he nonetheless has used some of his political tactics by creating a crisis where none exists and promoting yourself as the savior.  Clearly the PM has held back and did not criticize Mr Trump directly but has merely restated our values and offer assistance to refugees. A measured response.  I do agree the PM needs to walk a fine line as Mr Trump has a thin skin.	0
For a dividend investor, the sustainability of the dividend and it's amount should be more important than growth.

I've looked at the financials of a number of these firms.   A number of them (not all) have concentrations of business in Canada's most overheated housing markets that are concerning -- both in terms of insured and non-CMHC insured activity as well as other banking business.  What's really crucial for individuals who choose to deposit with these firms is to be aware of the CDIC limits and stick to them.   Because of the potential for short-term disruptions in a crisis situation (like Northern Rock) it's also a good idea to consider making deposits at a second FI that has a different risk profile.	0

I note that the study you quote is dated 1990, and even it said that, at that point, there had been no fatal accidents in military or commercial aviation attributable to intoxication.

First, the stink of corruption should be sufficiently obvious to the Liberal Giant Brains that they'll conclude that this mess needs to be cleaned up.

Second, the PM's defense of the practice is so amusing (""Can't buy a Cabinet Minister, let alone a PM for only $1500"" - now that we have established the principle I guess the haggling can begin), that I almost fell out of my chair when reading it.

"If Israeli families had zero tolerance for making martyrs out of their youth there wouldn't be any soldiers in the Israeli Defence Force. Instead, every Israeli teenager is conscripted into the military except for those who are exempt on religious, health, disability or criminal grounds.   And yes, it's not always the case that a rudimentary rocket from Gaza falls harmlessly in the desert. On relatively rare occasions they do injure or kill Israelis. According to the Israeli human rights organization,  B'Tselem, ""From June 2004 to 23 July 2014, 26 Israeli civilians (four of them minors) and two foreign nationals were killed in Israel by Palestinian rocket and mortar fire.""  So it's not the case that Israel has no justification for responding to those attacks. What Israel isn't justified in doing is responding with such force that 100 times as many Gazan civilians are killed. This is true both morally, and also according to the laws of war."	0

As for ""every $ spent in the state budget is important and/or essential to some group"", again I must vehemently disagree with you.  Is every one of those dollars avidly sought by the recipients, who would howl if ANY of those dollars were cut?  Absolutely!  But that does not mean that they are ""essential"".

Site C has echoes of the failed fast ferry project, with critics complaining loudly about technical problems that the corporation, Hydro rather than Ferries this time, seems to be ignoring. Sure it will be a great asset for BC if it works OK, but it suffers from a lack of granularity - it provides one very large capacity lump all at once, whereas smaller projects can be built as needed if electricity demand bumps up. That need for a lot of cheap power to compress CNG for export in a 'green' way  ( at ratepayers subsidizing expense) seems to have vanished. Let the CNG companies use natural gas generators to make that power on their own dime if the CNG export  industry ever materializes in a big way ( it won't).	0
This idea should be the ONLY response to these threats coming from the left coast. Stopping every train, car and truck traveling east from BC would be a boon for Alberta’s NDP.

An excellent article Dan. Thankfully, there are still some young people who do have a sensible, political head on their shoulders, those who do see the bigger picture and recognise that a free for all only ends in misery. Unfortunately, however, there remain a huge number who have been so indoctrinated during their further education that they see any alternative to their way of thinking as wrong. Bit like Jeremy Corbyn's way of thinking! However, whatever anyone might think of the economical approach to running this country, I am astounded that JC's support of terrorist organisations (whilst pretending to be seeking peace) is being brushed aside as if it were nothing. Try telling that to the victims of terrorist attacks, past and present.	0
So, if mail delivery is no longer a thing of any importance, it makes sense for that burocracy (and all the people it employs) to do as any private company would do in the same situation: diversify into new areas, to provide new services which the market DOES need and their infrastructural and institutional investments can be applied to. Delivery of social grants seems like an imminently suitable use for all that infrastructure now that we don't need it for letters anymore. Coupled with the post-bank - all the pieces are there, we already bought them with our taxes, why NOT use them rather than letting corrupt companies bribe their way into a lucrative contract they can then use to fleece the very poor people this program is supposed to help by tricking them into buying non-essentials (financial products mostly) with the money that's supposed to keep their bellies full ?  Considering how prone government tenders are to corruption, any task we can do without them, is a good thing.	0
Oh no you don't, that is no more natural than the use of birth control and possibly even less so.

Nope. Even the government's own numbers show a dramatic decline in GDP growth.

The majority of his predictions have been negatively biased since the financial crisis, any investor that has stayed out of the market in that time has missed opportunities.	0

Can i play with snake? yes but be careful if u want to play...learn the tricks.  Dont gamble. Women never feel strong. This is why most of them are desperately looking to get attention from the guys with the numerous cheap and dirty ideas. The strong women are not desperate. Thats one of the reason, men gets desperate and falls in love with that women. Men always like strong women. Feminism is neither drinking booz nor one night stands. Feminism is all about achieving your goal and be a sucessful lady...Women should not opt cheap ideas like revealing dress, flirts to attract men. Be succesful. Go for your goal. Men will chase you....	0
I live in Victoria and yes we do have some days below 7°C and we occasionally have frost.  But roads don't get slippery at 7°C and the one or or two days (at most) that we may have a dusting of snow are usually clear within hours as the temperature warms.  So please don't lecture us about saving lives by wasting our money and storage space on tires we will never need.  I prefer to stay home or catch a bus if I need to go out and, in the 5 years I've lived there it hasn't been necessary.	0

"2/ Of course the right and their so-called pro-life supporters enabled the election of a dictator wannabe who (entirely predictably) is driving the country to the brink of nuclear war.

Naturally these ostensible pro-lifers embrace the anti-science idiocy of climate change denial even amid this horrifying season of natural disasters.

The Republicans have worked against progress for the American people, even going so far as writing a letter to the Ayatollahs in Iran in an attempt to keep the President from halting their nuclear buildup.

Democratic Governor Tony Knowles got Bill Clinton to open the Arctic Reserve. Senator Murkowski may have passed some bills, thanks to President Obama not being vindictive, but she is unable to open oil exploration. On that she has failed.	0

Consider the facts, not the gossip, about Cordileone's thinking, actions, conservative orientation, traditionalist leanings, personal ambition and reputation among those he has dealt with since his promotion, and you will have a clear picture of the situation.  Remember, it has not been one but several vocation directors and bishops who have made formation changes from St. Pat's to elsewhere (even out of state), so their conclusions must mirror one another's.  Cordileone may be a perfect fit in another, more conservative diocese; he does not seem to match the culture in the Bay Area.	0

"Nope... IIRC he said that IF North Korea continues to threaten us, including our allies, that we will have to retaliate - with nothing off the table. ""Fire and fury"" are his exact words. This is what Trump calls negotiation.  This sounds like a lot like President Clinton when he planned the invasion of North Korea. The invasion was only stopped when President Carter prove to the diplomacy establishment that the North Koreans wanted to negotiate directly with the US.  The difference is that this time American casualties will be much greater because the North Koreans will be using nuclear weapons."	0

Haley lied when she said that the JCPOA “gave Iran what it wanted up-front, in exchange for temporary promises to deliver what we want.” - The truth is that Iran had to fulfill most of its obligations first—including disposing of excess enriched uranium, disassembling enrichment cascades, gutting its heavy water reactor, and much else—before the agreement was fully implemented and Iran got even a whiff of additional sanctions relief. There is no correspondence between reality and Haley’s assertion that the agreement was a great deal for Iran but “what we get from the deal is much less clear.” What we get is a cementing closed (even literally, in the case of the disabling of a reactor that otherwise could have produced plutonium) of all possible pathways to an Iranian nuclear weapon. This isn’t just a promise; this is major, material, already implemented change. http://tinyurl.com/y8wd9gyw Read the whole thing.	0
All of you who criticize Ige for signing this bill into law, seem to be ignorant of the process that got this bill onto his desk in the first place. Let me educate you: About SIX MONTHS ago in January, this bill was introduced into the Legislature, and for the next four months was re-written back and forth between the House and the Senate...as well as various subcommittees...before it was finally agreed upon by both sides of the Legislature. This is the process that EVERY bill goes through before it hits Ige's desk for signing into law. At this point, it would take a VERY COMPELLING reason for Ige to veto it (otherwise, the veto would be overridden by the very Legislature that passed the bill in the first place). There is no compelling reason to veto this bill. However, there is good reason for passing it into law...biggest reason being, in support of our still dysfunctional medical cannabis industry. You all need to think things through before griping.	0

"My wife and I paid 16% back in 1962. That was actually a bargain, since the going rate for mortgages under RayGun was 20% or more.  We paid off the k$60 1st mortgage in 5 years, 9 months, after paying off the k$10 BC Home Program 2nd program mortgage in less than a year.  Being in IT was sort of like being in an alternate universe of Gold Collar full employment then. When times are tough process improvement and automation are more important than ever for enterprises still around. Toronto was the only place in Canada with unemployed computer people, and ""Computing Canada"" made snide remarks about those folks being poorly qualified or unable to relocated because of underwater mortgages.  We could only make 10% principle payments once a years, so we invested the surplus income, and bought a 1986 mini van without a loan.  Ditto in 1990, when we moved to a home closer in to town. Paid off that mortgage in 1998, but got a 2 year loan for a 2nd minivan."	0
"The real number to look at is did wind power lower energy costs in rural Alaska?  My understanding is that the actual savings, even with totally tax payer funded wind facilities, have been negligible.  This is due to expensive switch gear, maintenance costs, the fact that if the wind isn't blowing hard enough, you still have to run the diesel generator.  On a global level if you want to look at how the ""green economy"" works for the middle class, just goggle Spain green economy.  It turned out to be a disaster with unemployment rising to 27% (50% for youth) and almost double energy costs.  Also left the government in massive debt and loans left unpaid.  They had to abandon it.  There are a few places like kodiak where it is also tied into hydro where it will work.  Almost everywhere else?  Not so much.  Its important that we be real about this."	0

A 2009 study of euthanasia costs found: EUTHANASIA BY INJECTION cost per animal $2.29 CO cost per animal (2 operators) $4.98 CO cost per animal (2 operators) without tranquilizer $4.66 CO cost per animal (1 operator) $3.09 CO cost per animal (1 operator) without tranquilizer $2.77 Obviously labor costs have gone up since the study, but the purpose was to evaluate whether what is considered the more humane form of euthanasia by injection is too expensive to expand the practice.  Answer, no, it is cheaper than CO, at that time $2.29 per animal.  A gunshot with a 22 cranially is ranked as more humane and cost effective even than euthanasia by injection, as it can be performed more quickly and in the field, without the need to inject the animal, which requires more complete control of a fractious feral animal and reduces stress time for the animal.   For the source, Google:  January 2009; Doug Fakkema, Consultant to Animal Care & Control, Commissioned by American Humane Association	0

"These protestors don't stand up for the country, respectfully URHONOR, they only stand up for their millions in NFL paychecks and the billionaire owners like Jerry Jones, watch and see! In the end all that talk about the ""right to protest for social justice"", ends up like that AC/DC song, ""Listen to the money talk""!  After next week's meeting, we can see just how powerful that money talks, because in truth that will be all the NFL protestors really cared about, if and when you see them all standing again for the flag and anthem. All that talk about rights will be just a PC line that backfired on the NFL! They'll make some weak excuse about unity, but in truth the president and the people put a hurt on their wallets, advertisers, networks, and all who do business with the NFL. So if it does go this way after next weeks meeting, and all the protesting during the flag and anthem stop, and the protests become just a sideshow attraction, the flag and anthem, people and president prevailed."	0

Under the first-past-the-post system, views like those of Leitch were actually represented in the Harper government which, because of our system, held nearly absolute power with few parliamentary checks. Many of the positions put forth by the Conservatives during the last election were actually quite close to those of Leitch. The problem is that, under the current system, a party with quite dangerous views could still, with just 38% of the votes, have 100% of the power. In contrast, proportional representation - while it might enable some with fringe views to enter parliament - would ensure that the voices of moderation could easily overwhelm such views and ensure that only policies (the result of compromise among parties) with quite widespread support became law.	0

i listened to all the mayoral candidates and not one of them mentioned the rich. we need money for this, for that, for seniors, for unfounded liabilities and all kinds of other things, but, not one mentioned that the rich have it and arent going to share a penny with the poor, downtrodden and hopeless and helpless. this is from hawaii business magazine-The estimated $7.5 billion master plan envisions 22 towers and about twice as much retail, dining and entertainment venues than exist now at Ward Centers. thats at cost, at retail, i have no idea what the total would be. from bloomberg-For the 482 condos in Ward Village’s first two towers, prices average $2.2 million. it doesnt help hawaii one bit if off-island owners park their money here. one way to get them to pay their share for running ordinary people out of town is to put a 100%, or more, sales tax on any single item sale over $1M.  it wont hurt hawaii at all if they dont come here. it just might settle property values somewhat.	0

Mr Trudeau learned from Ms Wynne and his father that the key to popularity in Canada, particularly in the big cities, is to spend money, and if needed borrow or print it.  He will continue to be, as today, very popular as long as he can get his hands on more money.  Also, Mr Harper wrote a book about the history of the NHL, Mr Trudeau wrote one about himself - to me, that says it all.	0

I track that information in a half dozen major categories (ie: housing, vehicles, food, tec) and a few sub-categories for each of the main ones.  Most banks offer the service as part of your accounts.  So it is not difficult, but yes, it requires some time...maybe an hour or two to set it up and monitor it.  One of the points the article fails to mention is which major iterms to subtract from income.  Should one subtract annual insurance payments?  What about utilities?  Muni taxes?  Given all these questions, and given that you need to consider them in this new calculation then why not just set up a spreadsheet with all expected period related expenses?  Good heavens!

"You will notice that it does not say ""In the late 1920s some 15,000 women a year died from ILLEGAL BACK ALLEY abortions."" Oh, you skipped that part? What a shock. No one knows where ""15,000"" comes from.  So much for your ""historical foundation"" pretensions.  In the late 1920s - prior to antibiotics - it was common to die from infections associated with simple operations. President Theodore Roosevelt's son died from a simple infection from a blister. My grandfather died from a carbuncle that was lanced in a hospital.  Sepsis was quite common.  At the time that Roe v. Wade was handed down, deaths from abortion were uncommon. Most illegal abortions were performed by physicians (83+%, with another 8+% by other medical professionals). The CDC no longer reports deaths from abortions prior to 1972 - for obvious reasons - and the Guttmacher Institute is a propaganda mill.  Kattha Pollitt, in this 17-year-old article, bandies some numbers about that appear to arrive from thin air."	0

Yes, sole purpose of a vehicle is to transport but given the size and weight of a vehicle, as it careens down the road it makes a pretty legitimate weapon.  Sadly too many drivers do not see the brevity of that. Hence, as I repeat myself yet again, exponentially more people die by vehicle than by gun.   Most average citizens who legally buy guns are purchasing for hunting, hobby, such as shorting sports not involving human targets, or for protection, for which most guns purchased legally by average citizens are ever used.  i am speaking very generally.  Also, if we did not have the freedom to own firearms, we likely would still be a British Colony.  The 2nd amendment was created to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government as a last resort.  It is worth preserving.	0

I think you missed the point.  Leslie's defence and security contacts are about to take some key senior cabinet positions.

Nobody defended Cecil Rhodes. If you know your history you would know that Afrikaners opposed the erection of the statue in the first place. Rhodes is hated more by Afrikaans people than what he is by rest for his role in starting and funding the Anglo-Boer war (Google Jameson Raid).

"Sorry, but you seem to deny that people have the ability to GROW in their understanding of issues, and to get beyond the barbaric concepts that were once held centuries before.

The church destroyed the manuscripts of peoples whose cultures it did not understand, calling them 'diabolical' [Mayan manuscripts].  These were ACTIONS prompted by DOCTRINES----which believed that ONLY the Roman Catholic church managed God [""Only we have the TRUTH""].  All of this is nonsense based on a man-made conceptualization of God---that God sits on a throne and wants humanity to grovel and shake as they would before a human emperor.   There is a sea-change going on in the church----but Cardinal Burke and the other wolves disguised as shepherds are not going to reverse anything."	0

Sooo, the logic is that we need to pay the commissioners a higher pay, so that we can get these guys out and get better more qualified people to run for office? I suggest that these guys would argue that they are doing a great job, and if so then why should we pay them anymore? They already are working for the agreed upon wage. It's being deceitful to have people suggest that pay needs to be raised to attract better workers. When really it's just a money grab, and those with the jobs now don't intend to leave or be pushed out. So what is it commissioners? Are you doing a poor job and pay needs to be raised to get you guys out, or are you just lining your pockets?	0

I have a suggestion for ANY college that invites any politicians on a regular and obvious basis to:  1) Make a policy change which does not go into effect currently, but waits until the current administration or occupant leaves office, and;  2) State going forward that it will not invite the NEXT occupant, whether he or she is a Democrat/Republican/Liberal/Conservative, and;  3) Set up objective criteria which may allow exceptions to #2.  ND looks bad in that it invited an extremely anti-life president, but BLATANTLY refuses the current president because Trump.  ND is being too cute by half, and it stinks. Neither Obama nor Trump should have been invited, but since one was, ND does not have any moral high ground to stand on. But, that went away with the Land of Lakes protocol.	0
In the American government system, there are three branches of government. The Executive (President and his cabinet), the Legislature (Congress and Senate), and the Justice system (Courts, police, Judges). The FBI is part of the justice system. It is supposed to be an independent system operating under the rule of law. So, a President can fire persons in his branch of government. But, when he fires the head of the FBI, he has crossed a norm of the American system and American philosophy of how governement ought to work. The three branches are supposed to balance and contend with one another.	0

"Yes, they do - and it's remarkably low. One of the things that it doesn't address is the vast increase in the ""working poor,"" a phenomenon generated by how things like housing and medical costs have far outstripped wages in the past few decades. The Medicaid expansion did attempt to address that problem. Arguing that Medicaid should be limited to the ""truly poor"" sounds good on the surface - who could be against the truly poor? - but in not defining the term, it's not really a logical argument, and doesn't address what poverty has become in contemporary America. I.e., take away the Medicaid expansion, and most of those people covered are probably not going to be able to afford insurance anyway."	0

I think as time passes we humans on earth will gather with different religions and cultures to do what is called  ‘dialogic dialogue’ to distinguish it from the dialectic dialogue in which one tries to refute the claims of the other.  We will do, Teilhard calls center to center unions.  Throughout the process, the individual elements do not lose their identity, but rather deepen and fulfill it through unions, discovering what is most authentic in each other, releasing creative energy toward a more complexified form of religious consciousness.  Christ of the 21st Century Catholic religion with its narrow and self serving attitude of superiority over all other religions on earth can’t contribute/survive to the global consciousness we humans are living on earth in 21st century.	0

I grew up in Marin County.

"Looking at this from the 10,000 foot level, the State of Alaska should take note of what is going on here.  It's called reaction to economic reality.  The Binkley's realize the basics.  When revenue is 30% less than expenses, you have to cut.  Brutal, but common sense.  The oil companies that do business in Alaska quickly figured this out when oil dropped by 40%.  They cut their spending by 40%.  Private businesses in Alaska followed suit in response to our recession.  Sales down 30%.  Cut expenses by 30%.  The only entity in Alaska that does not get these basic laws of economics is the State of Alaska.  Bill Walker still thinks the price of oil is $140 a barrel and fights tooth and nail to protect a bloated bureaucracy.  ""But tell us, what is there to cut!?"", the whiners of Alaska pout.  Take it from the Binkleys, cut 30 percent of EVERYTHING.  Heck, the Binkleys should be running the State of Alaska, not Bill Walker.  At least they understand simple math."	0

Obama, Bill Clinton, and the environmentalists funded out of Boston, New York, California etc., by a bunch of rich snobs have already destroyed thousands of jobs, families, and Alaskans who used to work in the timber industry through an endless campaign of litigation and lies.  Fishing and tourism have steadily grown and hit record high levels of production while logging occurred at much higher levels for decades.  Obama's idiot Forest Service chief Tidwell visited  a site in Southeast Alaska that had been logged decades ago and thought it was an old - no growth forest site, because of the way the forest had grown back.  This is just an effort to wipe out the few remaining hard working Alaskans and their children because the enviro-nuts and the democrats looking down from their ivory tower have judged them as being expendable in their view of the world.  Most Alaskans just want a chance to work, not handouts.	0

"Few popes have done more damage to the church than Pope John Paul II did. His malfeasance with respect to the clergy sex abuse crisis was a colossal failure of leadership and of judgement. Popes are chief executives who choose people who support their agendas to help them implement them. The word ""sycophant"" is as applicable, or not, to John Paul's appointments as to Francis' or any other pope's. Like many pseudo-conservatives, you use the word ""orthodox"" recklessly, incorrectly and imprecisely in an effort to score debating points. No pope in modern history was more arrogant, self-promoting and self-involved than was John Paul II.  In one sentence you aver that church governance cannot be compared to secular governance, and in the next you allow that ""elections do have consequences."" Karol Wojtyla began campaigning for the papacy at least as early as the immediate post-Council years. Elections are political by definition. That absolutely includes papal elections."	0

I set the elements out for you, straight from the statute.>>  This is why:  <<Yet, as ABC News Legal Analyst Dan Abrams explains, several key words in this provision also weigh against charging Clinton. For one thing, he claims that a 1941 Supreme Court decision interprets the phrase “relating to the national defense” to require “’intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation.’ This requires those prosecuted to have acted in bad faith.” That’s a high bar — there’s no apparent evidence that Clinton had reason to believe that her use of a private server would cause information to be obtained that advantaged a foreign nation or that would have caused injury to the United States.>>	0

Since I do not make my living in the biotech industry as you probably do, I read extensively on many different sites, mostly health related.  And no, I do not work in the health industry, either.  There are far more sites for information on the health side of this topic than on sites promoting the toxic pesticides and herbicides.  I'm sure you can find those if you chose, which I doubt you do.  In case you haven't noticed yet, I am commenting less on the seed itself, than what the chemicals are doing to people and the environment.  The fact that the industry has convinced, i.e., bribed, government officials to make laws that prohibit these companies from being sued by anyone, for any reason, speaks volumes about what they don't want us to find out and if we do there is not a damn thing we can do to stop them.

I agree.   This is the biggest problem in our church:  Lethargy - just wait until we are drained to no strength before we actually take a stand for what is just.

So why is a preacher involving politics in his church at all?  Part of the tax exempt status is to stay out of politics by offering a forum for political action.

Hi Marty, where have you been? BTW - I asked you some days ago to substantiate your statement that Francis (when in Argentina, as Bergoglio) had been known in the seminary (so you claimed) by the nickname 'la comadreja'.

Therefore it must be presumed that you have nothing with which to substantiate your statement.

Now it is about teaching/indoctrinating people with Social Values, leaving people ignorant of real life skills and in debt, instead of prepared to contribute to the real world.   This is not just an Alaska Problem, but it is growing so fast here it is shocking. The State as in the LAND is so Beautiful... the people and government are adapting all the negatives of the Lower 48. We didn't need WalMarts, and chain fast food joints now we just look like a Frozen California. Sad."	0

G&A: Nope, it's not a euphemism when one of the parties has to go thru near hell to get the Ok to have a comfortable surcease of suffering. Luckily there are people who will help. But they aren't killing the patient - the patient has made a decision and the helpers are being merciful. I hope I can find someone like that when it's my time. You can split hairs but there's no point if you really can't see the obvious. You and your ilk argued like this before the law was enacted - you lost. Big. In both the court of law and in the court of public opinion. We have laws now that allow us to try for a peaceful end. You ain't gonna change that, thank zeus.	0

"Look up the 2016 SAA AFS.  Two auditing firms have signed off on AFS.  Nkonki Inc (more than 30 directors and partners per its website)  and Price Waterhouse Coopers (4818 staff in SA per its website and one of the big four accounting firms).  The practice for some years in dealing with this delinquent insolvent company has been to delay, beyond reasonability, the signing of the audit report and the approval of the AFS until such time as SAA can extract more guarantees from government.  We are in that cycle now for the 2017 AFS  (year ended 31 March).   The 2016 audit report was signed on 30 Sept 2016 and includes rather a curious statement ""The factual findings report covered the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, and was issued to the entity and National Treasury on 29 July 2016.""  From which we can deduce that the unsigned audit report was given to management on 29 July but not signed until 30 Sept by which date further guarantees were obtained. See next comment"	0

As usual, get scientists involved and the quest for answers veers to the fringe corners of possibility.  Obscure niches that they covet for research grants, but that are usually pointless in finding answers.  This happened leading up to the endangered listing of beluga whales.  Lots of off the wall theories.  Then NOAA’s official beluga study came clean.  They stated the reason for the beluga decline was the obvious.  The simple reason known by many.  It was due to the unregulated beluga subsistence hunts that were allowed to Alaskan Natives.  No monitors were required on these hunts.  So for every strike on a beluga, only a few were landed.  The rest died from their wounds and rotted on the beaches of Upper Cook Inlet and Fire Island.  So if NOAA says Native hunters were the cause of the beluga population plummet, how do you know that is not the reason the population hasn’t rebounded?  Does anyone check freezers in Tyoknek?  Or what is shipped out of the Beluga airport?  Answer: no.	0

In the beginning I found myself looking past Trump's remarks, ie McCain not being a war hero, and still supported and voted for him. But since that time he has picked a fight with anyone that has disagreed with him [narcissistic traits] including now a respected NBA star for not wanting to go to the White House.

There are many downsides to fish farming. Parasites and pollution due to the large number of fish being raised in pens.  Also the feeding of commercial feeds which are not the same nutrition wise to what the fish would naturally consume in the wild.  Parasites have always been very common in salmon which is why it is common practice among Japanese sushi makers to first grill the salmon skin down before using it for sushi.  Most of the parasites are just under the skin, so grilling kills them.	0
"Geoff Meggs - another retread from the Glen Clark years. Is it not enough that Adrian Dix is still hanging around? Remember the raid on Glen Clark's house?

When asked years later about his support for Adrian Dix as BC NDP leader Meggs Dix was really sorry and had apologized.  Meggs is the same guy who as a Vancouver City Councillor was secretly caught on an audio recording promising CUPE a raise in return for a $119,000 donation.

Unity is NOT CONFORMITY!  The church is not a clone all over the world.  Culture plays a MAJOR role here.  What you are citing as a Moral Law of God is hardly the law of God.

"What evidence do you have that the current system is more merit-based than any new proposed system?    You act as if jobs are given out now by committees who are able to perfectly discern the merit of any given candidate and rank him/her against all other candidates.

People unconsciously subjectively discriminate in hiring.  Besides, even one's accomplishments aren't always due to merit.  Person A got a degree from Harvard University.  He was let in as a legacy admission.  Person B got a degree from U of Ottawa.  He worked his way through school.  Does Person A have more ""merit"" than Person B because Person A has a Harvard degree?  Does the person who's mom got them a nice internship have more ""merit""?

"Well at least you recognize that a fear can be irrational. and even if it does feel ""real"" to the person, that doesn't make it rational or logical in the real world no matter which side of the political spectrum one is on. The universality of irrational fears does nothing to make them realistic.   Your example of the anti-Harper fear mongering is an excellent one, and it proves that these kinds of fears are unfounded. The difference is that it's one thing to fear an individual, it's a whole other level of irrationality to assume that all Muslims are to be feared and that they all have the destruction of the west at heart."	0
"Yes, RI, ""the stagnant middle class after a decade of Harper's failed policies"" was one of the more effective as well as misleading of the Liberals 2015 campaign spins.   Indeed, the two Cs from Ottawa posters here are still touting that one.  The reality is in the twenty years from 1996 the Canadian middle class has seen a higher net increase in incomes and wealth than any other middle class of any other major developed country.  The New York Times (hardly a conservative rag) carried a report in 2014 declaring Canada to have the most affluent middle class among these countries.  The Liberals cleverly mislead the public by comparing the Harper years with selected previous decades of growth in Canada and declaring the Harper years wanting.  What they left out were such critical points as that all major developed countries had stagnant or negative growth in the post 2008 Great Recession years but Canada did better than the rest.  This is the meaningful comparison."	0
Part 1 of 2  The author's of this piece greatly exaggerate the extent to which even visible red lines, as opposed to the invisible ones supposedly being drawn by Trump, can head off international conflict. For example, both world wars were triggered in spite of the existence of clearly-articulated red lines. In the case of the First World War, a network of well-known military alliances among the European powers failed to prevent a rapid escalation of hostilities following the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914.   The British-Polish mutual defence pact similarly failed to deter Hitler from invading Poland in September 1939, which compelled London to declare war and initiated the Second World War. The Polish invasion was one of many red lines crossed by Hitler over the course of the latter 1930s, including military rearmament, the takeover of Austria, and the annexation of the Sudetenland, none of which slowed the drive to war.	0

"(1) ""Sessions told the Senate panel that he has neither requested nor received a briefing covering Russia’s attack upon the 2016 presidential elections, even though he is the nation’s top law enforcement officer"" That's because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation. (2) Public congressional hearings always involve grandstanding, from congresspeople and witnesses alike. (3) Attorney General Jeff Sessions does a fantastic job of displaying wounded grievance. (4) Trump and his supporters keep gloating Trump is not personally under investigation. I wonder if Trump is preparing to throw campaign underlings overboard if they are indicted? Finally, (5) I'm surprised Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak is still on the job.

As a gun owner for more than 2 decades (and avid outdoorsman), it seems to make a heck of a lot of sense to universally require background checks so people with felonies and mental instabilities can't easily purchase a firearm. Crazy people kill people, guns don't. Background checks are a way to help keep crazy people from acquiring a firearm. No, I know, they won't keep ALL crazy people from acquiring firearms. But they've stopped over a million firearm purchases already. Seems like so much common sense, for the life of me I can't imagine why anyone wants felons in their neighborhood to more easily be able to purchase firearms.	0
The spread of Cardinals throughout the world, as it is now, reflects the decline of Western Civ. as holding hegemony over church officialdom and the Church's intellectual life.   It also portends  a more conservative Church. Non-Western Bishops and Cardinals tend to be more conservative than their Western counterparts.  Perhaps the West has lost its hegemony for good reason. Christ is the head of His church  and he is phasing out the Liberalism represented by  European and American  Bishops. As the Influence of the west declines and other Bishops from other parts of the world increase in number and influence, we will find a more traditionalist and conservative church.   I always knew Christ would figure out a way to rid the church of all of the liberal, unorthodox non-sense that has been such a powerful force in the world and the church since VAT II. Praise be Jesus.	0
"Sadly, the $14,000 rebate is, by far, not the only subsidy that EV buyers enjoy. Other ""benefits"" at the expense of the public: virtually free recharging that is offered by the province in many places; the fact that close to half of the gasoline price paid by the general public is for taxes and utility fees that are helping maintain our roads and transportation infrastructure...guaranteeing that the more EVs are sold, the heavier becomes the burden placed on the general public."	0

"And having body cams and car cams would only protect the police as well.  Yes, police have a hard job, so why are they so adverse to having video to prove their innocence and show everyone how hard it is to be a police officer?  If there was video there may still be controversy, but there would be less opportunity for people to wonder what they are hiding.  The lack of trust (because of the bad apples) is the problem.  There are good cops and bad cops.  Problem is, even the good cops don't like the bad cops, but hardly anything is ever done to the bad ones.    So let's do them ALL a favor and put cameras on all of them and let the truth come out.  Sort out the bad ones and give everyone a break.  We pay them to ""serve"" the community.  It's not too much to ask.  The whole argument that ""it costs too much"" is a fallacy.  Law suits cost too much, lack of trust costs too much. Cameras are not that expensive (even good ones).

DUH - guess what - the total history of the church and its sacraments does depend upon how the church supports its sacraments via scripture - the core of the church's understanding.

Please yourself what you believe. You have personal preconceived ideas as to the nature of the Catholic Church so quite naturally you go searching for any support you can find regardless of who publishes it. In today's world you will find on the internet a welter of views, opinions and ideas masquerading as truth which suit your own preconceptions. I am sure that your intentions are 'good' but you have no hope whatsoever of persuading the Universal Church that your personal blueprint is the correct one. Francis won't be pope for ever, the Holy Ghost will eventually pull the Barque of Peter back on to an even keel. Don't waste your time trying to reform the Church according to your own lights, don't fight against the Holy Ghost.	0

Things have changed much (although not enough) in the past 40 years -- and this, despite the continuous attempt of some to halt and turn back change.  So, yes, we CAN change.   I believe that waiting for someone to take the lead is not necessarily the way to go.  We can each do our bit.  We can each speak up when we see abuse.  We can talk with our friends, our colleagues, our children.  If we each work towards the common goal of significantly reducing sexual abuse and making it unacceptable, we will succeed.	0
So we need to be a LOT more prepared than most, especially in our individual households.  We are going to need to take care of our own families and likely some of our neighbors too, for at least a month.    We need much more elaborate first-aid kits than most people have, and some paper books on how to do basic first aid, too.  We all need to have a bigger-than-usual stockpile of emergency food  --  like canned goods  --  and water.  We need a buffer supply of pet food, and any medications we need in order to survive.  We need to know our neighbors, and to have talked with them about who's good at what and who has what resources.    But, fortunately for us, we're closer to being functional in these ways than most of the folks who live around the Sound.  We won't be without all the basics for six months, though we'll likely be without all of them to start, and a few of them for even longer.	0

So there was insufficient evidence to support the charges. Good. Somehow when every body was asleep in the legislature they apparently passed a foolish piece of legislation that prohibits a government from inducing a reluctant sitting member to giving up her/his seat to allow another candidate to run instead.  That could be by offering the individual an appointment  etc at the disposal of the government.  This seems to make a lot of sense.  It allows for party discipline, the ability of the government to operate efficiently by providing a quid pro quo. The sitting member is not thrown into the street, no hurt feelings. But this would apparently be against the law, a form of bribery. The law needs to be revisited.	0

Perhaps the Majority has not noticed, but Democrats have been at the table the entire time.  After the Majority's budget was passed, there were all night sessions where Democrats proposed amendment after amendment to claw back funds that helped vulnerable people in amounts that are a pittance compared to the welfare given for Big Oil. They proposed that all the substantial funds already set aside for the mega-projects, such as the Bridge, the Dam and the Road be put back and used for more immediate necessities.  They proposed keeping the Permanent Fund permanent, rather than open the door for changes that disproportionately hurt poorer Alaskans and the private economy and that would disenfranchise future Alaskans. In significant ways, such as including income taxes and other taxes and reductions in oil credits, they've said they mostly support the governor's plan.  The Majority politely listened yet voted NO to every amendment.  They may have listened, but did they hear?  You decide.	0

"Msgr. Capella says this in the article: ""The Catholic Church should be a leader in child protection rather than a follower,""...  I believe this is what so many of us have been saying now since at least 2002. I would like nothing more than to see the RCC become the worldwide leader in the protection of children. My concern is that in his subsequent comments, he seems to suggest that the path to get there involves leading meetings, symposiums, etc.  I would submit all of that can, and SHOULD wait. The church needs to get its own affairs in order first. It will not build the trust it needs to establish itself as that leader until I can prove that is truly committed to doing this right. That means outreach to its own victims, and once we get that down, to other victims. It means changing its own law and culture. It means accountability, and likely a generation or two of doing things quietly that prove it's commitment.  Grabbing pics, or giving talks does not a leader make."	0

There are only 15 pgs. in the .pdf, but there are 26 pgs. to the bulletin. But you're correct, I messed up the pg. number. It's pg. 19 of the bulletin, which is pg. 11 of the .pdf.

My wife is from Kenya, and grew up speaking Kiswahili at home.  Since I don't speak it, my kids grew up with us only speaking English at home, but my wife has always regretted not making more of an effort to speak to them in Swahili.  The kids didn't really care much when they were little, but now that they are teenagers it bothers them when we go back to Kenya and they hear their mom talking to the taxi drivers or shop keepers or tour guides in Swahili, and they can't follow it.  It relegates them to the role of tourist in what they feel like should be their own country.	0

Deaths from opioids are over 50,000 per year.  Deaths from firearms are at 35,000.  The difference?  One is seen as an epidemic and the other just needs to be studied more, even though the Center for Disease Control has been prohibited by congress from studying firearm related deaths since the late 1990's.    1,300 children each year killed by guns and almost 6,000 children wounded.  While demanding action on opioid deaths is overdue and necessary, why does our US Congress and Senator Murkowski remain stagnate on addressing gun deaths?  Why do they muzzle the CDC on firearms?  Why?  Politics of course.  It is easier to ignore deaths from firearms because it will not cost them many votes in an election.  Who is at fault?  We, the voters.  Most deaths from firearms are from suicides and most suicides use firearms.  The results are almost always fatal, unlike attempts with pills or from using a knife.    Senator Murkowski, we need action on both. Now, not down the road.	0

I'm no fan of Don Young.  But Wolhforth, as usual, is making conclusions that defy logic.  Yes, Don Young helped get a lot of the money for this bridge to nowhere.  But other money was routed from the state budget via capital project appropriations.  Don did not create or manage KABATA.  That was a beast that local, not federal, corruption propagated.  The bridge was not all Don.  It was seeded by Don, but the massive waste was due to the state.  And Wolhforth assumes that KABATA is defunct because their sign was taken down and because Walker said for the second time that the project is over.  Well, what about the $40 million they still have?  And if Walker says, for the second time, that this project is done ... what proof do we have that this isn't just another lie from Walker?	0
you are the false narative bud,,, As of early 1945, any advocate of surrender or even of making peace would have been assassinated by fanatical military officers.  Finally, on June 22, the emperor stated his desire that surrender be considered and the possibilities be investigated.  As late as July 21, Foreign Minister Togo repeated his advice to Japan's ambassador in Moscow that unconditional surrender (the firm demand of the Allies' July 26 Potsdam Declaration) was unacceptable.  After the Potsdam Declaration text was leafletted into Japan, Prime Minister Suzuki publicly announced that Japan rejected its terms.   try again bud	0
"Respectfully, your comment makes no sense. If we were so lucky as to have a ""huge corporation"" locate here, providing many 100""s or even thousand's of new, good paying jobs, resulting in the accompanying windfall of tax revenue and huge increases to local small businesses profits and our economy in general, how would this corporation consuming a few million gallons of water negatively impact small local businesses ability to survive? The city has an Elwha River municipal water right that allows 32.3 million gallons per day. Right now, the city uses between 2.75 million and 3.4 million gallons a day, with peak daily consumption between 6.10 million and 7.17 million gallons daily.  Without a better job outlook than we have today, this town may not survive, making the discussion of a city council and who will preside over it a moot point."	0

I'm not certain Southwest really wants to run an interisland service.  Which is probably why they haven't committed to this.  Southwest has been known to use only one type of aircraft the 737s.  So it would mean devoting a fleet of aircraft (probably 8 to 10), establishing a maintenance facility, and staff it.  That's a lot of capital for a limited market and I don't think the margins are that profitable for the interisland flights.  They may be better off teaming with Island Air to provide the intersiland connections.	0
"That Wicked Which Wynne and Mental Midgit McGuinty caused such unnecessary but predictable damage to this Province.

Ms. Parker's columns are often insightful, but on this one I must disagree with her analysis.  In this case words were lethal.  Teenage boys are enormously vulnerable to opinions from their peers, especially females.  Whatever her motive for wanting Roy dead, Michelle Carter did know what she was doing.  She taunted him, not a momentary whim but repeatedly, and even though she was not physically present at his death, she was virtually present and knew just what to say.  The urge to take the final step came not from his own mind, but Michelle Carter's.	0

"""He embodies none of the characteristics of the young men who are meant to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent."" This would seem to be true for many current or aspiring politicians. One need only look at Hillary Clinton and her husband and you could easily insert her name. Politics is dirty business. Trump is a commercial real estate ""tycoon"". Anybody who knows anything about that industry will tell you it's rough and tumble with all sorts of unsavoury characters.

Some of Lisa's expenses make no sense at all.  I wonder if the Globe writers are snoozing on this one .  According to the profile, she spends $100 per month on groceries plus $75 on dining out.

That's 11% of her gross pay.   I don't buy it Globe FF.	0

I called in to the TDSB and our Trustee to discuss this troubling matter. I know of many young children who attend arts schools across the city, visible minorities and children from disadvantaged economic backgrounds. To keep these gifted children from reaching their full potential would be criminal and encourage those parents with money to send them to private schools, helping to create the inequality these misguided TDSB board members fail to grasp. The arts have been starved for decades in the TDSB but there always seems to be money for sports. It is time to stand up to the TDSB and urge the Trustees to represent those kids who are talented and willing to strive towards excellence and away from mediocrity.	0
"My neighbor, a Providence hospital nurse cared for Doug all through his hospital stay following his industrial accident in Eagle River. My neighbor has an old-school nurse, white starched dress and white polished shoes and her unique nurse cap on top of a mane of white hair. She said, ""Doug had beautiful eyes.""  I was the first firefighter to enter the tiny apartment following the shooting. Women  in the apartment where screaming. Screaming at the police, screaming at each other, screaming at me to do something. The smell of gunfire was thick and laying on the beanbag chair was what was left of Doug all shot up. The lady next door laid on a couch had bullets zoomed all around her as she watched TV.  What a horrible and tragic memory I have of that night."	0

"Actually, the similarity is not with the works of Thomas Cranmer but the modern liturgies found in the current Anglican prayer books in different nations. McHale doesn't know much about the 16th-century Prayer Books and would be on much stronger ground noting the similarities between the modern RC Mass and CURRENT mainline Anglican and Lutheran eucharistic liturgies.

This is more than ridiculous. Terminal or terminus simply refers to the end of something. Airport terminals are the ends of the flight, ferry terminals are the end of sea voyages, and it sounds appropriate that a road that ends at a river is therefore terminal (the end of the road).

But now I find myself using E-470 at least once or twice a month just because it's so much better than the alternatives.  And that's what it's ultimately about -- comparing to the alternative. Since we AREN'T building many new (""free"") roads, or expanding many, a toll road is better than nothing.    And since the gas tax continues to spiral downward in real terms (due to it not being inflation-adjusted, or keeping up with shifting MPG), I feel like paying tolls is really just the offset for the savings we've been realizing on the shrinking gas tax."	0

Trying to equate racial discrimination with transgenders is a weak argument.  Public toilets since the beginning have been based on either being a male or female sexually, not on what one claims to be or wishes they were.  If nothing else it is common sense and most parents do not want young children exposed to the transgender or opposite sex bathroom experience.   Public toilets are available based on the physical sex of each individual, or in some cases facilities with limited access that have locks on the doors.   Why is this not perfectly acceptable? What of the rights of millions of people whose religious or personal beliefs reject the transgender life as sinful or immoral? Why insist everyone using what ever toilet that he or she wishes to use other than to force an issue that should be obvious in it's solution.	0

"Well we can't read Gods mind or speak our own words in place of his.  There is  the KJV Bible Iy talks about these things are going to continue to happen unless we ""repent"" not admit, but repent & change our ways.

It is written in       2 Timothy 3: 2-5  I was looking at a picture of what I consider a wonderful dance group.  What was the problem?   Out of about 10 people, 6 were all taking ""selfies"".  They weren't that great, it goes a little overboard!

I have personally lost trust in City government under Caldwell. I find him dishonest, untrustworthy, and lacking integrity.

I can't think of any reason to vote for him, as he hasn't seemed to do much to better the lives of his constituents beyond his union buddies.

How about the abyssmally stupid actions against the environment?  Any conscience prickles there?  Is nuclear war brinksmanship okay with you?

I thought Schill had previously said he was looking to cut unproductive tenured faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences? His point was these tenured faculty were not carrying adequate teaching load, which was being disproportionately carried by non-tenured track faculty. So, then, how is cutting the non-tenured faculty going to result in sufficient cost cutting, while also not hurting the instructional needs of undergraduate students, for them to finish on time and not prolong their wait time to take the classes they need to graduate? There seems to be some incongruence between what Schill said and what he has done.	0
Sadly Nixon was soon gone after he came out in favor of this.  It was a pesky thing called Watergate.  Do you deny that Nixon did this?

It is thus just as important that economic, racial and social barriers not stand in the way of good health care as it is to eliminate those barriers to a good education and a good job.

Just to be clear, Father Leonard Feeney was excommunicated for disobedience, (he did not travel to Rome when summoned) and not because he believed in the dogmatic teaching of the Church, Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus.

The whole affair was an embarrassment to the Jesuits and to his juridical superiors.	0

If I ever move back to Texas I'm going to fly Chile's flag in my front yard just to confuse my neighbors.  I think it would be hilarious, but people in Texas take their flags seriously.   I used to live in Austin and this Canadian owned hotel next door to the office had 3 flag poles - one for the US, one for Texas and one for Canada.  One day they flew the US and Texas flags at half staff.  I can't remember what the occasion was, but the Canadian flag remained at the top of its flagpole.  It did not take long for people to notice.  Some of us thought it was funny that they were so ignorant of flag etiquette but some people were outraged.  I'm sure they got a lot of angry phone calls and they quickly corrected their mistake.  Flag etiquette violations run rampant in the US.  I once saw the Arizona flag flying above the US flag  outside of a government office.   Another time they flew the AZ flag upside down, but consider this:  Every Confederate flag is always flown upside down.	0

"I did not for an instant deny that the vast majority of elections have been FPTP. Not sure how you justify your charges of ""pesky truths"" or ""FAKE"", but have at it.  Two elections in the 1950s used STV. That's two out of 21 elections in the last 75 years that used an alternative method for distributing seats based on vote tallies.   Other provinces have also used voting systems besides FPTP. Pretending FPTP is some sort of immutable approach to tallying votes and has been our only approach for 150 years is incorrect.  I would add, that 58% of the people in this province proposed a change to the voting approach in 2005 (yes, a flipped result emerged in 2009). And this was a major issue in the last federal election (the fallout of selling out this change, for the federal Liberals, will be seen).  What I'm saying is, pretending that this is somehow ""done"" or not viable is, in my opinion, incorrect."	0

Any  steps in the  direction of censorship can be fought if they arise i.e. a reinstitution of the federal Human Rights law used to persecute Mark Steyn.	0

Speeding isn't the most dangerous thing on our roads.  Unpredictability is, not telegraphing your movements and not signalling is far worse then speed.  We are letting drivers of the hook and they aren't communicating or acting as is they are on the road with others and they NEED to communicate.  If they had this mindset / approach there would be a shift.    Everything is always geared to the lowest common denominator.  Enough with that, raise the level of our drivers.

I spent 45 years in the oil patch trades (diesel being one of them) with nary a nickel in a defined benefit pension package for me but stock markets have provided me with  a huge pot of dough to enjoy in my retirement. That pot of dough would have been even bigger if I had not messed around with rental houses in the 1980s and early 1990s.........very stupid moves on my part.  Good luck to you and your fiancee, Mr. Collis.  Diesel mechanics rule !!	0
