"Im not sure why you are posting right now about sarcasm in light of seriousness. First of all, her real and close friends are probably distraught and her family is probably going to generally have a hard time trusting this mans friends while everyone will struggle with ""i could haves"".

Lamont......my my-my....... aren't you the nasty one doing some rather vicious 'tearing down' of your own? If you had a chance to see the amazing condition of the FJ I managed to find, actually tried one before being so c ocky, you would be somewhat less obnoxious? You did not comment or pay attention to any of the quite valid points in my observations......instead, enjoying too much the smug joys - thinking yourself such a 'clever one' - of going on the attack?	1

<i>it feeds our anti-growth, anti-newcomer mentality. </i> With newcomers like Kate Brown from Minnesota, Vera Katz from New York City, Jeffy Cogen from Miami, and Tina Kotek from elsewhere on the east coast, I've had about my fill of the damned newcomers. Not content with having fouled their own nests, they seem to feel duty-bound to mess up perfectly fine cities and states elsewhere. Portland Is Over (now leave).	1

"Jack, No he doesn't. he calls the members of Antifa ""losers"" and he's right, they are. He calls criminals losers and they are. He calls politicians of his own party losers when they backstab the very people who elected them and they sure are losers as well. They should be honest and just switch parties rather than continue a losers charade that only the most gullible would believe. When you are a Republican and someone like Sid Schwab is praising you its time to switch parties, I think. . I don't believe I am a hypocrite. I am apparently 'witless' in your book as I do support, not follow, 'our' President and most of his policies. In America we don't 'follow' our elected representatives, we either support them, or not. Following is what people in religious or political cults do. Mind control is a very big part of how a cult lures and retains its 'followers' Our founding fathers learned from 'old Europe' and tried not repeating their errors."	1

It's hard to believe that the Republican party, the party of Reagan, who's defining ideology was opposition to Soviet Russia, now sides with fascist Russia against their own country. They are now the party of treason. We see democracy under attack all over the world. In Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, an autocrat is dismantling democratic institutions one at a time. The courts, the military, rigging elections, turning the press into a government propaganda organ. Becoming a dictator who will never give up power. Putin did it in Russia. Viktor Orbán is doing it in Hungary. Andrzej Duda is doing it in Poland. Hugo chavez did it in Venezuela and Nicolás Maduro succeeded him upon his death. Don't think it can't happen in here. It's happening.	0

Black Lives Matter kills cops. Muslims drive cars into people in London and Nice. Leftist shoots republican congressman at a baseball game......

"I wouldn't do it as vouchers but as charter schools and public school choice. Rather than giving people a voucher, parents could ""shop"" for the school that they want their kids to attend. There could be specialized schools - trade schools, language academies, math and science academies, art academies. Some schools like an art academy or a special math school, the kids might need a test to get into but others would just be done by lottery. This is how New Orleans does its school system. There are legit criticisms of charter schools like them expelling problem kids and relying too much on standardized tests but these can be fixed. There can be laws to prevent charter schools from expelling kids to up their academics and evaluation can be on other measures than testing (i.e. drop out rates, teacher evaluations, student engagement, graduation and college acceptance.)"	0
Keep whistling by the NFL graveyard, Mr. Goodell. I turned off your games last year when you refused to tell the players to keep their politics off the ball field.

The fact that Putin/Trumpski was elected says everything about those who voted for him and nothing about President Obama and the majority of the American people who voted for him. Trump continues to be a cheat, a pathological liar and a traitor.	1
What would you qualify as 'the authentic Catholics'? Would you call all those clergies who rape children in confessionals & sacristies? Or all those so call bishops who let these sacrileges go on for over thirty years let alone couldn't care about the innocent children who's life are ruined? Or Pope F., C. Pell, C. O'Malley dilly dally deceiving whole world for three years accomplishing nothing in resolving clergy sex abuse of children problems? Or like Ab. Jerome Edward Listecki, & C. Dolan, who swindle money from clergy sex abused victims? Well, take your pick, since you sound like you know who are 'the authentic Catholics'!!! You sound like one of those condescending authentic Catholic without ounce of humility! And so judgmental too! I would not call those people 'the authentic Catholics'!!!!! LOLOLOLOLOL!	1
By any math, a crowd of 6000 supporters in Montreal is more impressive than a little online club of 6 detractors. There are millions of people throughout the world who want to remind themselves, after six months of the loud alternative, what a President of intellect and dignity looks like. All the Trumpers can do is gripe in their usual bitterness, making sure to look the other way while their silver-spoon hero runs his sleazy family business openly from the Oval Office.	0

"Darn, you're clueless! I saw every one of the guys you mentioned play - like I said you're 20 years in the past. They were ok for that time period, they'll be nothing special today because none of them, except maybe Ambrozich, could shoot from outside 10 feet. Just because couple of them could sky and dunk don't mean they were exceptional players, they weren't. You want 6'9"" thoroughhreds? Then don't watch UH play because you won't see them playing here nor most of the other conference teams either.

I see the comments here are largely anti-First Nations and are completelyavoiding the topic of transgender rights and Senator Beyak's obvious homophobia. I can only assume this is because they don't want anyone to google HOPE or the crazy conspiracy theories that the Christian Right cling to? One cannot conduct one's own private Truth & Reconciliation Commission here in the comments section. That ship has sailed. And there's no building a revisionist backstory that White Christians were just trying to adapt children to modern industrial Canada. Ha. If that were true, why weren't we seizing Old Order Mennonite children, Amish children or the children of Hassidic Jews? No, the policy from the outset was clear: Destroy the First Nations by eliminating the next generation. As for the Gay Agenda? Well, the Tories prefer to conduct that campaign through whispers and innuendo. And they cringe when someone lets slip the truth like Senator Beyak. That's hard to reconcile.	0

"Richard, what came out in November was a recommendation by an Inquiry Committee, not a decision by a tribunal. His fate remains to be decided by the Canadian Judicial Council after written submissions by counsel.(unless they agree to his counsel's request to allow him to speak). His counsel's written submissions are available online, and they review 4 overturned trial decisions in Alberta alone (including these two judges). Following this review, his counsel makes the following argument: ""It is not that the gravity of Justice Camp’s misconduct is lessened by other judges’ similar misconduct. The point is that public confidence will not improve with the removal of just ‘one bad apple’ where there is reason to believe there are others"" I expect Camp's lawyer will have more to say now that it's clear those judges will remain on the bench."	0

Many people are missing the point. A teen from youth group actually said that he thought that since AL, the Catholic Church has changed its teaching. He thinks that adultery is no longer a mortal sin. What would you tell him? God has a commandment against adultery. We must obey God. There are bishops with opposite views on this. They can't both be right. Did you read all of Amoris Laetitia? Did you read the dubia? If so, how can you consider those questions unimportant?	0
I can't speak to the dieting, but you should try a proper CrossFit gym! No exercise regimen--even HIIT--has to be joyless. Most CrossFit gyms are not. But the fun doesn't come from the burpees. It comes from the camaraderie; the development of new skills (or, if we're being honest, tricks); noticeable changes in your fitness; and , if you're into it, competition. I don't know what your gym is like, but if you want to make HIIT/CrossFit-style workouts fun, I'd highly recommend finding a CrossFit gym.	0
"Gay men have been vilified by society for their alleged sexual promiscuity. Straight buffoons such as Trumplethinskin are secretly or even openly admired by their male (and some female) counterparts when they brag and crow about ""getting a lot.""

No credentials, no evidence, no links to support your partisan claim. Although you did manage to insult Canadian Forces, good for you. But lets deal in facts and reality. Despite assurances to the contrary, the Iraqis did not quietly, nor happily, accept Canada's withdrawal of CF-18 jet fighters from combat against the Islamic State, new documents reveal. In fact, Khalid Obaidi, the country's defence minister, argued for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to change its mind in a high-level meeting prior to the suspension of the bombing campaign. - cbc.ca	0

"So. How do we flip this sucker ""Cold"" civil war to ""Hot"" civil war? To be honest, what we are seeing is the globalist political, economic, social, and leftist intellectual elites try to impose their will on those who are tired of being imposed on. Until there is radical social, cultural, political, and economic change; nothing is going to happen. Search deep down in your souls and you will see I am correct. I am just unafraid to say what I think."	0

That's dollars and dollars of money taken from us, which could otherwise be invested or saved, or debts paid off. A dollar today can be worth 10 in 25 years. But not if the government takes it first.	0
I see all of this as a culmination of every time the left has called the right racists and all the phobes - for years. They've said it so many times, people on the left believe it. It is very insulting to republicans, and they are very quick to denounce the group(s) for the very reason you see happening here. Trump is not a racist, but they are pushing this narrative as if he were the leader of the Ku Klux Klan. It is very divisive and inflammatory, and does not get to the root of our problems. The media is painting the alt-left as social justice warriors who have moral superiority and are fighting against racism. Today they are looking at the Charlottesville event in isolation. If you look at the whole picture, and look at everything they've done since the inauguration -- the violent protests, smashing storefront windows, burning limousines -- you can see they are not as nice and innocent as the left treats them. Not once has this behavior been condemned.	0

It's a good show, that's what's really important."" Corner Gas was garbage and the only reason Canadians watched it is because its ""Canadian made""--it wasn't funny, inane and I had to turn it off each time after a few minutes of watching it. As for Bullard-he got what he deserved-for him to ""bad mouth"" CTV after they gave him a chance to have his own talk show was disgusting. Ironically the show that replaced his show on CTV (The Daily Show) pulled in far better ratings than he ever did anyway. As of April 2017 Bullard has got enough to worry about with his possible trial for harassing his ex-girlfriend (Cynthia Mulligan)"	1

"Moderate, reasonable and rational GOP leaders had the opportunity to condemn Mr. Trump's candidacy over the past year or more. As this editorial implies, they were too cowardly to do so. Remember, cross the right-wing of the GOP and they will find someone to run against you in the primary, have their deep-pocketed supporters finance their campaign and you will be out of a job. Now, the Party is stuck with Trump and those leaders are trying to find a way to survive the election without Trump sinking down-ballot candidates. What a massive ""screw-up."" Each day Mr Trump manages to say something to dig his hole a little deeper. I wonder how he's going to manage to avoid the Presidential debates?"	0
No facts? I was there, and I own a home. My in-laws were there, they've owned their home since the late 60s.

We have three Aussies. Aussies are typically a non-aggressive breed unless improperly trained, bred merle on merle, have poor genes, or have a history of abuse. However, they can be stranger shy & owner protective. Ours have been the most loyal, sensitive, smartest dogs we have ever owned & we have had many breeds. Why was the Aussie in an apartment and around a possible stranger? They need room, yards, jobs, training, etc.. Maybe it sensed fear? There is more to the story and ide love to hear the other side.	0
"With or without intent, this latest Alaska law that subordinates a U.S./State's citizen's Constitution-guaranteed protections to a faux ""legal Indian tribunal"" from an equally un-Constitutional faux ""Indian tribe"" remains un-Constitutional. And, as such, this legal action carry no weight in court regardless of what Alaska common law says...the faux common law cannot be enforces as it is null. The political notion advocated by Constitutionally ignorant Alaska governor and his attorneys that a U.S./State citizen since the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 remain in their same statues as they were in the 1800's. Governor/legislature cannot subordinate citizenship Sadly not one politician nor attorney questions that Constitutional absurdity! And, between ignorant politicians and equally stupid attorneys who should never have passed Constitutional law, perpetuate the fraud upon the Constitution and continue to 'dumb-down,' 'gullible' voters. It is the citizens of Alaska who are being duped"	1

I never thought I would see the day when the editor-in-chief of Canada's national newspaper would be so supine as to apologize because a particular word was used that had multiple meanings, one of which offended some members of a particular identity group. Writing for The Mop and Pail will henceforth be much more drudgery than it is now. Now Globe columnists will be expected not only to know the multiple dictionary meanings of the words they choose but also the sexual, political, racial, regional, religious and other identity characteristics of those to whom the words are directed for fear of potentially discomforting the persons referenced. The last time I can recall anything this ridiculous was several years ago when someone on the Washington, DC city council said that the proposed municipal budget was niggardly (stingy) allocating funds for some project and a black councillor demanded that the comment be removed from the record as being racist. This is just as craven and dumb.	1
"Oh, I see Nancy. Unlike ""bend over Barrack"" Obama's red lines that kept disappearing (and is why NK feels so safe to threaten us today) and ""I didn't have sex with that woman"" Clinton said that we would never be threatened by NK again after he gave in to their blackmail in the late 90's. Now that Trump said it straight, you are finally coming out of your coma. And showing that, yes, you are insane."	1
Don't expect liberal or conservative governments to do anything to rein in corporations. It won't happen. There is no enforcement for any consumer protection laws (if they exist in Canada). Note however the liberals refuse to change the last conservative government law that allows lawsuit trollers to harass Canadians who may download the odd movie.	0
Jeff, You make good points. Palestinians, First Nations, and Canadian homeless are, by and large, weaker than folks like yourself living in middle class fools paradise, I'd bet you earned your semi-luxury, by and large, honestly. But these are no good reasons to turn a blind eye to the suffering of the vulnerable, to isolate them, demonize them, take advantage of them, scapegoat them, build a global economy on their backs, use them as a political football. You might have noticed, these are lessons Donald Trump's election has yaught us. (lol).There's a big ugly divide between middle class and working class. The haves ignore have nots at their peril and the peril of our civilized make believe democracy. The pie is only so big and no matter how big the haves make it, they need to share it with the have nots. There are none so blind, deaf and dumb as educated folks who will not see, hear or speak,	1

The average IQ in America is 100. 80+90+100+ 140 = 102.5 average. In other words, 3 out of 4 Americans can barely understand how a toaster works. While I was able to learn to read and write by 5 years old, the 3 peers I grew up with were only capable of learning to read and write at a 3rd grade level. Nothing is ever going to change that fact.

"""Our best versus their best...,"" says Gibbons, whose team blew a big lead, and won only because Betances did another melt-down, walking four of five batters faced, including two with four pitches. Maybe Gibbons believes that the four Yankee starters on the DL are not among the best, but Castro & Holliday alone are so far superior to the BJ's rubby dubs, I think he ought to go back to his dugout napping and leave the insights to others. Hicks is a pretty good OF, too, while Bird's injury has let to NYY having ten different 1B this season. And Estrada's vulnerability is back in play, after only a couple of decent outings to remind us of how good he was in 2016. Thank heaven for Pineda's inconsistency, too."	0
"To put it mildly, Margaret Atwood has written better books than the ""Handmaid's Tale."" In it, she has taken too much artistic liberty, and turned past events of history (taking them out of their respective historical contexts) into a caricature of her ideological nightmare. The troubles of women and men will never be solved or resolved by turning them against each other. This is simply a very shortsighted and stupid strategy. In history, women have proven time and time again, that when coming to power positions they can be -- and are -- just as ruthless and inhuman as men. The assumption that women - just because they are women - are better human beings then men, is just as false and silly as claiming the opposite. Unless we step out of this silly gender power-game, where claimed victimhood is just as effective a source of power and abuse as its opposite, we as the human community, and Western culture in general are destined to fail."	1
I like that. Very persuasive. Our Alaskan Senator must be worthy of attention and not be a legal military advocate of FEMA camps for civilians as her remarkable chosen public service. There's more to Alaskan life.	0
A stupid joke that makes light of an alleged sexual assault by a person in a position of power? Take two weeks off then quit.	1
It should be pointed out that the decision to base legislative representation on population, but to count slaves at a discount, was an attempt to limit the legislative power of the southern states where slave holding was prevalent, not a comment on the essential humanity of slaves themselves. The latter was clearly dealt with when slavery itself was allowed to continue. Sixty percent was the result of a compromise between northern interests who held that, if slaves were property, they should not be counted at all (except for purposes of assessing the wealth, and thence the taxes owed, of the states) and the southern states that held that they should be fully counted for representation purposes (even though they -- like women-- could not vote), but not at all for taxation purposes. Regardless of his other points, Caplan seems to me to be correct when he identifies black/white race relations as the defining thread in U.S. domestic history.	0
The reason he is owed compensation is that Canada failed to protect his rights as a citizen — despite being warned by the Supreme Court, the government acquiesced and allowed the US to illegally detain and torture Khadr. The award is actually good news, in the sense that it reminds our government that they can't just pick and choose which citizens they want to protect.	0

And not only that. The gospels were not written by the contemporaries of Jesus. They were the result of the passing on of oral tradition, and were the attempts by the writers to pass on the message of the Way to the people of the time and place for whom they were written.

Perhaps Max Bernier would be the fresh breath period Canada needs to break loose from being overly hamstrung and governed by huge governments. However he would face less of a battle with his peers, more with the voting public, which is so used to live in its 'secure' golden cage and doesn't like any loss of service, however good or bad it is administered. It remains to be seen how many drastic mistakes will be fabricated by our present regime in power until election day if people get ready for drastic political agenda swings, never mind the actual implications...	0

"I so agree, and while I could not in my wildest dreams vote for Trump. He was having fun, showing people will believe anything, no matter how far fetched it was. He was just saying what they wanted to hear, he did not believe it himself. Will Rogers once said ""A Fool and his Money will be elected"", so Trump proved that right. Skeeter Davis had a country song and part of it was ""a fool born every minute"", and so look how many fools were born listening to and believing Trump. Now to stress this point, I did not vote for Clinton, I did vote, but for the first time since I started voting I just never knew the two top runners for President, were not qualified to even clean the White House, let alone live in it."	1
There isn't one. A potential idea for an ordinance was brought to the board by a retired Deputy Attorney General of Oregon and a retired County Counsel. The board asked their counsel to bring an ordinance back and then they will make a decision.

I wish to add that I admire the history of the Jewish people and their struggles are many. I just fear for the future of the Palestinian people, and wish, against all rationality, for peace there. Ireland stopped the bombs, mostly, and South Africa stopped the apartheid, and though many died, peace finally came to Southeast Asia after we left. I recognize that many of the most fervent supporters of peace and the rights of the Palestinian people are Jewish and live in Israel, and goodness knows I wish them well to find that perhaps impossible to find path to long lasting peace. My above writing was a little dark and hopeless, and probably doesn't serve those who fight for peace, may they be many. Hugh Massengill, Eugene	0

I think Chelsea Lyons Kent should flip all her stupid small minded critics too - maybe many of her travel donors feel their investment made a bigger and better difference than expected. We paid for Bernie all the way through a dirty rigged DNC owned by Wall Street. From the out-set, we know the bs and odds against the establishment, media and cheats but we pitch in to make a stand and a difference - and we take this opportunity too to show the DNC and RNC up for what they are. We know the suffering, oppression and genocide that comes with liars and war mungers pre-ordained to continue more of the same with a pathway to the WH. The finger flip is nothing in the scheme of things - e.g.: not one iota to children in Syria. I'm glad Chelsea hasn't apologized - its free speech and I hope she walked out of the DNC.

SD, we don't even have to venture into those areas. I guarantee that a tiny percentage of kids who graduate from a 4J school know anything about the most important event in modern history. An event who's repercussions are still reverberating throughout our present world: the French Revolution of 1789 (and the revolutions that followed). How can people understand the present world without a deep knowledge of history? History is taught in such a hackneyed fashion today. It has become the pet subject of the social justice warriors, which is a real tragedy. And all history isn't equal. Western History should get a lion's share of the attention. If we are going to preserve our democracy, we have to know how fragile it is and everything that went in to creating it. Democracy doesn't work without healthy participation of the populace. Why then doesn't 4J teach even a smidgen of civics until high school (is it even taught then?).	0

Many know me as VapinJenn on the Juicin With Jenn Shows on vapers tv. Here is my story on why I started to vape: I am a former 2.5 pack a day Menthol 100's smoker and I sucked each and every one of those down. I started smoking at the age of 16 Dec 3, 2013 I was diagnosed with metastatic brain cancer, 3 tumors all not operable one on my motor skills, one on memory, and the one they are constantly concerned about is the one my brain stem I picked up my first ego/evod set up and my 22mg of e-liquid and as they say the rest is history. After over 20 years of smoking I never thought a simple device would work. Something that actually worked. No medications, no patches a simple device that helped me to quit the combustible tobacco roller coaster. Vaping is saving my life. I will forever have these tumors and will be in and out of Chemo forever, but I will NEVER smoke again!! Don't be a casualty I lost 2 people to COPD because of their smoking!!	0

"Coming from someone who has demonstrated an inability to think critically, that's just rich Scott. The parallel, which, like a 747, appears to be way over your head, addressed your silly ""follow the business license you agreed to"" comment. The baker did not refuse to sell them a cake out of the display case, he refused the offer to hire him for the sole benefit of the homosexual couple. The license the baker agreed to was to sell items that exist to the next person wanting to purchase them, not to be compelled to enter into contracts he didn't wish to be party to for the purpose of creating something solely for the benefit of the other party. That is analogous to the Jewish restaurant owner being compelled to cater any occasion because he caters some occasions. The restaurant comparison you attempt is fatally flawed Scott. It fails the most basic test of logic and reason, classes you either didn't take or failed miserably based on your offerings to date."	1

No one is specifically supportive of Assad, not sure where you noticed this? Trump wants a better relationship with Russia, what is wrong with that. Making Russian the boogeyman has not done anyone any good. Most of the people were killed in Syria due to the west's meddling. The rebels were founded and funded by the west. The only reason so many people died in Aleppo is because of the rebels refusing to give up and west supporting it.

Perhaps Monte Sahlin could help with this, William, but my memory is that in North America, one out of ten congregations hold the majority of members, and those largest churches are almost all around institutions.

How will this help BC? Are you serious? Property taxes, LNG royalties, municipal taxes, income taxes, GST, carbon tax, 350 long term jobs at the terminal (not counting spin-off jobs...all of which generate their own taxes), 5000 short-term construction jobs (also generating short-term income that would be ZERO if there was no deveopment). To say that this project would not benefit BC is ridiculous...the governments involved would all be collecting hundreds of millions in profit and the local economies of Prince Rupert/Port Edward would be getting 350 jobs plus spin-offs which would boost the entire North Coast economy of BC.

All of those books helped to shape our opinions and our activism. Let's not forget Simone de Bouvier's, The Second Sex. Women have always been hard on other woman. As a retired teacher, some of my worst Principals were women, petty women or Pollyannas who were afraid of intelligent, confident women, and still batting their eyelashes at men. And yet one of my best Principals was a woman, an ex military woman, who truly believed in equality of male and female students of all races and listened to all staff equally, taking into consideration opinions and suggestions. It is truly amazing to me that those books have not been read by young women who think they have it all. [They don't, but they need to find that out. They can't be told that fact.] My mother and many feisty Irish aunts were my role models, women who were ahead of their time--business women, academic women, who never took a back seat to any males in their company.

None of this is or has been the issue. The issue is the Foundation lobbies the government obviously quite successfully for money. The issue is how many organizations who lobby the government take the PM and his friends to their island. The fact that the PM has known him for years, or that he was an honorary pallbearer at his fathers funeral or that everyone supposedly knows who the Aga Khan is is irrelevant,. Where the taxpayers money is involved there should be some concern about the optics of this whole affair. However according to the PM, there is nothing to be concerned about. I guess he forgot he was elected not appointed Supreme Leader.	0
"A thoughtless reply.....if it was a serious one at all. So to lay it out a bit, if you were in a bad auto accident and seriously hurt, you would be perfectly okay with paying those bills yourself, which would be, conservative estimate, $50,000, right? And that as you advance in age and develop, let's say, diabetes Type 2, you wouldn't mind paying for all your medications, daily test materials and meter, regular doctor visits and bloodwork, and regular checks for all of the related conditions such as cardiac problems and loss of vision. And, as one who has helped literally dozens of people sign up for health insurance under the ACA, and qualify for the government subsidies to keep the costs down for most folks, I call you out on your misrepresentations here, joanp.

Recall that Trump lied about Muslim celebrations in NJ after 9-11. He also took out racially inflammatory ads in NYC in the rape of a female Central Park jogger. Even after DNA evidence and a confession cleared the accused black & Latino yutes, Trump continued to insist they were guilty. https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-says-central-park-five-are-guilty-despite-dna-n661941 I also trust the nazis and kkk to know one of their own, and he has their support. As my dad used to say: Tell me your friends and I'll tell you who you are. Trump is a racist. He's certainly not above exploiting that fact with his base--what does that say about them?--but he has a longer history of racism than his time in politics.	1

Trump again made a promise he can't keep: bring back coal jobs. He's using jobs as an excuse to roll back environmental protections, but coal has not fallen out of favor because of regulations. It just costs too much. Most utilities are moving away from coal to LNG, not because the latter is cleaner and emits less CO2 (which it does), but because LNG is cheaper and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. It's an economic decision by utilities. But goodbye and good riddance to coal.	0
They tried your plan already...it was called boarding schools where they had issues with trying to stifle the culture, stop students from learning their language, etc. While it might help with the costs, what are the costs of having children raised by a government agency instead of in their homes with their parents? Would you do that to your children? There are successful schools and they should be looked at closely. I taught in a high school where every student who completed the 12th grade had also successfully passed the HSGQE for 5 years straight, but no one was interested because it was a success story. The school was listed as failing because it was judged as a K-12 school instead of breaking it down to elementary, middle, and high school.	0

News Flash The reason that there is a suicide problem in remote First Nations communities is simple. It is the same reason that many non natives in northern communities take their own lives. Life in remote communities in Northern Canada sucks ass. Plain and simple. These kids grow up in the middle of nowhere with all the trappngs of a third world nation. They all have access to the internet and are well aware of the life that goes on outside of their world. It must be depressing to see a life style that you have no access to. The big question is why the hell they choose to stay there? I'm a First Nations/Canadian whose parents left the NWT and moved to Toronto. After Toronto it was off to San Fransico before settling in Vancouver. I've had a comfortable life with no hint of depression or suicidal thoughts. It is all about location. Canada has a lot to offer. if you choose to isolate yourself from those opportunities you have only yourself to blame.	1

So if hypothetically Canada and/or Mexico formed a pact with Russia and invited troops, heavy weapons and intelligence gathering systems into their country, the US would meekly aquiesce? No, it would invoke its dominance over the hemisphere citing it's own creation, The Monroe Doctrine and would bring the world to the brink ( and maybe beyond ) to enforce it if need be. I don't deflect anything, I recite the past to show a relationship to the present and how knowledge of the past can help understand the present and perhaps avoid future catastrophes.

It’s interesting that the author’s first statement is that facts matter, and that she follows this by soliciting our esteem for her and her presumed argument to follow by knocking us over the head with credentials. If I have a PHD in law it follows that I’ve no motivation to lie? It follows that I’d never exaggerate and or omit and or occlude events or details while trying to persuade someone about something? If whatever she has to say was said by the plumber fixing our toilet, it should be met no doubt with a hyper vigilant skepticism, while when received from her lips, or fingers, we should simply buy a one way ticket to oblivion for our potential objection and drop the latter off at the bus station -- because she’s a lawyer? “The person in custody is a Canadian.

Is this what happened to the Palin clan? Did ANY of them graduate from high school and did Sarah really graduate from Idaho State? My point being that since when was education valued in Alaska? GED? In Alaska, that means 'Good Enough' Diploma. It also means that people in the trades were more highly valued than academics. Think 'the' Pipeline'. Still, it has been my experience that PARENTS are the ones to blame if you want to point a finger. As a volunteer teacher assistant, I can say that only 5% of the parents in any classroom check on their child's progress in school or reviewed their homework. One can view the world stats on academic achievement with the U.S. near third-world levels. Alaska is no different. I'm positive many teachers feel unappreciated for their efforts in educating the vast diverse student population in their care. Yes, there are bad teachers but great ones too. More emphases on academics/trades/STEM, instead of partying is the answer IMO.	0

The DNC is an extremely formidable organization. It is well funded, well organized, and knows how to groom candidates and win elections.

Again, regardless of one's political affiliation, we can be certain that dozens or hundreds of the best attorneys and investigators money can buy have exhaustively reviewed the situation, that Clinton has been carefully interviewed and vetted to explore anything that might hurt her, and that Clinton has received a clean bill of health. Would a Republican congress work to impeach Clinton given the opportunity? Certainly. Will they have any legal grounds to do so based on her actions to date? Probably not.	0

And during that time, as the statute notes, the person threatened has to live concerned that it might be serious or might not.

Hello WLTDO. I was wondering who would be the first to point out the lies (one of) our resident bully spews. Thank you. Personally, I have given up even trying to have a discussion with him. He lies, he bully's, he considers himself to be the smartest in the room and he gets very upset and starts insulting anyone who questions him and proves him wrong. But that is the typical dem. mindset, don't let little things like facts get in the way of the thought process, blindly stand behind the corruption that is the dem. party, no matter how foolish it makes them. For me, the entrenched repub. leadership, who are afraid of Trump, since it is breaking their own corruption, is another reason to want him to win. Politics as usual is no longer an option for me, and for many many of our citizens. I love the fact that so many of the current old guard are against him, from both parties, I find them very afraid and that is a good thing. Maybe we will get the change we need.	0

"Nope. No where does our canon forbid women priests. It merely states only men can (currently) be ordained priests. This is not now, nor was it ever, official dogma, and since the 2nd part of the Greatest Gospel Commandment is ""to treat all the same as yourself"" - or you sin against God, is dogma in our church, and this applies to all treatment of all people, including treatment of women by men, and bishops too, it is actually against the greater dogma of our church to not ordain women the same as men. Ordination is a form of treatment it is something a Bishop does to those called to be priests. The Council of Trent does not state women can't be priests either so I have no idea why you are bringing that up. Doctrines and Traditions and Laws have changed throughout our church history and this hatred based rule will be destroyed as Jesus puts this evil and dividing principality of misogyny under his feet and this will happen very soon. Of this truth, I am confident!"	0

No, just some woman got the crap scared out of her. That wasn't injurous at all, I'm sure. Statistically, people who are at home during a burglary have a high chance of being injured or killed and that chance increases significantly if they are NOT armed. Having a gun and knowing how to use it (which this woman clearly did not) significantly increases your chance of survival. I'm sorry the burglar wasn't hurt, because he'll spend a few years in jail and be out doing this again soon. He probably won't even be charged with the appropriate crime ... which should be attempted murder. When someone burglarizes a house when people are home, they signal their desire to kill those they find within those walls. This is why it's legal to shoot an intruder, because they have signaled that your life is meaningless to them and in doing so they have ceded their own right to life. No criminal in the act of potentially taking another's life has a right to be protected from the consequences.	1
You of course are correct Jamison, but we need to avoid making a false equivalency here. Yeah, Clinton is just more of the same. But Trump would have been so much worse.

And we'll have the next four years to witness her agenda in action, but we've all seen that rerun before, haven't we?	1

Yes things are getting more expensive. We have now retained a new lawyer in Houston to help litigate, and we have other lawyers apparently getting ready to go to court with the companies up north. Since we have more producers now, (Hilcorp bought most of BP's operating units, Caelus bought Pioneer's unit, ENI has a unit) does this mean we have even more lawyers to argue against? This sounds a lot like Gov. Palin's plans from her admin. And Mr. Meyer says we're going to open an office in Houston (TX, not the valley). Sounds like we need a money pipeline to support the gas line pipe dream. Considering the resources we have, it wouldn't surprise me if we had some shale gas around which could be developed independent of any North Slope work. I wonder how much exploration could be done for $550,000? Just a thought.	0
Yes, use as a role model Mitch McConnell. Hypocrisy is the GOP ideology which lacks any sembalance of ethics or morality.

If I remember rightly 'substantia' means the underlying reality, thus we say the Real Presence. The accidents of bread and wine retain their physical properties but in reality are no longer bread and wine but the very Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The word substance has many meanings in English including a philosophical meaning akin to the Latin, 'that which stands beneath'. Most Catholics will not be aware of this and need not understand Aristotelian metaphysics. Most Catholics can not be expected to be philosophers and theologians and therefore acceptance of what the Church teaches is essential. In this matter the Church says to its members that the bread and wine cease to exist at the Consecration. From then on they are the actual Body and Blood of Christ regardless of whether one believes it or not: it is, in fact a miracle effected by the Words of Institution. If you believe it you are a Catholic, if you don't, you are not.	0

Enough shibai, Hodad. Low income residents don't pay property tax. No residents pay hotel tax/TAT. All residents pay the GET surcharge on every transaction/purchase of goods and services. Visitors account for a small fraction of revenue from the GET surcharge. The House plan that Luke and Tokuda proposed (raising TAT) would have been paid by visitors (100%). To justify extending the GET surcharge cash cow, there will be more stinkin bs excuses and lies in the days to come. Enjoy.	1

Governors Ultimate Power from the previous appointments of the British King, disappeared with the Republican's Centralized Government, the American Colonies then became named States. There are many Articles that state why the Democracy of the Democrats 1781 Articles of Confederation failed, the Main Reason was that after the American Revolution, was that the flaws of having a decentralized Government of the Governors having Ultimate Powers at each Colony. The American Founding Fathers also had Studied Plato's The Republic and knew that from a Democratic Form of Governance Evolves the Tyrannical Form of Governance, so to stop this they must Eliminate Democracy, after stating they were going to Amend the Democracy 1781 Articles of Confederation, the Democrat Rebellion occurred just after Shay's Rebellion, angry mobs of Democrats were lynching anybody that spoke out against Democracy, they wanted to lynch the American Founding Fathers. continued	0

I appreciate the desire to hear why people voted for Trump. Having NCR bloggers automatically assume that those of us who did are uneducated, stupid and know nothing about the constitution will not help the dialogue. As long as Hillary supporters think of themselves as superior, Democrats will continue to lose elections. More so, if you look at the breakdown of the white Catholic vote, almost 60% voted for Trump. Why? We are tired of being labeled and stereotyped by you, the progressive Catholic left. We are tired of being told that we don't care about the poor, when we do. We are tired of being called racist or sexist when we aren't. We are tired of being marginalized within our Catholic universities because we believe in sanctity of human life. We are tired of being called anti-immigrant when we do more to help those on the margins than most people. We are tired of being called anti-abortion, when we support all forms of human life, not just those who are unborn.	1

Trump and his team will attempt to change NAFTA to the benefit the USA with little regard for either Mexico or Canada. A skunk can't change his stripes. The Trump we saw before the election, and the one we get after his inauguration are one and the same. His ego must be satisfied. Appearances are everything to him. Americans expect the USA to emerge as a clear winner in the NAFTA negotiations. Canada needs to to be tough in our negotiations. Willing to walk away rather than being bullied and steamrolled by the USA. The chapter 11 clause was a huge disaster for Canada, lets not make the same mistakes twice. As other have stated, they need our soft wood and oil. It's difficult to negotiate from a position of weakness. We must be willing to walk away and make the sacrifices necessary to come out unscathed. Turning off the oil tap would cause gas prices to soar down south. Softwood, the same.

If we vote yes on every bond this election, property taxes will be approximately $92 higher than if we vote no on them. That means that most Anchorage residents will be on the hook for between $300 and $500 in additional tax burden. Personally, I find this unacceptable. The school district needs to factor capitol improvements and maintenance into the budget. Additional emergency service equipment similarly needs to be budgeted, and park maintenance and improvements should be yet another budgetary item. It is time for us to vote down all bonds for a few years until we can get spending in check.	0

The wholesale due process violations are inseparable from the very processes of the state, in all of its iterations, because these are proxy entities for the nearest kinship group and their descendants, who have the first claim to disposition of land that used to belong to them, according to the law of the united states government. A proxy acting as a trustee cannot take on the rights of the beneficiary, which is what the state has done and routinely does when it abuses its duties to protect the trust corpus for the beneficiaries. The over arching solution is to eliminate the state in all of its forms from any kind of administration of the lands of the Hawaiian Islands and replace them with the federal government's direct jurisdiction over the land's usage. You cannot give a settler who arrives yesterday the exact same right to land use as the original owners of the land. The kingdom is NOT going to be restored. Direct federal jurisdiction is the best real solution.	0

Trump's failure to live up to his supporters ? He has been in office around forty plus days. Most presidents are not ""judged"" until they have at least 100 days in office. I was not a Trump supporter therefore I am not ""disappointed"" by his actions. I think his ""actions"" are not too much different then when he was running as a candidate.

"One should be able to ask ""why could Trump be a habitual liar?"" then, maybe find a list somewhere of what respected journalists have decided are outright lies vs. misspeaks or miss-truths. Then you could go down that list, testing the objective things he said against official data and events. Then you have to ask ""Is what he said true or not?"" based on the objective data you should be able to determine that. Then you should be able to decide ""Did he know the truth and intentionally lie?"" if yes, then he lied. Perhaps he didn't lie but he spoke a miss-truth out of ignorance. Then you're left with wondering ""If he was wrong, wouldn't he try to correct it?"" His brazen ignorance shouldn't determine what facts are. Either he's right or wrong, at worst he's a liar, but facts are facts. You should be able to figure out what a fact is."	1

"""It reflects the Republican/corporate dogma that an individual is more important in every respect than society. It’s based on GOP dislike of public schooling in general."" === Mr. Brinkley tries to enhance his argument -- or base it entirely -- on an incorrect assessment of that which he opposes. It is not only ""Republican/corporate dogma"" -- actually the founding fathers' belief -- that the individual is more important than society. The enumerated rights in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are individual liberties and restraints upon government to protect them. Individuals exercising their liberties make for a strong society. Public education isn't the enemy here. Indeed, conservatives don't oppose using public funds for education. But there has yet to be a cogent argument why a state-RUN education -- with a board rubber-stamped and largely influenced by the teachers union seeking to protect its members' interests -- is better than a state-FUNDED education."	0

Oh those poor underprivileged suburbanites who have opted to live in the (relatively) low density areas at the edge of Toronto, but still commute to THEIR JOBS in Toronto! Maybe we should CONSTRUCT A WALL (Sorry, couldn't resist!) around the outskirts of TO to keep out all those so-and-so's from the outskirts of TO from coming in and stealing jobs from the residents of TO? And don't worry. TO still has an abundant supply of poor people to do all those jobs you hard-pressed suburbanites perform in the city. (Actually, given the places I've worked and the number of people who leave promptly at 4:20 or so to 'catch the Go Train', I suspect a lot of suburbanites have pretty good jobs in TO.

Sure, some people indirectly paid taxes and support for LTD, but how do we know they paid their share? And what of those who paid more than their fair share without being asked? There should have been a vote by the city residents on this. Just think of how many roads could be built with the $5000 paid by Epark program. No wonder they are wanting to charge for parking: To have more parades! It's a war on cars. Watch, there will be a bus entry promoting the West 11th EmX expansion. Obviously the reason for whole parade. You can bet candy will be thrown. A city that says it is so responsible will hand out fructose based killer candy.

Whatever you accept you can expect related consequences. In this country we have a high level of acceptance / tolerance of firearms. As a result... *The events in Las Vegas on Sunday night mark the 273rd mass shooting in the U.S. in the 275 days that have passed so far in 2017, according to Gun Violence Archive. *There have been more than 11,600 deaths linked to gun violence so far in 2017, which is roughly equivalent to nearly four 9/11 attacks in terms of the total number killed on September 11, 2001. *The U.S. ranks No. 1 in the world in terms of firearms per capita—with 88.8 guns per 100 people—and it has the highest homicide-by-firearm rate in the developed world. *Gun violence is now the third leading cause of death for children in the U.S. An average of 1,297 children die annually from gun-related injuries, according to a June 2017 study published in the journal Pediatrics Gun lovers believe the more we accept firearms the less we can expect violence.

And now Mr. Trump and Mr. Spicer are lying (so what else is new?) that Manafort was a small player in the campaign. This with the news that the Secret Service just requested an extra $60 million for 2017 for Trump protection during his weekly golf vacations, and to protect his adult children as they deepen the Trump cesspool of conflicts. This is on top of the $2 million per trip cost of Air Force One, its protection while on the ground in Florida. And then there's the $200,000 per day in overtime that we're paying the City of New York to protect Mrs. Trump. Trump is a psychotic.	1

"And the deflection begins again! Another shooting, this time part of the 3.5% of the population was the target.

The shooter's culture vs American culture. Shooter's Father is pro Taliban, anti American. As a Muslim is anti gay and no doubt expressed that at home. Shooter claimed to be ISIS supporter via reported 911 call before the act. ISIS announced an attack 3 days before. Shooter's ex wife now reports shooter was erratic. These are the storyline so far. He and his Father were known to the FBI and ""on their radar"" but the FBI couldn't tie them to any terror cell. Just like the Boston bomber and the San Bernardino shooters.

The comparison is ludicrous. Jews weren't killing people all over the world and encouraging others to do the same. They weren't creating brigades of young murders and strapping bombs on their children. A Syrian in America has all the rights and protections afforded any person entering our country legally. We as a nation admit more refugees/immigrants than any other nation on earth, by a wide margin. Europe is rethinking it's open door policy with good reason. We're constantly shown the pathetic orphan boy or girl each time the subject of Syrian refugees comes up although the majority are adult male Muslim. No explanation as to why only 4% admitted in U.S. so far have been Christian. Surely they're in as great a need for asylum as the fleeing military age male Muslims.	1

The article simply point out that ignorance is alive and well in Canada. People spend more then they earn and don't come close to paying off the debt with a higher then called for monthly payment, and then seek to blame the credit card companies. In effect the banks behind the credit cards, give you money and they would like it back. There is a fee for using the banks money, spelled out very clearly, if you don't like it, don't use the card, as a credit card isn't your right, it's a privilege. Don't blame financial illiteracy, as this is basic stuff.

We are entering a transitional time moving from being top dog to beggar. The severity of the situation is not discussed or acknowledged by Clinton.

"Hello Bennet, Your post makes no sense. Zero. It reads like a one-note agenda yelled from a preaching pulpit. The BIGGEST PROBLEM by far, contrary to your post, is over-prescribing. You seem to want to ridiculously pretend that somehow every little town in the midwest always had many hundreds of elusive ""existing drug users"" using crack and crystal meth, and their (whoever they are) switching over to opiates en masse is why we now have an opiate epidemic there. Wrong, and what utter nonsense you peddle. The BIGGEST PROBLEM, by far, has been over-prescribing, THAT is how all those little midwest towns go so many thousands of people hooked on opiates. Go read the documentary book ""Dreamland"", which spells it out very plainly and with an abundance of references. Anyone who has read about the history and statistics for this issue can see through your words to the plain agenda hidden not far beneath. Methadone therapy is a helpful component of treatment, your protest is silly."	1
"Your comment is evidence of a very common misunderstanding of yoga, equating the whole practice a an equivalency to asana/postures. A profound bow, done mindfully is a version of ardha uttanasana. Rosary is mantra practice. Both the Rosary and the Liturgy of the Hours focus mind and regulate breath (pranayama) and heart rate. Samadhi can be understood as contemplative prayer. ""Yoga citta vrtti nirodah."" (Yoga is the containment of the fluctuations of the mind."") Yoga has to do primarily with the focusing of the mind. The Yoga Sutra-s mention Isvara, but does not define that concept theologically. You may find Thomas Ryan, C.S.P.'s work helpful in addressing yoga ad Christian meditation. As for idolatry, the Yoga Sutras have a good deal to say about harmful attachment and the mind. Given that grace builds on nature, and yoga is about understanding and mastering an aspect of the natural, there is nothing idolatrous about yoga---unless one mistakes the path for the end."	0

Oh, and some time ago, you claimed that I compare people to Adolf Eichmann because they disagree with me. This is untrue. I say that those who claim that the magisterium is to be unquestionably followed are like Eichmann, because you and he take exactly the same attitude that orders are to be obeyed, not questioned. Those are the only ones I compare to Eichmann. Yes, I say that Pandora and RD are liars. I say so because they lie."	1
If I remember right Longs Drugs ,SBS and Gary Kings kept money in the state, the others send the profits out immediately and this money was replaced by oil money and Federal money so now that money is gone and we have a deficit budget and are looking at an income tax or sales tax to pay the state's debt. When you think of the dollars the slipped through Alaska's hands and out of state and still are isn't it embarrassing to have been part of the squandering. Billions of barrels of oil, tons of gold, millions of pounds of fish, forests of trees, Anchorage turned into a junk selling welfare city and we need to support this with an income tax and let the profiting companies off the hook, God what stupid people we are.	1
No. They would think that it was Hillarious. And the notion that Trump's retweet is promoting violence against women, when everyone with a functioning brain knows that it was aimed at one specific person, is the typical ridiculous overblown claim only a few buys into. Note that when Kathy Griffin held Trump's decapitated head, no one claimed that it promoted violence against men.	1

I am always telling you that I watch Fox, CNN, MSNBC and the Free Speech channel. I like watching Thom Hartmann but he is wrong on just about everything. Kind of like the old days, reading Tass or Pravda back in the early 70's, good for a laugh and some entertainment but not much else. I also read many newspapers like the NY Times, Washington Post and others. Being retired, I have some time on my hands. I also do a lot of historical research, educating myself about factual historical information.	0
"Watching Canada participate on the international diplomacy circuit is like having to sit through a painful high school debating team presentation. If Libya never happened, then maybe the kid with the paper route in the back corner wouldn't call them out on the ""If Assad is taken out, who steps in?"" question. But calling for co-operative action from a guy that the ever so handsome debate team captain jokingly berated for violently fuming over an Olympic hockey elimination, now that is where things get interesting, because the guy is a bully, and he eats clowns like the debate team captain and spits their remains into an acid vat before breakfast 6 mornings a week."	1
"I lived in an HOA community and got some nasty letters about my ""junked"" pick up that was legally licensed and insured. Another neighbor got a letter complaining about a deck she was adding. This gal hired a lawyer and did a little research. Turns out there was NO HOA!!!!! Just a bunch of busybodies that got together and decided they were the authority.One of these aholes used to walk her dog past my place on the other side of the street. My dog would go to the end of the drive and bark a friendly hello. One day the woman walked her dog on my side of the road and my dog stepped ONE paw into the street (I was watching). She called the sheriff and tried to get my dog arrested. Sheriff showed up and basically told me the woman was a b*tch and would tell her he gave me a ticket, which he didn't. Sold the place after that crap and moved to the country where I let the dogs roam free, shoot guns off my back porch and have all the junkers I want. Full redneck hillbilly."	0

Nothing but the truth: Thank you for sharing a story about how Portland-based economist Joe Cortright is critical of the State of Oregon’s transportation funding priorities. But what that has to do with 30th Avenue? The City of Eugene is using money from a street repair bond—twice approved by voters—to repave streets around the city previously identified as most in need of repair. As a major city street, most should celebrate that the City of Eugene is fixing a section of 30th Avenue. But as the City after repaving will need to re-stripe the street regardless, they are taking the opportunity to eliminate a travel lane for the express purpose of slowing traffic down. Although doing so will cost a typical driver at most a few seconds, it should do much to reduce motor vehicle crashes that result in property damage, injuries or worse. The City's priorities’s are right, and doing the re-striping as part of a repaving project saves money. This is good government!	0

"I""ll give you another one Ed, and I could cite dozens more. This one is the maybe soon to be Zika virus vaccine. Like many of these drugs, the US tax payer is paying millions for the R&D through the scientists affiliated with US Army and the CDC. In it's 'wisdom' the developing team granted exclusive rights to the patent to a French drug company because they have the production capacity to mass market it. They have not spent one dime on the R&D. However, because of totally incensed US insulin consumers who have already experienced huge price increases in insulin, the contract for the Zika vaccine is being renegotiated precisely to prevent this company from again gouging US consumers. Big Pharma is a big ethical sewer and even the best companies are changing their pricing practices because of the rapacious hedge fund companies that buy up small companies with drug patents to reap big bucks ...like Mylan did with epipens."	0
"Indeed, millions of racist rants have been posted since President Obama's election. Never has a President been so attacked. You speak about 'failed policies'..OK, address those policies. Don't, as so many over the eight years of President Obama's presidency had done, attack him because he's a black man. Don't as did Donald Trump assert that he isn't even a native born American. You brand criticism of the actions of ""white conservative males"" as racist. If I read or hear what I consider a racist comment, indeed I will confront it. If, as I've had happen, a white conservative starts a conversation about President Obama with ""that stupid N$#$%^"", indeed I will confront it...be guaranteed of that. Dishonest media!!! Fake News!!! In fact the news media works hard to keep politicians, including Mr. Trump, honest. When a Trump lie is exposed, his standard response is ""fake news""....""dishonest media""""..

"For Liberals the unmentionable words ""working class"" are like garlic for a vampire. Unmentionable. It's the working class that's suffering, but of course the contented comfortable middle class votes more often and more reliably for Liberals. So they spread the lie that the middle class is disappearing. It's amazing that the middle class has been supposedly vanishing for twenty years but still comprise the majority of Canadians. The message is always f***the working class; be middle class. All power (and benefits) to the middle class. That's how Donald Trump became president. Even if it doesn't happen in Canada, it's just not kosher."	1
"Sadly the public is incapable of focusing on the issues which most impact their lives. A perfect example is the local public which rails against the TMT, walls around Diamond Head, dirty restrooms, homeless maps, iwi and other issues of little lasting consequence, The ""public"" constantly seeks only personal visibility and attention, as if the political process is akin to selfie sharing and the re-Tweeting of gibberish. . As H.L. Mencken predicted a century ago: . “As democracy is now being practiced, elected officials represent, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move it toward our personal ideals. Very soon the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last and the high state and Federal offices will be adorned by downright morons.”"	1

Ridiculous. You are obviously friend to the culprit, author. It speaks to the tone of a relationship between two that are responsible for children. The comments speak to the character and intention of these top officials. The fact that they were exposed by something that was meant to be private is irrelevant. It was, after all, the carelessness of one of the perpetrators that lead to the discovery. We now know how these men speak of the young students, bullying and ridiculing behing closed doors. To think that it does not have any coorolation with how they treat students is obsurd. The only true downside to the exposure is that the targeted students now know what was said. Peeping tom? Shame on you, author.	1
Someone stated that Boston's comment about violence meeting at the step of his church being one of his worst fear as being selfish. No, it's an expression of grief-a very common one.

This is EXACTLY the style of education I've been pushing for. All they need to do is record all middle and high school lectures onto Coursera, Udacity or similar platform and have the kids watch the videos and then take timed tests online. Eliminate the entire need for traditional schools and fire the wasteful billions that go to fund the massive school administration every single year. Middle school and high school education is nothing but a cookie cutter industry that can be fully recorded and played back to students by world class PhD educated teachers so every student gets the very best education and also the same level of education.	0

All Trump voters may not be racists. However, they are all collaborators with the white racists to elect Trump. At best, they are Quislings. True conservatives need a new party. The last election has shown that the GOP is merely a white identity party. Just ask David Duke. He loves the election of Trump. BTW, I don't think the pro life movement is pro life. They are merely pro fetus. They can all justify killing folks once they can breath on their own. Their support of the death penalty and the killing of unarmed people by the police show they are not pro life. Heck, there have been hundreds of folks on death row that were innocent. They don't shed a tear for those deaths.	1

"How many gallons of gas do you use? I use about 15 gal/wk so this tax takes $125 out of my pocket. Add that to half our PFD Walker already took and this is a bad idea. It offsets less than 3% of the budget gap and barely dents the deficit. There are better ways to raise state revenues. Instead, Walker should look at the big value generating activities. Per Dept of Revenue 2015 Annual Report, the top two are ""oil revenue"" and ""income from sources other than oil."" Oil generated $1.7 billion for the state. Fisheries, a bigger fish than a gas tax, is in the ""other"" category and generated just $26 million of state revenue. The value of oil produced was about $14 billion while the fishery value was $1.8 billion. Based on value, oil companies pay 12% while fisheries pay less than a 1.5% tax on resources produced. If the mainly outside fisheries paid 12%, it raises $212 million and is better choice for Alaskans. But, Mr Walker is a lawyer and can't resist putting his hand in our pockets."	0

Munoz is a great example of how out of touch with reality the majority of our politicians really are. Any baby raping s.o.b. should be locked away for as long as the law will allow, period. There are no socially redeeming qualities within anyone who would harm a child in any way and at the top of the list is a child rapist(Jack) or someone who would facilitate the rape of a child (Hauge). What Munoz has done to the victims of these horrible crimes is nearly as bad as the crime itself in that they are being told that what happened to them does not matter, that in fact they do not matter. If it is possible for a politicrit to feel shame then Munoz should feel extremely ashamed of herself and do everyone a favor and resign (fat chance) and apologize to the victims in person (again, fat chance). There is one way to show Munoz the error of her idiotically misguided ways and that would be to vote this moron out next election. Remember the victims and help them and not the predator criminals.	1

Santiago was most likely a deadbeat, scumbag BEFORE joining the military. The only crack he slipped through was being recruited in the first place. As a veteran, I agree many vets need help for genuine service connected/combat related injuries. However, far too many scumbags, who happen to be vets, are dodging responsibility for their own actions in favor of a well-intentioned pity party. Far too many are stretching limited resources so those truly in need are being shortchanged. ==> Fall off a barstool, drunk off your ass and trash your shoulder = service connected disability. ==> Fall of a roof, under enemy fire and trash your shoulder = service connected disability. There needs to be a line.	1

"My tax dollars at work. I don't remember voting for this? I will add this to my bucket list - my list of spending initiatives and gifts made by the ""tax and spend"" Liberals that will help me decide whether or not I can afford to give them another 4 year mandate. Tax dollars to pay for contraception overseas especially in the fight against AIDS makes sense but abortion as a form of contraception does not get my vote or my approval to fund. I know condoms have not gained cultural acceptance in many areas but there are other methods of contraception that are much more palatable and safe than abortions. Why any woman would prefer/support abortion over these other methods will always surprise me."	0
Another totally pathetic editorial from the Globe & Mail. I actually watched the entire 1:17 hours of the news conference and I doubt most people did that post here. Trump came off totally in control whilst being relentlessly baited by the pack of hyenas press association. Best of all was the pathetic loser from CNN who deserved the slap down he got. What an utter moron who even at the end of the conference continued to harangue the president elect as he left the podium. When reporters are the news, make the news, comment with each other about commentaries something is wrong with the entire system. Being told you are rude which he was, to be quiet which he didn't and allow another reporter to speak all the while saying his network is attacked by Trump is a CNN new low. Only the Globe & Mail support of this type of behaviour is more pathetic. Obviously Chuck Todd of NBC saying you should start speaking to the average American instead of each other is lost on the press totally.	1

Alceste you are twisting and spinning my message, in true form to your 'progressive' nature. Your opportunity to fulfill your 'Democratic' right was wasted in November when you couldn't get enough people to care about your cause. The left keeps talking about winning the majority vote - the reality is that over 43% of the population did NOT vote - the real majority, don't care enough about the issues you raised. If anything you should be concerned at the general apathy of the voters. They don't care about your First World Problems because they are probably struggling to survive every day.

There is a ton of correlation between cognitive limitations and jerkiness. Jerks (ie: those who display antisocial personality traits/behaviors) can be distinguished from non-jerks via neurological imaging. Clear differences can be seen in the paralimbic system.

Of course, that is not an excuse to act like a jerk, but part of being a jerk is believing you are entitled to act however suits you in the moment, regardless of the impact your behavior has on others.	1

Kc, really? Before you make an opinion, you should base it on facts. Otherwise you look uneducated and foolish.

That is a significant drop of almost 2/3s. Studies have shown the sex education is the biggest factor in this decline.

"Ah yes. The fabled ""leadership"" of Trump constantly touted by Trump apologists. He not only fails to seek out any common ground or downplay any differences he makes it the forefront issue and then threatens those who disagree with him. To Trump all Republicans serve him and his wishes. That's not leadership. That's bullying. I almost feel sorry for Trump because he seems simply incapable of ever learning from his mistakes. He's picking a counter-productive fight with arguably the most obstinate segment of the Republican party made of mostly Tea Party members who campaign against compliance or compromise. Even if he ""wins"" he's alienating his own party members, creating undue resentment and demonstrating how others are not allowed to think for themselves or do their job of representing their constituency rather than Trump. And then there is still the next fight with the Senate where the Republican majority is even smaller."	0

"Actually I'm not a cyclist by most definitions, oops, there goes your premise. Although I do occasionally ride a bike on paths I require a car for all my transportation due to logistics.

Cities will be going in this direction so get used to it. No one disagrees that a cyclist will be the loser in a collision so there's no need to ""just say"" Most cyclists are also drivers so they see it from both perspectives. Perhaps ""ignorant drivers"" was a bit strong but I don't think that pushing cycling infrastructure aside because it is an inconvenience is the appropriate solution.

"OSHA is charged with the enforcement of safety and health legislation in the workplace—encompassing a federal scope that far supersedes the singular measure of success you've chosen to identify (workplace/occupation-related fatalities). Merely offering to give examples if your audience wishes is entirely unacceptable. Assume examples and proper citations are always necessary—especially when your opinion is controversial or unpopular. You have every right to congregate with like-minded individuals, express your opinion openly (and free from fear of violence) and most importantly, to vote however you please—but do keep in mind that beginning ANY argument with ""As an economics major..."" and then concluding without providing a single concretely cited example (let alone any information that qualifies beyond the realm of subjective opinion) only serves to undermine your academic and political judgement simultaneously.

They place a higher value on their beliefs. They WANT to believe that Donald Trump is a racist. They WANT to believe that people who voted for him are racists.

Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon.

We are so guilty for having short memories. Military families were given the option for living off base; mind you, these are usually those that are at a higher rank. They received housing allowances. Landlords decided to cash in on this new resource and raised rent accordingly. Local families could no longer afford the increase in rentals. To counter the increase in rent for the low income families, the State's response: Secton VIII, a rent subsidy program for low income families. To qualify, landlords were required to past an inspection as to the rental unit's suitability. Eventually rat hole apartments seemed to elude the prying eyes of government...long story, short:. The creation of another government snafu!	0

"“The vast majority of our officers are honest, hardworking and committed to public service. The few who are not must answer for their actions.” Com'on Carey. We not interested here in your first statement. Public servants are paid by the public and expected to do exactly that, in the MINIMUM. Yeah, yean. Policemen get our ""thank you for your service"" and ""you one hero"", but what we're really interested in having you elaborate is not about the first statement. We like you tell us ALL about the second statement. The stupid, crooked, corrupt, or lazy cop is like the cockroach in the stew.....one is one too many. Tell us public what we really need to know."	1

Screw you Mayor. Holding us hostage is BS. Cant wait to vote you the F out of here. I knew this was coming. Being born and raised here this is by far the crappiest ive seen the streets and the thing is is its not really all that much snow we have gotten. People want to think so because of the last few years but seriously this is childs play in the big game of snow.	1
Thank you!	0
To be fair, I have heard just as many vague statements on the budget situation from the other side of the aisle. Every government service is not essential. Pretending the state government is operating on a shoestring and that a significant cut would spell disaster is just silly. The example Dermot gives of cutting K-12 funding by 50% is hyperbolic. Has any conservative legislator suggested cuts of this magnitude to K-12 funding? In this sense, he is no better than the conservative legislator he is criticizing. I do agree with his premise that all parties need to have the courage to talk specifics on their fiscal plan for the state. This includes acknowledging and openly discussing the potential negative economic impacts of their plan.	0
This is reduculus and ignorant. Residents of the area should be furious. Using public dollars to defend religious idioligies of a few. PUBLIC dollars. Religion has no place in governance of public bodies.	1

I can’t comprehend what kind of devilish mind of the CI bishops could covered up for his crimes and enabled him to continue committing them! And He didn’t question them then and now why is he complain about their moral failure? They just did not possess moral what so ever first place. Is he ever think about the innocent children he raped? There lives are ruined and they will suffer the rest of their life! Is there anything that could restore their innocence and recover their lost childhood and dreams for these raped children? If he thinks he serving some jail time will erase what he have done to these raped children, he is not in the right place. It is a typical rapists who have no concerns for the victims, psychoanalyst says! Oh, God have mercy!	0
"I know and understand so much more about how insurance works that your comment was desperate and of course laughable. Here is how Bill ""The Rapist"" Clinton described how OCare works ""You’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and it’s the craziest thing in the world."" William Jefferson Clinton"	1
Most of Ms. Dresser's complaints boil down to a complaint that Canada does not criticize the US. This is generally true, and cuts both ways. Individual politicians on both sides of the border may criticize the other country, but neither government officially criticizes the other regardless of provocation.	0
There certainly does seem to be a trend recently in the entertainment industry to re-interpret history to suit 'what we now know to be correct'. Anyone know what the word, 'Anachronistic' means?	0
Let me cut to the chase! Trump is the most vile, ignorant, immoral, racist, misogynist, sorry excuse for a human to ever occupy the White House! And anyone who calls themselves a Christian, who continues to support and admire this cretin; is even more vile and disgusting! Why? Because you can stand back, watch and listen to Trump who contradicts himself daily if not in the same sentence, and correctly conclude he is a vulgar, lying, narcissistic nut job! Yet such people continue to excuse his disgusting comments and unhinged behavior which is on display every time Trump is on TV! The hypocrisy is mind blowing! The ranks of the Nones will continue to grow exponentially in response to this mindless worship of the Pussy Grabber in Chief!	1
aa cry baby left wingers,, no argument on the story or facts, just some bs accusation that in the end is meaningless nonsense.. and of course calling for the globe to never put out an opinion you dont like! what is it like to be a fascist bud!	1
There is no good party in this crisis, not even the Rohingya. There has been mass grave of Hindus found in Rohine. Those are the evidence of the atrocity done by the Rohingya resurgent. Why do we always blame one side of the conflict, while turning blind eyes on the crimes by other parties? Is it a coincidence that it is always the certain religion group that is involved and have our compassion? Let's look at some of the prime examples: - Bosnia - Kosovo - Chechnya - Xinjiang, China - Syria (yeah, our terrorists are better!) - and now, Myanmar Do you see a pattern?	0
I see that you are another helpless victim of a situation you think is out of your control. Corporationa want to make money. They make money when people buy what they are selling. Yes, WE can check on them. By sitting back and complaining, continue to buy what they are selling, accepting entitlements, thrive on consumerism ? Nope. Get a backbone and make some personal sacrifice.	0

Anyone who sympathizes with Khadr should be ashamed to call themselves Canadian. This story is a national disgrace and is equivalent to spitting in the face of every member of the Canadian Forces who fought in Afghanistan. Khadr is a convicted terrorist and his treatment was perfectly legal under the Geneva convention. He was filmed building IED's, the same IED's that killed Canadian troops, the entire Khadr family are treasonous cowards.	1

So the government is being required to pay back some of the surplus the Martin government scooped. Not a big deal. Over the long term, the surpluses and the shortfalls will cancel out, leaving DB plans costing the same as DC plans.	0
"An illegally classified worker with no worker's compensation protection is injured. He can no longer work to support himself/herself. The worker has no other health insurance because it simply isn't available or affordable because of a now pre-existing condition. The worker losses whatever assets he or she might have to pay for medical treatment and becomes a ward of the state under Medicaid and Welfare. Next Medicaid and other ""socialist entitlements"" are reduced to pay for more government consultants and studies. The former worker finds himself/herself at Bean's Cafe and/or on a street corner with a cardboard sign to perhaps feed his addiction to alcohol and other drugs. Meanwhile the contractor who wrongfully classified the worker is fined and rolls the cost of the fine into the next government contract and hires a lobbyist ""to get big government off his or her back"". Our legislators appreciate that lobbyist campaign funding while drawing extra per diem to to nothing."	0

I hope you don't have kids if you see this woman's actions as acceptable. And I applaud the den for kicking the kid out. She brought unwanted negative attention upon them. However, she will, and is already likely, pay the the price for her stupid stunt.	1
JPII protected child rapists, allowing them to prey upon children for decades, thus violating Jesus' warning about bringing harm to children, doing harm unto the least of Jesus' brothers and thus unto him, and providing wolves with sheep's clothing to enable them to harm the flock. Did any bishop complain about giving such an unrepentant animal a catholic burial?	1
The Democrat Post once again showing how anti-Police they are. Every person shot by the Police over those 5 days committed crimes that led to them being shot. The officers didn't just randomly pick them out. It's really easy to understand: When a law enforcement officer gives you a direct order, follow it or the situation will escalate quickly. That's not a new practice. It's been that way for hundreds of years in the United States. The people shot were committing crimes and ignored the orders from Police, which led to injuries. The Police did a good job of protecting us law abiding citizens.	0
We are at the point of technological advancement lots of new things are realistically possible. For instance... a family doctor in every family. A stand alone computer that keeps every family members birth to death medical records. Not only that it is a repository of all the genetic information for each. It has the ability to scan and do its own recommended blood tests etc. Only an outrageously expensive albatross of a health care system could make this competitive and workable. As families enter this amazing time in history diversifying like never before the Family Doctor becomes a central focal point for all members. It is truly an evolving doctor as it is on the information/ability cutting edge of health care capabilities. The mind reels at the possibilities.	0

The last thing this issue needs is more politics and politicians - particularity smug and sanctimonious Kenney. Kinder Morgan needs to be far more proactive in addressing the (imo legitimate) concerns of the people of Burnaby and Vancouver. Buying politicians like Harper to do foolish things like close the coast guard base at Kitsalano was entirely foolish and the anger and distrust of that action will stay with Vancouverites for a very long time. Trudeau opened the base but clearly that's not enough. Kenney's more of same Harper short term thinking. Notley's slow and steady should win the race, but as this author notes, Kenney smells political opportunity and he will tear Notley down rather than work with her to do anything smart on this file. Poor Alberta with such interlopers as Kenney playing them like barking seals.	1
It sounds like you must be a white person. Am I correct ;P lol haha! So your impoverished understanding of the reality of the problem of white superiority (she did not use the words supremacy as you sate) are obfuscated by the lacunae of your privileged reality. Try growing up as an immigrant, a minority group, or a First Nations member and then perhaps we can have an intelligent conversation on the topic. Until then enjoy basking in your ocean of ignorance.	1
In fact this sort of activity is one of the ONLY duties a proper Constitutionally limited federal government should be performing. This idiot is no different from every other leftist idiot. For them it's complete government control or nothing. They don't understand the Constitution at all.	1

Ms. Flowers Please read Conservative Paul Jenkins in today's ADN. We already have our freedoms. Now Mr. Trump needs to learn to close his pie hole and figure out what he's going to do and how to actually say it before he makes a further fool of himself and our country in the eyes of the whole wide world. Paul Jenkins said it all.	1
"Signer and his police force are totally ""mea culpa"" on this! Lay the blame where it belongs. At the feet of the Virginia governor, the Charlottesville mayor, and it's police force! Their democrat connections are worth more than the lives and safety of their own citizens. Virginia and Charlottesville next time elect Republicans. At least you can count on them not to use you as canon fodder for their political beliefs."	0
"Geologists are heavily embedded in the Fossil Fuel Industry. The American Association of Petroleum Geologists (Follow the money) was that last Scientific or Technical Group of national or international scope to hold an official ""Global Warming never happened"" position. Even AAPG had to admit that Climate Change is real, after a Membership Revolt forced the leadership to get off the Fossil Fuel Denial Bandwagon. It was a bit like Industrial Chemist Margaret Thatcher accepting the Science on Acid Rain after she was seated between two Lake Chemistry Limnologists at a Chemistry Convention Banquet in London. The had been chosen and assigned to present the Science of Acid Rain to her. Before that it was worth the Career of any British Scientific Expert to try and get through to Thatcher about the Science of Acid Rain. Thatcher also accepted the Science of GHGs as the most likely cause of the observed fact of Global Warming."	0
terencew, Yours is a typically dense, unempathic response of someone who thinks their own experience serves as a blueprint for everyone else's life. You have demonstrated a perfect example of post hoc fallacious thinking where after the fact, you create a causal link in your mind between an event that occurred when you were a young child and what sounds like lucky circumstances in which you now find yourself. Did you see the recent story of an 8 year old boy trying to protect his 6 year old sister from sexual abuse who was beaten to death with a hammer? How dare you respond to the prevalence of abuse, violence, and power imbalance with such self-centred arrogance. You perpetuate the pain of people who endure suffering and who don't have a voice. You are part of the problem.	1

We have seen a great outpouring of support for our brothers and sisters who have been impacted by the discrimination against their faith. Many who have protested have shown their Christian belief in aid to our neighbor, no matter their faith. The protesters were also not all Christian but persons who see our Constitution as a protection of all faiths and the right to subscribe to none. Since this publication is Catholic, the emphasis on a report would naturally focus on what Christians should do as their faith directs. I am impressed at all those who came forth immediately to voice outrage against discrimination of those of the Muslim faith and insist that we welcome ALL here irrespective of religion.	0

Regarding your numbers, Dennis: based on the priests that I have known in my lifetime, I would say that the vast majority of those who were unmarried were gay -- 80% (and I am being generous on the side of not overstating), at the very least. (And for those who are inclined to quarrel with me about married priests, please remember that in my Church (rite), that's permitted.) I think that is what makes this entire issue so ridiculous to me -- most of those who are insisting that gay men may not become priests are themselves gay.	1
Now that the majority of drug addicts are rural white people, the solution is not mass incarceration. Other than race and location, what is the difference? I guess Republicans are starting to change their mind on just saying no to drugs now that their voters are effected personally.	1

Wow, the hate coming from many of the posts of the left wingers always surprises me. One of the most overlooked facts of late is its very evident the lefty's are the biggest hate and bully group in America. This older style of shouting down adversaries by the dems and lefties, broad brush labeling conservatives as racists and bigots hasn't worked too well since Obama took office, as evidenced where the real power has now accumulated. IMO it was a legitimate question since the local media would not/did not investigate. If you deny that the local media would not have crawled up the posterior cavity of a conservative politician to get the story, then a conversation with you on the subject would be impossible. How about local professional journalists? Are you willing to go do some work and gets some facts out on the MOA?	1

"No, it wasn't. It was a thousand pages long and literally no one, not even Pelosi herself, had read the stupid thing cover to cover before passing it. They were in such a fervor to ram it down our throats while they had the majority to do so that there wasn't time. The fact that all of the above were on record making statements that all turned out to be false is proof enough of that, my favorite being ""if you like your plan you can keep your plan,"" as I sit here uninsured for the first time in 16 years. They didn't have a single inkling of the monster they were unleashing, none, despite the hundreds of experts including doctors who tried to tell them."	1

"Your man trump is a serial liar dude. Winning is not based on continuous, chronic lies: ""Biographer Timothy O’Brien knows exactly what booted FBI Director James Comey is going through. Like Comey, O’Brien was accused of lying by Donald Trump — and Trump threatened to reveal tapes of the conversations. But the litigious real estate developer eventually admitted in a deposition that he was the one who had misrepresented the truth 30 times — and acknowledged that he had no tapes. Trump sued O’Brien in 2005 for $5 billion over his book TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald. But Trump lost the case, and ended up admitting to a litany of lies at his 2007 deposition."""	0

"""The Catholic church and conservative Christian groups repeatedly frame the issue of abortion in misleading terms that shame women who end a pregnancy, whatever the reason."" The left shames the Catholic church and/or conservative Christian groups and individuals who choose to not bake cakes. There is no such thing as ""reproductive justice"". There is no such thing as ""social justice"". There is only justice. Either it is or it isn't. Adding or creating an adverbial clause does not enhance justice."	0
Sorry Work Farce, you're offering a distorted view of how the law works. If that homeless guy and that middle class guy each have no prior convictions, they will both get a suspended sentence or community service. But if either of them are repeat offenders, then they will likely receive a more punitive sentence. I know you're a champion of the downtrodden. Are you aware of the practice that some homeless people have of intentionally committing a crime in October for which they'll get a six month sentence- prison being a better alternative than life on the street during winter? Not always black and white, is it?	0

Of course they aren't going to announce how much they cost, and when a cost is finally pried from them by the PBO and the opposition the government will try every trick in the book to low-ball the actual cost and avoid the new PBO method of accounting. Why? Because if they admitted how much the things cost they would lose all credibility they had when criticizing the Conservatives for the cost of the F-35. Regardless of what jet the government purchases it is going to be EXTREMELY expensive when using the new accounting methodology from the PBO.	0
I see. So that's how it works. We take from the taxpayer to give to ourselves, pass a goodly sum back to these blokes under the table, then fail to ask them to contribute their fair share to the tax burden themselves. Can someone please tell Zuma's devoted yet misguided supporters that, so far from taking from the rich whites to pay them their grants, he's actually taking it from ALL the taxpayers - including themselves - to share it with his cronies?	0
"Kag, the ""cesspools of gossip and backstabbing"" may be a bit hard for catholic communities to acknowledge but you do have a point. However, such behaviour was also common in early Christian communities. We are human beings. But wasn't that the point of the incarnation? To be faced with our own failings and acknowledge them and become merciful ourselves. Merciful gossips 😇 Then perhaps one day, just merciful. You are correct though, JP II and Benny wrecked that spiritual progress for many."	1

The Land Use Commission can't build roads. They were irresponsible in approving the urbanization of West and Central Oahu without the necessary transportation infrastructure. But that's not surprising because the LUC is controlled by development interests. So is the rail project. That's why --because TOD is going to be allowed all along the rail line -- rail will actually make the traffic along the H-1 corridor during rush hour even worse than it already is. You can't force those new residents of Kapolei, Waipahu, and Pearl City to take the rail. A lot of them are going to take their cars to work in town.	0
"""Or the Stalin statue in Virginia!"" Yeah, that is very wacky. At first, I didn't believe you but here's the reference I found from The Daily Signal, June 4, 2010: ""This Sunday, people around the world will honor the 66th anniversary of D-Day, when over 160,000 troops from the United States, Britain, France and Canada bravely stormed the beaches of Normandy, marking a turning point in World War II. In Bedford, Virginia, a memorial to the invasion will be unveiled with statues of western Allied leaders, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Harry Truman. The memorial will also include a bust of dictator Joseph Stalin."" It certainly is puzzling why one of the greatest monsters of the 20th century would be so honored. Stalin killed more people than Hitler and many don't even know that."	0

Personally, I believe that Mother's/Father's Day is crap. Having children is one of our most selfish acts. Luckily most of us don't screw it up too badly and children grow up to be happy and productive people in spite of us, though all teenagers will disagree with this last point. Raising a family is wonderful, fun, traumatic, frustrating and an incredible blessing for those us who choose to embark down this path. None of the rewards however comes from an annual Hallmark marketing moment. So please enjoy your families, appreciate and support one another daily and forget this annual cloying contest of mutual self appreciation. If your children want to express their love to you on this or any other day, simply say thank you and stop worrying if you or your partner deserved it more	1

"I think that firewall still exists and there is still a separate ""Opinion Page"" in most American newspapers with views from the left, right and center published routinely. Amazing thing to me is that ""conservative"" editorialists like Jennifer Rubin, Kathleen Parker and even David Brooks have recognized the malignancy of the trump modus operandi and are speaking out forcefully in opposition to his divisive and destructive policies. The American mainstream media deserves a lot of criticism for it's role in creating an atmosphere where a cretin like trump would even come close to election as public works commissioner for Podunk, N.J. or in how they got so behind Bush as he launched his illegal invasion of Iraq. But simply pointing out that the glaring flaws of trump and his entourage most certainly don't rise to the level of being the ""enemy of the American people"" as he spewed out yesterday. The man is demented and it needs to be pointed out on a regular basis. America is in danger."	1
"All this just confirms my first initial suspicion about Trump, particularly in light of his long and close relationship with the Clintons over the years: his GOP ""candidacy"" from the very beginning was nothing but a farce and a well-crafted ploy engineered to guarantee Hillary's election to the presidency. Nothing he has done in the last year+ has led.me to believe otherwise."	0

Maybe you forgot about this twit that went to supreme court so she could wear a rag on her face during the swearing in ceremony.

If I wanted to show up at the swearing in ceremony wearing a thong and flip flops because I feel more comfortable in them, should I be sworn in as a Canadian? Should the media make that a major political debate? Why did this get to supreme court? This was not a suppression of religion. Here is an example of our country being changed.	1

... I've been trying to convince my father to enter this billion dollar bottled water market, he has a cabin in Wisconsin on the Wisconsin River near Taliesin with it's own cold spring gushing out of the hillside. Currently, overgrown w blackberries and invasives. His place used to be the 'tea house' because of the spring to wait for a previously existing well placed ferry. Not only would I put a bottling operation in, but I'd put in cold water wading pools/tubs.	0

"MSW doesn't address two other ""backsliding"" issues Associated Press reporter Nicole Winfield addresses: ""Francis scrapped the commission's proposed tribunal for bishops who botch abuse cases following legal objections from the congregation. The commission's other major initiative — a guideline template to help dioceses develop policies to fight abuse and safeguard children — is gathering dust. The Vatican never sent the template to bishops' conferences, as the commission had sought, or even linked it to its main abuse-resource website."" I find it troubling, if it's true, that many diocese have yet to develop policies akin to the USCCB's Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, and that ""a guideline template to help dioceses develop policies"" has not been sent to bishops' conferences, and I'm surprised MSW doesn't address this. As for confining a priest to a monastery: see my next post."	0

Banning people from seven countries seems absolutely reasonable when one reminds oneself that the USA is bombing and invading the crap out of those seven countries. It's called war.

All that the public protector did was pass comment on something outside of the question she was asked to answer, provide no justification for the action (the whole argument is two paragraphs; making it irrational), and ask for an unconstitutional action to take place (taking the power of parliament). If this is castigation then there something extremely remiss. If the ANC western cape wishes to change the mandate of the reserve bank then fine and well, but dont pretend that a legitimate process has been followed, go to the correct parliamentary oversight committee and get that ball rolling. Or amend the constitution through a bill. Anyway the other points are OK, communication over their roll in oversight would be appreciated given the various agendas flying around, but I imagine it that it is impossible for them to discuss changes the mandate as they have to implement it (the critical difference between civil and political servants).	0

"Yes, my wife, who also holds a master's degree and who was the breadwinner for the first two years of our marriage has chosen to stay home and ""play nursemaid"". She has chosen such a life because the second of those first two years of our marriage included leaving our baby daughter 5 days a week to go work to provide for us. She hated it. Although she was working in the exact field she desired (adoption social work) and was deeply fulfilled in it she still hated it because she just wanted to be at home and be present to our daughter. But I guess she's just one of those crazies among the millennial generation who can't see that staying at home and playing nursemaid is a pathetic way to live. She's also one of those women who was prescribed the Pill at age 15 for heavy periods but has still chosen to ditch it because it's a bizarre medical approach to actively suppress a naturally occurring event (ovulation) for symptom relief.

Follow up. A few years ago, I was on a UAL flight from LA to Honolulu. Everyone boarded, but departure was delayed because the co-pilot commuting from another airport had not arrived. Everyone deplaned to wait for the co-pilot’s arrival. About two hours later, a gate agent announced his arrival and said re-boarding would begin soon, but it did not. Passengers were angry and yelling at gate agents demanding reasons for the delay. We finally got the answer. The co-pilot’s delayed arrival resulted in the pilot being awake too long to fly the plane under FAA rules. That angered passengers even more and came close to rioting. United ultimately found another pilot and the flight departed five or six hours late.  The flight was scheduled to return to LA from Honolulu with a load of passengers, but the delayed caused UAL to put those passengers on other airlines or in hotels for the night. This debacle was costly to UAL, but the commuting continues. Dumb, dumber, the dumbest.	1

"""Technology changes, rights don’t""???? Since when? Rights constantly change. The biggest change was in 1982 when the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was enacted.

Rights of same sex persons, transgender rights, equality rights, etc. The SCOC just recognized a right to collective bargaining after rejecting it for 30 plus years. And currently a live issue before the SCOC is the evolution of a standalone right to privacy."	0

The Iraq/Afhan wars are failures because of the American people. The reasons the generals cant win it is because they know they have to fight it according to the whims of the people in this demokracy. The way to win in that place is to seriously bust some heads. WWII Germany and Japan style. Better yet: the way the Soviets did it to the Germans in WWII style. THAT is how you fight and win. Bomb em, burn em, break things, tip things over and set em on fire. Wage a hell upon them. Anything short of that is a failed waste of time and our lives and $$$. And no, it's not Trump or Bush or Obama or Generals' fault. It is YOUR faults for living a lifestyle where the societal expectation is that our military not win wars. YOU set up a society where we expect not to do things we need to do to win wars. Don't then go grumbling about us not winning wars. The other side wins because they have no societal constraints against winning. Losers..	1
Skinut, you apparently believe that form is more important than substance. Appearance (form) does not necessarily reflect reality (substance). You need to get beyond how Trump looked to you to learn about the outstanding support the Trump administration is providing to Texas. You can do so if you simply remove your anti-Trump blinders. But don’t take it from me. Do a little research to learn what Texas government officials have said about it. Many of them who appeared on TV have had nothing but great praise for Trump and the assistance his administration is providing. Not one of them said he did not look or act presidential or some stupid thing.	1
"""To serve, care, share with others is following Jesus."" A little more than that.

Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you and remember, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.'""

"As is typical of any industry's booster, you address only the benefits, without acknowledging costs- which are numerous and spread across the entire population. in other words, there is no honest cost-benefit examination. The same arguments are presented by developers (tax base- the ""bigger pie"" myth). Which is why public taxes & fees continue to grow even as quality of life declines.

"Amusing to see you are such a shill for PR that you even vote for yourself. The arrogance of calling oneself EducatedCanadian suggests a closed mind but let me try in the tiny space here to make you more ""educated"". 1. The UK, US and many other advanced, modern democracies somehow manage with FPTP. Increasingly, European countries who figured it would be politically correct and cause less grief from the mob to switch to PR are floundering as parties from the far left and the far right cause divisive legislative deadlocks and unstable governments. 2. The town halls were a joke ignored by 99% of the population and frequented by small party PR zealots and everyone knows it. 3. Most Canadians when they think of electoral systems at all think ours is working just fine. If you disagree, WHY DON'T WE ASK THEM? 4. By your definition, every majority government but 2 since 1953 were ""phony"" majorities. JT made lots of dumb, rash promises. He should back away from this one."	1

A very ideological government bent on ignoring every conceivable advisor and subject matter expert urging them to acknowledge that the ground game has significantly changed with Trump, and that plans must be re-considered given the new US political landscape and what the ramifications could be.

Whazzup good to also to read your pontifications again. As I told Goatie I simply gave up on the Globe when the Raptors were giving the Cavaliers all they could handle and the deranged 18 hour a day agitating troll came in with several of his clown moniker trolls and ruined the site for about a dozen dedicated Raptor fans. The Globe has over the years lost hundreds and hundreds of subscribers by allowing agitating trolls to dominate sites such as this. Obviously a founding father of confederation and founding father of the Globe and Mail, namely George Brown is rolling over the grave as he watches the current leadership of this once grand old paper sink faster than the titanic.

"The second time I read the article is even worse than the first. Please don't make the same mistake as me. Just read it once and then put your phone into a blender and set on high.

I PROMISE you they didn't shoot at him for ignoring commands and trying to flee and I promise that Troopers didn't say that. I don't have a journalism degree but try this out instead ""Havens and Somerville fired shots at Justin Smith before 4 a.m. Sunday after he fired a gun at them and their K-9.""

Sometimes it seems like Trump is playing Colbert, pretending to be a hypocritical moronic jackass completely lacking in self awareness just to expose how absurd Republicans can really be. The idea that Republicans just follow along and support whatever he does, no matter the hypocrisy or absurdity, was exactly what Colbert was attempting to expose. What is funny is that many Republicans believed Colbert at first, thinking he was on their side. Trump could be playing this role in an attempt to crush the GOP for decades.He wanted to expose them as fools and tools that should not be allowed to govern.(Obamacare replacement LOL) It that was his plan, he is doing a really good job, because that is exactly what is happening.	1

"The victimization metality robs indians of agency and responsibility, perpetuating the cycle of indian abuse and dependence. ""Colonization"" becomes an easy excuse rather than taking responsibility. It's not odd that indians never talk about the significant problems that they faced before the europeans came. Lacking a written language that most other cultures had long since developed makes it convenient for indians to promote the false narrative of the noble savage and the bad effects of colonization. There is more evidence that the indians would've become extinct than there is that they are ultimately worse off since the europeans came. Regardless, Canadians can do very little to solve the Indians' problems. It's time for the indians to look within to solve them, or fully integrate into Canadian society."	0

What he means to say, if he's honest--is that Rs care deeply about jobs, but it's insane to think that job security is justification not to reduce an unsustainable budget. Furthermore, Walker's veto of 1/2 our dividend cost thousands of jobs, but to Cole those job losses are ""justified""-- less important because they aren't part of the elite public sector. What he should be discussing is how many kids are home-schooled in Alaska, and WHY, and how much savings to taxpayers this achieves. It's laughable, and revealing, that Cole believes the majority of Alaskans don't want further cuts to government. On the contrary, most us want to compare line-by-line our cost per resident to the nation's second-highest per capita budget. But alas, this would be too embarassing."	0

I should have gave myself time to respond so I wouldn't be lead by my emotions so forgive me. If there are executives at Red Cross who aren't being good stewards over the money hard working people sacrifice to give in order to help others than shame on them.

I hope Red Cross executives want to find themselves worthy of their calling. The hearts of those serving the people should be reflected in the boardrooms. There is a disconnect when management lives on Wall Street. There are many with hands out in the name of charity. Look at Good Will... we take our stuff to them to sell and they keep the money.

I don't know how or why those candidates were not selected to participate in the forum but perhaps judgment on these decisions made by RACC are jumping to a baseless conclusion.

Nope. Just answered that above here. We can nail this turd with large MOAB's. They will be direct strikes, and lethal to all of his operations and tunnels. We don't need nukes to shut him down. He will be 90% wiped out within a week. He will have zero coms within a few minutes. Then the deluge will nail the southern border for days to wipe out most of the tunnels. SKorea will take some hits in the first hours, but we will destroy all of those tunnels and caves. They are old and will be easy to take out with bunker busters. His missiles will be useless after that. Carpet bombing will wipe him out. I think this guy is vastly overrated. He will be getting it from all sides, from SKorea and Japan as well. Somebody should just take him out from China and all of this will be done with. We are there waiting for him with 3 carriers, the subs, and the air power from Guam, Japan, etc. This guy is making a huge mistake.	0

Well Gary, you've nailed it perfectly; it's what you and I learned in kindergarten, back when things made some sense. Likely we'll never return to civil sanity. Everybody has their own take on what's moving us closer to stupid, so I'll proffer mine: Trump promised everything that populists dreamed of. He was supposed to lose, but didn't. This created a real delimna for the true power brokers, so they had a little chat with the cheeto-in-chief, outlining how things were going to be...showed him a few photos of JFK's soire through Dallas, and an agreement was struck.

I hate to be harsh, but Kim Whitaker seems a little naive in expecting support from Sen. Sullivan. A major campaign promise of the Republican Party has been to take health care away from millions of middle and low income Americans so it can give tax breaks to wealthy individuals (much of the money for the Affordable Care Act comes from a tax on individuals earning more than $200,000, or couples earning more than a quarter million dollars per year). That's the whole point of their effort to repeal the ACA. It's commendable of Sen. Murkowski that she states that will she will vote to prevent cuts to Medicaid recipients, but it remains to be seen if Sen. Sullivan has the sense moral obligation needed to defy his party.	0

You can disregard two-thirds the comments that follow any article on Trudeau. They come from sycophants to the right or left. One ridiculous comment - since removed - came from a poster who branded Trudeau a dictator who wanted to take over the country. Do these people think we have no memory - that we've totally forgotten the Harper's disdain for democracy and contempt for the rule of law? Warts and all, the present government is superior to the one it replaced. Mind you, that's damning with faint praise given the moral bankruptcy of the former. Being marginally better than Harper is not the aspiration or standard Canadians had expected of Trudeau. Most expected much more. And against that measure, I think we have every reason to be disappointed. Some missteps can be put down to well intentioned naivety. Not so the small business assault, tax avoidance, conflict of interest controversies that smack of arrogance and hypocrisy. They amount to a poke in the eye of the electorate.	1

This is pretty standard today. The cost of mechanic labour is high - the cost of parts manufacture labour is low (because it is in China, India, etc).

The skill is lost. Look for a high quality aftermarket part with a decent warranty rather than OEM.	0

Good on Curry. Too often this man has used (black) people as props.

Sometimes we need to admit that some beliefs are not compatible with the West. Certain part of the world are still living in the middle ages where they believe in slavery and women as possessions. What we fail to understand is that that particular belief system never stopped their expansion but it was only slowed down a few century ago. The west almost lost with the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire, Greece was under the Ottoman Empire 4 centuries and that not far from Italy. Spain was also Isamic and if you study that , it meant Europe was being squeezed on two sides. It was Germany, Spain,France , Poland that stood against the complete fall of the Christianity and the evolution of our western values.

Singling out the great Sir John A. misses the point that he was only one over the centuries involved in the white colonization of Canada. If we follow the ETOF logic to its rational conclusion, the name of any town, building, street or park named after a white politician from the days of Champlain to the present will have to be expunged and changed. That does not leave any names of the white colonizers to use. What is to be done then? Perhaps we should introduce a system of numbering all the changed names with a code? Would than make ETOF happy?

Canadians in general and their governments in particular are very naive about this topic, largely owing to an atrophied sense of sovereignty and a difficulty in dealing with the more than ever actual fact that, in the US, Canadians are just like any other foreigners. Any country, as large as the US or as small as Norway, that has any success in retaining value-adding jobs, understands very well that direct intervention in fostering sovereign industrial capabilities is a must and that entrepreneurs given state assistance can't just sell their businesses to the first foreigner who dangles cash in front of them. The flip side of this is that the state must provide opportunities for those entrepreneurs to sell to the state, very often in high technology areas such as IT, cyber, defense and aerospace. Our federal government appears to have a lack of purpose and unity on this since it now appears ready to procure used, second-hand foreign goods for our defense rather than Buying Canadian.	0

The FBI is suppose to be a independent agency but then again so is the media and we all know how that has worked out. If Hillary had gotten elected instead of Trump, how long do you think he would have lasted? The Dems opinions shift like the wind, which ever it happens to be blowing at any given time. It was only a matter of time before he got ousted anyways.	0
You know nothing. And you have supported your accusation with more accusations. You don't know me, what I believe, or how I feel (and the truth would likely surprise you). I am not trying to avoid my position because I stand by it. And, whether you like it or not, my comments are based on observable facts not on any feelings of superiority nor did I disparage any specific group. So your charges of racism are unfounded and an emotional, knee-jerk response. But if burying your head in the sand works for you, keep it up. Good luck with all that.	0
Thanks for your false equivalence statement.....and I am not a great supporter of selecting a mixed group,of folks in an unscientific way and interviewing them....NCR has done this before and as Monica noted in the prior case you simply have 7 opinions of individuals. period.... I can go to the grocery store and find 7 similarly aged folks....and if interviewed that's all I would have 7 opinions. Really wish the NCR would use professional methods or just skip this scenario.	0
And what would have happened had the minority agreed sir? They would have tapped earnings reserves..which are used to inflation-proof the permanent fund the fund unless I`m mistaken. I think your dodging my point.. they would first, before any revenue fixes or subsidy holidays, raid the fund`s earnings (with a token offer of 35 million to buy their votes) before raising a dime in taxes or stopping the oil subsidies. That doesn`t balance the budget my friend Helgason.. Just gets us broke sooner with no savings..no fiscal plan, and the cartel on the slope in the catbird seat and running the show in Juneau thanks to conflict and illegal redistricting parameters. No thanks. You either have a plan and can expound on it or you don`t. The Governor and many in the legislature agree a plan is vital going forward in order to not risk our savings or our credit rating. You know, not company BS, real things.	0

"Paul, there is no reason to be unsure. The AK Supreme Court ruling confirmed a few things. There is no individual right to a Dividend. The PF Earnings are State Income - Period. There is no dedicated fund for the Dividend. Now the Socialists want to maintain funding for the Dividend by imposing a broad based tax. This is prohibited by Article 9, Paragraph 6 of the Alaska Constitution. There will be no tax until the Dividend is ended or radically changed in structure to become a legitimate government purpose. What is a ""legitimate government purpose? One that is not taxed by the IRS as ""Income"". Otherwise the Dividend becomes simply an Income Redistribution Scheme. Having said all that I believe if we end the Dividend we should use some of the savings to boost legitimate government programs to assist the less fortunate people at the lower end of the income spectrum. I am also not opposed to an income tax. In fact I prefer it to the often suggested State sales tax. DividENDit!"	0
Twitter could definitely be an important tool.

"Okay so... I'm not really interested in an argument, but here goes. Those ""Indians"" are actually native Americans, and the land they are purposing to build this hotel on, was actually their land before it was taken from them and they were forced onto a very small reservation. Those ""Indians"" have been working to establish a business with their tribe. They make money in plenty of ways, they have a health and dental clinic, mental health clinic, drug and alcohol counseling, a gas station, fish and wildlife, and a casino that likely brings in quite a bit of revenue. Why does it matter where they get the money? They are trying to help build a better economy in this town and all you ever do is bitch about the ""Indians"". They are native Americans trying to bring back the beauty to our waterfront."	1
Whatever.

If a demented criminal who hates you and has the both the means and opportunity to kill you after repeatedly threatening to do so; you do not terminate the threat before it kills you, then you are partly to blame. I get tired of explaining a firm grasp of the obvious over and over and over and over again.

Good luck to you, Risque.	1
As electricity consumption continues to fall throughout North America, energy surpluses are becoming a greater problem. Ontario typically exports around 15 TWh of electricity at low (or negative) prices each year and is curtailing further TWh of available power. We could easily fuel most of the light vehicles in the Province with surplus electricity at minimal cost. In addition, it takes relatively small amounts of solar to power an EV. For example, our 10 kW rooftop solar system has produced around 100,000 kWh over the seven years since it was installed, while our driving 140,000 electrically powered km has only used around 30,000 kWh. EVs are so efficient that they will not pose a serious problem to the power grid and can help to stabilize the grid by providing dispatchable power demand (and potentiality dispatchable power supply).	0

When Obama assumed office he inherited two wars, the world economy was in freefall, and the GOP, rather than cooperate with the president to confront the terrifying problems beleaguering the republic, embarked on a 24/7 political crusade to sabotage his administration. Obama spent his political capital on stabilizing the economy from its worst crash since the Depression, health care reform, and a slew of initiatives to benefit the middle class. Prosecution of Bush and Cheney would have been a suicide mission. It's ludicrous to accuse Obama of signing on to PNAC. History will decide if Obama's decision to reverse course on American interventionism and pull back in Syria was the right one. Obama considers it among his best.	0
"Dershowitz is a smart guy, but the above is illustrative of the maxim that a carpenter sees every problem as a protruding nail to be hammered down. Dershowitz is the dean of Constitutional scholars. However, in the analysis of factual situations for criminality, it is settled that one should consider every other factor before only as a last resort turning to Constitutional arguments. In this case Criminal Law I disposes of the issue. The Rule of Lenity therein is a rule of construction for criminal and quasi-criminal laws and regulations. It provides that if a criminal law or reg is susceptible of more than one reasonable reading, the reading most favorable to the defendant will be adopted. This is a rule well supported by the Supreme Court. It is perhaps an extension of the rule that an ambiguous agreement is construed against the drawer and has some ""due process of law"" element in it, too. - Winthrop Drake Thies, NYC"	0

Too simplistic alg1. There are about 65 million refugees in the world, displaced from their homes. What is Canada's duty to those 65 million. There are tens of millions more living in poverty and horrid conditions so extreme, in their home countries, they are literally dying from it. How many more people would leave their home countries, if they could be assured of a supportive welcome, and enter Canada as an economic refugee? Twenty million? A hundred million? How big should our welcome mat be? Believing we should have controls and quotas is not being racist or selfish.	0
"Why are lies working for Trump? Because they also work for the media. That's show business. An entertaining President Trump with his whopper lies and his scary bigotry is pure gold for media ratings. And pure gold for Trump's popularity with his base. The unemployment rates are a real whopper: “as high as 35 down to 4.7 per cent in the space of a few weeks."" It's such a huge glaring lie it's like Big Brother saying 2 + 2 = 5. Does anybody really care except some in the hand-wringing public? The media doesn't care. Orwell's book ""1984"" is one of the best sellers of all time. It's great for newspaper circulation. His base doesn't care. They're entertained by getting away with lies to prove that the media lies as well. It's a 1984 Big Brother dystopia with a cynical humorous twist (Remember Lyin Brian Mulroney in the real 1984!?) Anything to distract from continual drift to the right wing, continual war, continual global economy profits, continual income disparities."	0
"This situation in looking for a new leader for DOE hearkens back to another episode in which there was a search for a new leader of a department. Sure, there was a selection committee set up, a number of names brought forward, and a ""evaluation"" if you will of each of the candidates happened. All the while, throughout the process, whispers became low mumbles saying that one of the candidates was already chosen, and that all this ""evaluation"" was part of the kabuki theater to be sure the masses felt everyone was given a fair shake. And then, lo and behold, the person which everyone said was ""in"" got chosen! Later on, more grumbling in that people said the person was already targeted for being chosen even before the selection team was chosen. That person was Louis Kealoha, HPD Chief until last month. Good thing that KL Castle had enough chutzpah to call this selection process out and yank the resources. Otherwise it would have happened all over again, with the same results."	0

My husband and I have been researching the safety of the push-button or fingerprint activated safes; some can be defeated by a determined child, so that is our paramount concern. We've discussed our plans in case anything like this happens again (checking before we go inside, escape routes, etc.) and our first response would be to try to leave the house rather than to engage someone. IF the worst happens though, I'd like to be prepared. We would retreat to a room that locks, where we'd locate the quicker-opening safe. I'll admit I am not a big fan of guns, but my husband has taken me out shooting a number of times, I've taken some safety courses, and I have surprised myself by being a pretty good shot. He's in charge of cleaning everything, because it is an involved process. I try not to go places where I feel like I would need to carry one, but if I had to (emergency, wilderness trip gone bad), I hope I'd be prepared. We don't take it lightly.	0

"At the risk of further feeding an ignorant resident-TROLL -- you were born an omnivore you pathetic MORON. Why do you think you have canine-teeth and incisors? If you were a vegetarian you would be born with ruminant stomachs so you could upchuck your cud to chew on during the late-late show; or practice coprophagy like many rabbits and other smaller herbivores do (that's eating your own feces in order to garner enough nutrients out of a vegan diet, they need to ingest the proteins formed by the bacteria that try to digest their own feces); if you don't do either of those things then you're going to suffer brain damage. (I think we're witnessing your final brain-damage melt-down. LOL) So the next time that someone yells at you, ""EAT SH**!

One suspects it won't be long before a large portion of those who voted for Trump, along with the 46% who didn't vote at all, come to realization they were had. If Trump's 'new deal' for America serves anyone's interests other than his own, that will have been strictly incidental.

Is anyone surprised that it was the Republican party that foisted their less-than-fit candidate upon the nation? They've been extremists for a long time. Their choice in Trump reveals they'd put anybody in the office as long as he was willing to undertake their extremist agenda. Trump is the epitome of today's racist Republicans. His agenda is the summation of what Republicans stood for for decades. First and foremost, they are women-haters and racists. Now they've exposed themselves as neo-Nazis to boot.	1

Hearing him talk to one of his many nannies who took his daughters to the beach with a bunch of friends and asking repeatedly if they were being touchy feely and flirty is creepy! He kept encouraging the nanny to give them alone time to play. Seriously?!?! Snitz is single for a reason. If you date him, you date his friends too.

Actually, at $1 litre of gas, your costs for a 20 000 watt diesel generator to run 24 hours a day is around 45 dollars a day times 30 = $1350 a month which is much less than the $2000 Hydro bill displayed in this article. It's time to cut the power cord.	0

As a bellweather- when The Beach Boys played for free on the D.C. Mall on the 4th holiday the new secretary of the interior James Watts had a fit . He was a fundementalustbwho also believed the end days were coming. Then President Reagan rejected his opinion and later with a push from the president he either resigned or was removed. The tragedy of all of this is the lives destroyed or radically changed in both the religion and political sphere.Is an irreparable loss in many ways. Dialogue without rancor still needs to be accomplished though with an end of days type of thinking the difficulties are immense. It's like pondering what would have happened if Lincoln was able to complete his last term of office. Both sides might have been helped and grave mistakes avoided.	0

Oh yeah, throw in a relatively few bucks (tax deductible!) so they can maintain a facade of good citizenry. Deplorable.	0

Not surprising. As a parent my first experience (as an adult) in their store was babies'r'us. Staffed by people who have no interest or knowledge of baby products (fun shopping). Their inventory system was non-existent, staff would have to look around the entire backroom (no organization) to find that the item that showed 3 in stock was in fact not in stock. This happened to us multiple times but was particularly shocking when it was a crib! Those don't just walk out the door and we went to 3 different Babies'r'Us stores before just buying whatever they found in the back because inventory systems were all wrong. Tried several stores across provinces, same experience. I still buy toys and baby gifts in a store, not on amazon. But they lost my business long ago. If I need a wide selection of cheap crap I can hit up Walmart, otherwise I go to a local toy or baby store with pleasant staff.	1
That's my biggest objection to this stupid idea, which simply will not die.

You would have to be a cold hearted jerk, like the author of this article, to not feel sorry for the more than 100,000 people who have been laid off. Gary, also probably doesn't know, since he is sitting up in his ivory tower, that layoffs are continuing despite the 4.6% growth (I personally know over 20 people who have been let go over the last 3 months). Albertans are not mad because of the world price of oil, which we all know is out of our control, but the price we get - which is the lowest in the world. If other provinces and the federal government were actually supportive of the pipelines that would help increase the price we get, there wouldn't be so much anger. Imagine if Harper had set downstream emission review on the auto industry as a part of the bail out or if the current PM said that the lumber industry does not need any protection from the US duties. I bet people from Ontario and BC would be upset, and with good reason.	1

Did it ever occur to you that not every human being is the same, and pumping breastmilk takes a whole lot of work. Not every mom can nurse their child, as some children prefer the bottle. In other news, many moms work! I was told to throw out my breastmilk at DIA just yesterday for the same reason, and was forced to take off of work today because I do not have milk to send to daycare with my child. Producing a full bottle with the pump is NOT easy. Learn some empathy and be willing to be understanding of others' situations, even if you have not experienced them yourself. Especially as a man, making a really dumb comment that is incredibly offensive to the women who really have to work for every drop!	0

"@Bob C56: I do not see this as a left-right. We just had a centre-right government (who I voted for in the past) who helped author this mess, with all kinds of interfering policies/cronyism that only exacerbated our affordability issues. We need is a frank discussion that begins by acknowledging: 1) conflicts of interest that exist for anyone who owns real estate in BC when it comes to crafting policy on real estate. No one should apologize for owning, but if people had million $ holdings in any other sector where they might craft policy, it would be a HUGE deal. and 2) that the real estate market is the most interfered-with market out there. Thus, people need to stop crying ""interference"" any time a new policy measure that might work against high prices is discussed. If the market was freer - if banks had to shoulder all lending risk and special tax treatments (capital gains exemptions, property tax deferrals, the crazy ""HOME"" loan program, etc.) - it would crater."	0

The junk food you &/or openwater2010 &/or your obese friends & relatives eat is FAR more damaging&deadly than cannabis, whether smoked or vaped,could ever be. Obesity related diseases (heart & liver disease, stroke, cancers, diabetes2)kill as many Canadians each year as does tobacco, i.e. a staggering 40K+ Canadians killed easch year by obesity.All illicit drugs combined plus non-illicit medical cannabis could never come close to causing such carnage. But it's cannabis (& probably opioids, cocaine, meth, etc.) you insist should be demonized, instead!? That's very just&rational of you (not).Btw, the most dangerously impairing popular drug isn't crack,meth, pot,E, or LSD. It's good, old legal alcohol(think accidents&violence).Booze also causes multiple deadly diseases dreaded illicit drugs do not cause.If we're going to ban substances based on harm caused, surely we should focus first on the most damaging ones of all: our legal ones, tobacco, booze,& junk food, shouldn't we?

This response from Trump is just more and the same of his immature narcissistic personality. Our current health care system does not just cover democrats. His repeal and replace did not pass because Republicans didn't vote for it. I thinks this fine Christian president would just as soon see people lose coverage and watch them die then to participate in options that would further stabilize the current system. Medicare Medicaid is the way to go. It is the only system that has any control on the rising costs of care and medication.That old saying that something is worth what someone is willing to pay for it is an idea who's time has come.

While I agree with the sentiment of resilience in the face of danger, that does not mean that flowerpots on bombed-out windowsills are any kind of answer to a problem that needs (and has) a solution. When addressing the problem of terrorism among Islamic fundamentalists, how about instead of focusing on painting pretty pictures of resilience, preaching all these delusional mantras, virtue-signaling to each other & the whole western word. Instead of all this smug self-satisfaction coming from the directly unaffected, how about we take a good, hard look at the root-cause of the problem and attempt to & determine what exactly is providing the impetus and the basis for these extreme actions.Why don't we address the problem of Islamic ideology viewed as from a the perspective of rigid fundamentalism that is at the heart of these terrorist attacks?

I will repeat the actual fact that you are wrong. There are more than just two ex cathedra decrees. I named two others. I also told you where you could find a collection of them all. See, I’m backing up my facts with evidence. You are relying purely upon your foolish pride. I have also explained to you the difference between de fide dogmata and ex cathedra dogmata. It’s called “theological certainty.” You seem to imply, erroneously, that ex cathedra dogma is superior in some way to de fide dogmata. Consider that you actually stated that the Church does not teach that Christ ordained the 12 Apostles. I provided you with the canons from the Council of Trent with made it clear that Christ both instituted the sacrament of Holy Orders at the Last Supper, and that He ordained the 12 Apostles at the very same time. You have been proven wrong in every one of our disagreements, but through your foolish pride, you will not admit it. Women can never, ever be validly ordained, period.	0
"It is increasingly evident that the power of the presidency is now in the hands of a neo-Nazi -- Steve Bannon. Trump is little more than a figurehead, a useful, albeit sometimes embarrassing, idiot who dances to the tunes Bannon plays. Those who supported Trump , or gave him a pass, as he waged a relentlessly racist campaign and watched as he built a government of oligarchs and incompetents, need to find the courage and integrity to oppose him. That includes the bishops of the United States who, as a conference and in many cases individually, have been absent from this battle, or worse on the wrong side of it. As Susan Rice has so succinctly, eloquently and correctly said of the promotion of Bannon to the National Security Council, and the marginalization of the patriots and experts who belong there, this is ""stone cold crazy."" Our bishops should find the integrity to be as clear as Rice. So should the Republicans. So should we all."	1

"Prime Minister Tater Tot campaigned on the promise to keep annual deficits the first two years of his government under $10 billion (2016-17 and 2017-18). NOPE. And he confirmed that last February saying that the current deficit would be $30 billion. A National Bank of Canada report last February said the country's fading economic prospects could put the Liberal government on track for $90 billion in deficits over its four-year mandate. As recently as mid-December 2015 he insisted that the Liberal plan to make good on the key balanced-budget promise (return to a balanced budget in 2019) was ""very"" cast in stone. He has now disavowed that campaign vow to balance the public books before the end of his government's four-year mandate — a pledge that was central to the Liberal election platform. Well at least we have electoral reform... oh wait."	0

To date, it appears that the Trump campaign team acted inappropriately but that (a) proof that inappropriate actions were by (or authorized by) Trump personally are lacking & (b) while inappropriate, such actions were probably not illegal. On the other hand, grounds are becoming apparent for a case that Trump personally while in office as President directly attempted to interfere with the administration of justice. (which would be grounds for impeachment by the House of Representatives leading to a trial by the Senate to determine whether he should be removed from office.	0

Stories about things like, ""big, beautiful walls"" or ""barbaric cultural practice hotlines"" are hard to report on, I imagine, without injecting some opinion.

". . . The South is prohibiting US military agression toward NK. Understandably, it does not want war on the Penninsula.

No one will let you do what you threaten. . . . not even your own defense secretary, NSA chief or Chief of staff. . . You're full of it!. . . Check out this test. . ."" There are two ways to look at the position Trump has placed the US with his ignorant bluster. Either we engage in catastrophic war, or officially back off on the long standing official position that NK has to de-nuclearize. Those are really the only two options. Both make NK stronger. And, Iran is watching, so it's refusing inspections of its nuclear activity. And, Russia is doing wargames in East and Northern Europe. Trump is a disaster. He's really screwed the pooch. He empowered NK."	1
Maikiki123, Trump did suggest the Civil War might have been avoided if Andrew Jackson had been around to stop it. He wasn’t around and the Civil War started. That is the point Trump made.

You're mistaken. It is illegal under US law to solicit or to accept the assistance of a foreign power, directly or indirectly. Furthermore, one cannot meet with officials of a foreign government to negotiate terms without the authorization of the US government. Don't say the Russian lawyer's promise of dirt on Clinton was nothing. It is exactly the kind of collusion the Trump campaign has denied doing. It describes a quid pro quo arrangement which is definitely illegal. And aren't we much closer to seeing Trump as Putin's poodle? Trump complained in tweets that Obama didn't punish the Russians enough over the meddling. Then Trump wants to forgive and forget. Then he even wants to share US cyber-secrets with the Kremlin. Sheesh! If you're so pro-Russian that you don't see how treasonous this is, then I can only assume you're a Russian troll.	1

"The couple in this article who are complaining about the ""rich"" people who are on cruises are assuming that the people on cruises live this way all the time.

He was a lumber inspector; but because he and his wife saved throughout his working years they have a comfortable retirement. Also, I don't agree with the lady who is lost most of the money in her retirement account, but is not blaming it on her inept boss.

I will give you a star for that one...you are right, I do believe that most children born here of immigrant parents become full on Canadians. And I have many that are friends and I am grateful to know them.  The issue is with numbers coming in all at once (Canada has grown by 5 million since 2011 and most by immigrants) and the fact many now seek out their own and are creating communities wholly from the culture they left. You see that with the recent firestorm in the Tamil community in the GTA that wanted their candidate to run for the Liberals and the libs were intervening. The truth was the Tamils just wanted a Tamil as their MP; when you get down to it, it is anti-Canadian and until we can slow down the numbers this nonsense will continue to happen. People seem to think that generational Canadians are the ones being racist when it comes to immigrants. But it is in fact both ways, but mostly with the immigrants themselves. Could we get away with this in their country?	0

You can convince the central banker not to run for the Liberal Party of Canada leadership but you can’t take the Liberal Party leadership contender out of the central banker. Carney was pleased as punch that London was “Europe’s premier centres [he meant to say “centre”] for Islamic and green finance”. He and his accomplices won’t work for a responsible and open financial system, they will “work tirelessly for a responsible and open financial system that benefits all”. I know he takes a break from work now and then because he ran the London Marathon in 2015, so I am not sure what “tirelessly” means here. He wants Britain to take the high road, not the low road. What if the people who take the low road get to Scotland before him?	0
Imago Dei & Pastor McKinley believe that gay sex is sinful and that gays do not deserve the protections that come with legal marriage. That is treating them as second class citizens. My friend Jason's love for his husband means nothing to Pastor McKinley, yet Jason's love for his husband is very much part of who Jason is. Please source Pastor McKinley saying something in support of equality between a gay couple and a hetero married couple. It has to be specific to homosexuality- I am not gonna accept some punt from the New Testament about loving everyone. I want McKinley saying that gays are equal.	1

"When are many of the people of Alaska and ESPECIALLY THE IDIOTS IN THE PRESS going to get their heads out of their asses and quit saying stupid things like ""Alaska GAVE money to Alaskans"". Consider these points, you idiots: 1) If the CEO of CIRI told the OWNERS of THAT COMPANY that he was going to keep half of the annual dividend - OBLIGATED BY LAW to be disbursed - without the agreement of the Board of Directors, HE WOULD GO TO JAIL. 2) The Permanent Fund is a fund OWNED by the PEOPLE of Alaska. The PEOPLE of Alaska ALLOW the government of Alaska to MANAGE THEIR MONEY. If the fund makes SUFFICIENT PROFIT, the managers are OBLIGATED BY LAW to disburse a PORTION of that PROFIT to the OWNERS! 3) ""The government"" doesn't ""give"" me MY MONEY any more than a bank ""gives"" me MY MONEY when I withdraw from my savings, checking, OR INVESTMENTS.

It could be that Syngenta still wants to keep their hand in on the GMO seed business but will now contact out the actual seed growing to Hartung or they may use Hartung to test out their newer herbicides/pesticides they are developing or have already developed as many countries have moved to ban or restrict the use of herbicides such as Roundup and various pesticides. The ironic thing about Syngenta which was a Swiss Company is that they were banned from using the herbicides and pesticides in Switzerland which they were testing and using here in Hawaii.

"This is a welcome respite from political opportunism. The existence of tax-funded Catholic schools is a vestige of our bi-national history, not a principle of public education. It was designed to allow French-language education in majority-English provinces, where, by tradition alone, the francophones would expect such schools to be run by the Church. Which of course, is now an anachronism. The issue in public education is language of instruction, not religion of teachers, curriculum, or students. Catholic schools recruiting non-Catholics today is the height of hypocrisy. There was a reason why Catholic education was officially called ""separate"" in Ontario -- it was partly to accommodate Franco-Ontarians, and to keep the English-Catholic students away from the Heretic Protestants."	0

Gary Mason, congratulations on a grand slam opinion piece! Successive federal governments have put a blind eye to the roots of this housing cost insanity that has displaced so many 'reside and pay taxes in Canada', Canadians. Yes we want foreign investment and investment from immigrants but we have a monster on our hands. Real estate boards, provincial governments, loophole lawyers and special interests have done their part to make housing so unaffordable and out of sync with wages. Insane housing prices hurts quality of life, birthrates and the economy. Guess what, it will not get better. Do you know how much money is out there that wants a 'home' in a safe haven? These are really complex issues but we won't deal with them until we face them. Governments won't face them until they HAVE to. We Canadians are wonderfully tolerant, kind and understanding. We can be NICE and ANGRY. I think that's what's needed. Write letters and pressure your government representatives now.	0

So is it still a source of great entertainment watching America trying to deal with illegals and are Americans still racists because of it?

The funds didn't make it to Chaclacayo, like I said they wouldn't, unless Tina can prove otherwise. It has been prove she donated our goods to a different town, Chosica, to a place her friend runs, and she left our sister city out of the transaction...hmmm. I smell a rat.	1

According to one of my sons who is at DOT, DOT engineers are studying the pavement surface technology itself as a remedy for the effects of studs. There is some hope that improved surface technology may not only resist the wear of studs put have other positive effects.

Excellent article Mr. Jenkins. What stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Chicago with the strongest anti gun laws in the country has dozens of people shot on any weekend, more than any other city in the country. May be they need to have stricter laws? The loudest calls for gun control comes from powerful hypocrite people who are surrounded by armed guards and private security. Hillary Clinton, Jimmy Kimmel, and all the others are protected by guns. The average joe must rely on himself. If the next mass murderer uses a Kenworth semi truck to crash into a crowd, not one person will suggest banning Kenworth trucks, require smaller engines, or slower gears. If the next mass murderer uses a chainsaw, not one person will suggest licensing chainsaws and limiting the bar length. Day after day, law abiding Americans use guns to protect their families and property. Leave it that way.	0

"Les, there appears to be a moral and patriotic vacuum chamber within the whitehouse, extending out to the first family. The false statements to the press (that they keep on stepping into), the backdrop of intentional conspiratorial interaction with America's biggest and longest enemy, and continuous rationalization of the two. Clear demonstrations of a lack of morals and a lack of patriotism. ""Clinton"" has nothing to do with it. Trying to overlay ""Clinton"" by just mentioning her/his name in order to distract from the festering problem in our Executive Branch is moronic at this point, considering the breath and scope of what is being revealed. Will we let this become normal, business as usual behavior for an American Presidency? I hope not. But, what is really troubling is that there are those in the public who seem to support such behavior. Why? Who knows. Unless there too is a vacuum of morality and patriotism."	0
"""Given the health risks and negative reaction from health professionals and the idiotic comments from the supporters this is just an insult to one's intelligence to think it's anything other than votes"". Heard about a study on CBC yesterday where in 2016 there were 77,000 hospital stays at an average cost of $8,000/ea to the Canadian taxpayer for alcohol related hospitalization. It's an insult to ones intelligence that one can take such a cynical view of cannabis legalization while ignoring the harm that legal alcahol is doing to this country."	1

"Ms. Wilder has ""grievances against the Republican Party"" and won't vote for another Republican. Her grievances: 1. Republicans have not declared war against ISIS. Because Democrats can't agree on how broad the war powers should be. 2. By not holding hearings on the Supreme Court nominee, the Court is ""hamstrung"". Hearings don't confirm Justices. Since Scalia died, the Court decided 9 cases. Three were decided 8-0. One decided 7-1. One decided 6-2. One by 4-3 (Kagan recused). Two ties but unlikely to have had a different result if Scalia were alive. 3. Delay of Loretta Lynch confirmation vote. Nominated January, 2015, hearings in January. A month to publish record. Two months to review record. Confirmed May 23, 2015. Not much delay. 4. Refused to consider gun control. There were votes on 4 proposals in June. 5. State legislatures vote against LGBT and abortion. Legislatures are different from the U.S. Senate; this is a reach. And Lisa is actually moderate on both issues."	0
Those are not equivalent. The difference is that a prayer room is for actual, you know, believers, to perform a religious ritual of their actual, current, religious belief. It is a mini mosque, temple, church, etc. The crucifix in the Quebec N.A. is an historical artefact reflective of Quebec's cultural heritage, which does not reflect current religious beliefs or rituals of Quebecers any more than having the fleur-de-lys on the flag represents current belief in loyalty to the King of France. Insisting on destroying traces of one's religious past in the name of current secularism should be as abhorrent as the destruction of monuments of past religions by ISIS, or France destroying Notre Dame Cathedral or Chartres in the name of secularism. Ironically, Catholicism is a crucial part of the culture of Quebec, because that is what people rebelled against. I personally don't care whether it stays or goes, but I object to the mischaracterization of what it represents.	0

"Yes, people are ultimately responsible for their own actions, however, yelling 'fire' in a crowded theatre or 'wolf', as Nancy Pelosi recently said, can cause panic and people being injured or even killed in an attempt to escape. The old radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"" by Orson Wells, and the subsequent panic it caused is a perfect example of how powerful the media was way back in 1938 and still is today. That power must be tempered with self control and discernment. If they can't do that, then they've become part of the problem and not the solution."	0

Silly man. Rail can not fill 400 tankers , no matter how many times Albertans wish it. Try to get the BC perspective. We don't care about pipelines, so long as they don't fill 400 tankers which threaten 200,000 coastal jobs. No tankers. No one care about pipelines, build all you want.	1

"""I can't show you in the New Testament a separated clergy, a clerical class"" Yes - we do agree on this. What you appear not to acknowledge, is that the current dispute between the GC and some Union and Local conferences, regards the ordination of a clerical class of NON-local ""elders"" that did not exist in the NT, but was introduced later by Protestant churches as a replacement for the Ordained Priesthood of the Orthodox churches. Present GC Working Policy explicitly allows Divisions to authorize election and ordination of women as Local Elders. GC Working Policy also allows Divisions to Commission (but not Ordain) women as ministers. Under present GC Working Policy, Commissioned Ministers can perform every function of an Ordained Minister save one thing only - they cannot be elected as Conference President. This is the real ""glass ceiling"" in GC Working Policy. Basically you are arguing a different question than the one voted at San Antonio, Annual Council, etc."	0

If I had to choose between listening to a woman or men like him, easy choice."" So , the conclusion is, most or all women will preach like Liu and most or all men will preach like that one man? Most readers here will know this is unfair & illogical. There is a point here though.. Attendance is predominantly related to sermon quality! Does anyone expect SDA women to preach better if they are products of the same higher education as SDA men? Why are so many leaving? WO?? Naaaa SDA homiletics, across the board, are inept & pathetic.

"Nope. Nothing Trump did was even close to being impeachable. Dershowitz, a liberal constitutional expert says that no laws were broken even if Trumps people and the Russians slept together. After a year of investigations, no evidence that they ""colluded"" has been found.

It is all bunk and a distraction that the left has created to cripple the goals of this administration. Simple."	1

It was a special briefing so this important news could be delivered from his highness. via his now court jester it's one thing to refuse to provide information, duck a question or give an opinion -- e.g ""I've heard that the inauguration may have been seen by the most people ever."" -- which would likely have been shrugged off as hyperbole. Instead, a PressSec was told to call a presser with the express intent of delivering FALSE information. Donald J Trump #sizequeen"	1

"Providing information for both sides would not have proven or dis-proven how they could influence the out come.

Western foreign policy is a pathetic excuse for all these Islamist terrorist attacks. If anything western foreign policy has been assisting ISIS and other Islamist terrorists (certainly that has been the case in Syria and Libya). Anyway, ISIS have killed more Muslims than anyone else. They have killed, tortured and brutalized religious and ethnic minorities who have got nothing to do with western foreign policy (Coptic Christians, for example). Their supporters (such as the Manchester suicide bomber and the three Islamist terrorists in London) don't care about foreign policy. They are just angry and frustrated because Islam can't be imposed on western society. That's why they targeted pubs and a pop-concert for young girls. If we have a failed policy it is a failure of integration or domestic assimilation not our foreign policy.	1

I'm saying that the Christian church is full of members, all sincere in their efforts to understand and embrace a value structure based on their sense of God (which I refer to the mythology of God, not because it's false, but because it will always be unprovable). There is great variety of belief in the Christian church. I don't have a litmus test for who qualifies as a Christian and who doesn't, it's not my place to make that judgement. I hope my faith shapes at least some of my social values, but I don't need a flag, or a cross, to justify my opinion. To give credit to my readers, I try to let them know my motivation. As you've noticed, I do have an opinion. I will argue for my beliefs. I don't claim perfect knowledge. I don't claim to speak/write only the truth. I am an imperfect human being, full of mistakes, that believes grace and forgiveness are qualities of both god and the human species. If not, I'm screwed! :-)	1

"Nothing will truly change until the Church comes into the 21st century with its' teachings on human sexuality. The basic message I received growing up in the Catholic Church and attending Catholic schools was that sex equals sin. Masturbation was a sin. Sex before marriage was a sin. Homosexuality was a sin. Extra marital affairs was a sin. The only sexual act that was not a sin was sex between a man and a woman united in holy Matrimony. And even in that case, a child born was born with ""original"" sin. When the Hierarchy saw that many of its' priests were engaged in sexual activity with children how did they see it. Of course, they saw it as sin. Nothing has really changed in the Churches' teaching in the last one hundred years regarding sexuality. If you molest a child, you simply go to confession and have your sins forgiven and go out and sin again."	1

The value of a university education in Canada is clearly in decline, since the universities themselves are accepting racist Liberal doctrine in order to prostitute themselves...they will have to hire professors whose qualifications need not measure up to replace excellence with stupidity in order to meet quotas.

What is the value of an education in an environment when there is a war on excellent professors who happen to be white and male?

I'll do that. You can keep making excuses and ignoring the fact that Siemian's best position on the football field is the sideline with a clipboard in his hands. Eagles running backs averaged 2.56 YPC last night; 64 yards on 25 carries. Sound familiar? Doesn't sound like much for run blocking. Again, Wentz was sacked three times, hit six times and pressured several other times. Sound familiar? Doesn't sound like perfect pass protection. So let's recap. Wentz had a weak running game, was getting pressured, sacked, hit. Still lead his offense to 34 points and completed 68% of his passes with four TD's, and most importantly a Win.	0

"Who would want to be a foster parent? By the time children are apprehended in BC they are so damaged that you would have to have skills that most ""normal"" people do not possess. Combined with the idealogoy of keeping the family together there is the ideology of providing a ""safe"" house. As a retired HR/health care professional with experience in career counseling, I though of taking in foster kids until I was told that it was frowned on to have curfews, rules around chores and school, etc.. Essentially all the practices that help to raise successful children are forbidden. No wonder kids in BC are ""timing out"" of the system with not enough education or life skills to look after themselves. And don't even get me going on leaving children with severely drug addicted parents. I've seen the generational addiction up close and the family reunification policy is to blame.

John I agree that this tax plan is on balance a giveaway to the rich. And, I fear the 'well there's some good ideas in there' arguments because the minor positive elements are well outweighed by the bad elements. However, I think this author is providing some useful information and I agree with her general principle--we should simplify our tax code. What I got from Ms. Carr's essay was that there are some straightforward ways to make the tax code simpler that are not necessarily gifts to the rich. I think she's adding some important nuance here.	0

Plus, like the Church today, the APA was incredibly over focused on gay men which made the APA appear to discriminate when it came to homosexuality. The APA finally bent to three facts.

Second, many of their own came out of the closet and lo and behold they weren't neurotic. Third was the political pressure, but that was given more credence because of numbers one and two.	1
According to the documents of Vatican Two, 'The Priest' of the Diocese is the Bishop. Since he can't be everywhere to minister his functions of leading Liturgy, distributing Sacraments, Preaching and Teaching, and of Administration, the Bishop delegates some of these tasks to others. Theoretically, I suppose he 'could' delegate them to anyone he deemed capable. By custom and subsequent 'Canon Law' most of the tasks were reserved to those who became 'Clerics' – and the requirements for that were laid out in the customs. So also the training required and all the other requirements for such 'offices'. Increasingly many Bishops are delegating some of their 'powers' to 'lay' people. Both men and women have been designated to lead services, administer a parish, teach, and many functions formerly reserved to 'the priest'. It may be through an 'ordination'. Though usually that is considered a 'Sacrament of Orders' required only for 'priests' or 'Deacons'. Most new roles don't require that	0

Mr. Haycox picked and chose his history. Warefare of World War I was foreseen during the Russo-Japanese War. The real horror of World War I came when no one learned from the Russo-Japanese War. That frontal assaults against machine guns will not work well. Nationalism is part of every war and without it, war cannot be won. Even today, without American nationalism, our nation will not win any war. Mr. Haycox knows this to be true because nationalism is what keep the nation in the war to win. Mr Haycox's leftist comments are really, immature and inept as any from the far right. Our nation is singular in its ability to absorbed people from all cultures and lands and make them Americans. Just as Haycox forefathers came from across the Atlantic as mine came across the Pacific. Where Haycox and I differs is that he is ashamed to be proud of our nation and what its represents....and I am not. I am a nationalist....Haycox is not. Haycox want to save the world, I just want to save our nation.	0

Charles, another excellent and important article. The three quasi government state lending agencies staffed by 440 cradle to the grave employees and billions in state assets produce nothing of value to Alaska. These agencies have picked many losers while basking in oil wealth. Only one loser per agency was discussed in this short article but there have been many. The State should not be picking winners or losers. These are powerful agencies with lots of money and manpower and conections to lobby the Boston Firm doing the audit. $800,000,00 will be money really well spent to get the proverbial camels nose under the tent at these agencies. Unfortunately the agencies themselves have offered to pay a lot of the cost of the audit. Again excellent article Mr. Wolhlforth.	0

What are you talking about? This isn't about the Russian people. It is about Putin - the tyrant in charge of the Russian people today. The ex head of the KGB who disappears or has his critics and rivals murdered. The Dictator for life who has invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea. The guy who was responsible for the shoot down of a KLM 747. The man who has written that his goal was the return of the USSR to its original borders. The war criminal who has propped up a bloody dictator and ruthlessly bombed civilians in Syria. The corrupt richest man on the planet whose greatest goal is the destruction of the USA and who has just pulled off the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor. He hacked and attacked us and is spoon feeding talking points to Far Right media sources to keep us fighting each other rather than uniting against him. Praising him is either stupid or traitorous or both. Putin is the problem not the Russian people, just as Trump is the problem not the American people.	1

When it comes to RTD, it's Denver that's heavily subsidized while the suburbs get screwed. Especially with rail. The vast majority of light rail rides start and/or end in Denver (usually downtown or DIA). The suburbs don't even come remotely close to that degree of service, but yet the suburbs pay 77% of the taxes that fund RTD. The tax really ought to be 2x or 3x bigger in the city of Denver and less in the suburbs. Who doen't want a walkable neighborhood? The problem is it often conflicts with so many other things people also want, like less crowding, more open space, yards, big houses, quiet neighborhoods, low crime, safe places for their kids to play, etc. The small town life in a small space works fine when you have 1000 people. But small town life for 3-5 million people requires a helluva lot more space. Which is why suburbs and xburbs exist.	0
"How does an article about walking the Camino ""misguide"" people? Why are you denigrating Fr. Daly's account of what happened to him, both physically and spiritually, on his walk?  Most accounts I have read of walking the Camino stress that having a continuing conversation with God is the main activity while walking, even for those who did not undertake the walk as a religious pilgrimage.  Not everyone can walk the Camino. All may go on a normal retreat, but few do, especially those who are not of a religion that offers retreats. The Camino attracts people of all religions and none. It is simply one of God's ways of bringing people into conversation with God, into awareness of God's presence in our daily lives, even when not removing ourselves from the ""world"" through a retreat or pilgrimage.

We can waste our time micro-analyzing Hillary and describing how we feel about her while forgetting about the elephant in the room who is about to devour us all while we nitpick minutiae. We cannot escape the fact that Trump is a danger to our country and to the whole world if he wins this election. I hope that those who are so immersed in their personal agendas to the extent that they forget the reality of the world around them will wake up. We need Hillary to defeat Trump regardless of whatever shortcomings one may perceive her to have. We cannot afford an unqualified divisive racist xenophobic and impulsive bully at the helm of our government making decisions about Supreme Court appointments, civil liberties, and involving us in foreign wars. As a Bernie supporter, I urge those considering not voting for Hillary to stop deceiving yourselves, be real, and acknowledge that if you don't vote at all or vote for someone other than Hillary, then you are voting for Trump.	0

"What the Commander in Chief or even a Presidential candidate says concerning an ongoing trial for a U.S. Military person isn't any where near the same as ""any individual"". Quite frankly it is irresponsible for somebody in that position to make a judgement statement. The defense (who are military officers, assigned to the case, doing the job tasked to them) were trying to show undue influence in order to get a reduced sentence and represent their charge to the best of their abilities. . I do take great exception to your characterization of Col. Nance. You know nothing of his qualifications or his performance, nor do you have any idea of the reasons why he sentenced the way he did. Besides, do you really think that in a high profile case like this that a U.S. Army Colonel doesn't get a sense of what outcome that Big Green wanted?"	0

And protesting what exactly-that they're in America living better than where they left, all the while getting access to Health Care, Education, etc?

This is a good example of how you can spin with statistics. What is most relevant to the question of his contribution to the team's making the playoffs at this point is not that he has hit .240 all year, but that he has hit .301 in the last 30 games. If he can keep that up and get his power up just a bit, he could be the difference maker. 31 is hardly washed up. He COULD have many productive years left. Would be great if they could work out a contract that has lots of incentives to encourage him to stay. But then again, if he doesn't perform, thats still a lot of money and a roster position that he ties up. To tell you the truth, what I like about him as much as anything, is who he is. Of course, I don't know know him, but he seems like a real stand up guy. Bottom line is that it is a business and a player only has a certain period of productivity. So, while both sides need to look out for their business interests, Cargo will and should have more of a sense of urgency.	0

How could the authors of this article possibly know the academic qualifications of the illegals in the States. We have provinces that are all up to there ears in debt. We have high unemployment across the country, and most provinces are predicting minimal growth for the next number of years. The major cities where most current immigrants, and refugees go , have out of sight housing costs. So before we get on this drive to open our borders and let everyone in, let's see a study on the 40 thousand Syrians we have taken in. How are they doing financially etc, and what has the cost been for the government ? We have a very high unemployment rate for the 20 to 30 year old demographic. Why would it be any different for a migrant from Africa ? How many service jobs at the present time are available ? What skill levels does anyone think the economic migrant from Syria, or Somalia, brings to the table ? Yes we need immigration, but we can get what we need the legitimate way.	0

I've been saying for many many years that the two party system has failed and is bringing the country down with it. Looking at the presidential election provides all the evidence I need to make my case. While the endless Clinton email fiasco goes into yet another round, Trump faces two court dates within a month after the election: one for fraud and the other for raping a child. In other words, regardless of who wins next week, the person taking office as president come January will be under active criminal investigation. That's a first. Yet partisans on both sides are proclaiming the innocence of their own candidate before the evidence is in and declaring the other guilty for certain, again before the evidence is in. No one is discussing how we reached this point in the first place. Do you honestly want to make America great again? Step one is tearing your party registration to shreds. As long as you remain a partisan, you are part of the problem.	1

"The inauguration of President Trump was a remarkable moment in American history. For the first time in 8 years, we have a President who is unashamedly American. For the first time in generations, we have a President who will eschew military intervention on the world stage that does not directly contribute to and benefit American interests. We have a President who will defend religious liberty from assault by the Left, and who will support the rights of the unborn. There are ignorant folks accusing him of being a fascist - a President who explicitly intends to return power to the people, who rejects ""empire building"" and military intervention, who seeks a smaller government, one more responsive to the people, who wants to reduce and eliminate the power of government in individual lives by reducing and eliminating regulations, who explicitly rejects prejudice...

"Let's just be clear on the hiring practices of tech companies in Canada. There is more potential, more demand and more need for talent than could ever be realistically produced by Canadian universities and colleges. Careers are out most certainly out there for anyone with enough drive and smarts to meet the qualifications. How many kids were dissuaded from pursuing technology because ""that what nerds do""? How many didn't pursue it because it involves heavy doses of math and physics. That stuff is really hard. The truth is, the big companies - Google and friends - have actually opened offices in Canadian university towns just to snap up the graduating talent. There just isn't enough in certain fields. And there's a difference between the skills required for start-ups vs. established companies. Start-ups can't afford to train and nurture. They need people with experience to get them moving on the right track. Hence the worldwide search for senior level talent."	0
He is just another strong man who is setting himself up to be President forever. He is the Assad of Turkey. Except that Assad was actually much more secular as he ruled over a country formed from all of the religions in the Middle East . It's too bad that the Obama/ Clinton warmongers decided to destabilize Syria by forming ISIS . Such a tactic was bound to fail, as Russia had much more to lose in this proxy war and brought in its own military. This Syrian war followed the disastrous invasion of Libya , a stable but brutal dictatorship whose destruction opened the doors to all of those illiberal North Africans who flooded Europe and continues to do so a we speak. So this Obama / Clinton's tag team military romp thru the ME has had destructive destabilizing consequences for this region , none of which have been positive. And. It would have gotten a lot worse had Hillary been elected. Her stupid no fly zone was like a red flag to massive Russian intervention	1

"Agent Orange was a 50-50 mix of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). There's not really any fundamental difference between the two compounds other than one extra Chlorine (Cl) atom for the trichloro. During the Carter administration ""T"" was banned, but ""D"" continues to be sprayed widely (the less used component was the one that was banned). During the Bush the First administration, the US Canada International Joint Commission on the Great Lakes concluded that chemicals should be treated as classes, not individually tested, due to their toxic similarities. Industrial use of chlorine should be phased out - bleached paper, herbicides / pesticides / biocides, PVC, etc. (Cl for drinking water is only one percent of its use.)

I agree 100% Geezerly, and I'll add that this pathetic individual is none other than Roy Anthony, everyone's favorite DOC vegan pinup boy.

A bank which is in the business of selling mortgages and HELOCs tells us we're in good shape... we should listen, right? I saw yesterday a place which was available to either rent ($2400/mo) or buy $2.1 million. If this would have been a business, the P/E ratio would have been : 2,100,000/12/2,400 = 72.9 Currently, the P/E ratio for the S&P500 is about 20.5. So, it stands to reason that one can make about 3.5 times more money investing in the S&P than in the housing market in Canada. In other words, the house in my example would sell for roughly $590,000 if we'd believe the Toronto RE market should be treated using the same rigor as that used to assess the top 500 largest companies in the US.

NEKO - thank you for the history and documentation. You have put the *lie* to the Lori, DiNardo arguments that have skewed the Catholic historical positions in the name of power and their right wing base. One other note - this has nothing to do with the current, past, or future PPACA - this was an HHS ruling. Lori, DiNardo, Dolan, and company all but sank the PPACA and its value per CST because of an HHS mandate ruling. They threw the baby out with the bath water in the name of their religious liberty ideology. As Francis says - reality is more important than ideas (or ideologies). Realities as espoused by those who actually serve the poor, families, middle America and deal with unwanted pregnancies, abortions, lack of family wages, lack of affordable housing, lack of jobs, escape via drugs; family breakdowns, etc. This is where abortion is reduced (as studies prove) - not the failed Forenight for Freedom travesty.	0

The ignorant and callous comments about this heath epidemic astounds me to no end. Rather than coldly tell people to go die, think about this. Big Banks profit from laundering drug money, every one knows it, and the rich get richer. Furthermore, government profits from seizure of assets and drug money collected from this illegal activity. Lawyers, judges, rehabs rake in huge profits from this illegal activity. More money is spent incarcerating addicts selling dope to feed their drug habits than offering medical, health and recovery services, which have very long waiting lists to get in if you don't have thousands of dollars to pay for a private rehab. The government of Canada has no clue as to actual statistics and data concerning the issues of illegal drug sales. There is no war on drugs, just a class war on very sick, poor people. Babies are being born addicted to heroin and other drugs. The young people of North America are dying.	1

Why worry? Donald Trump's campaign was confused, chaotic, vague and full of nonsense. His transition period was even more confusing and filled with moments of what the. A zoo of monkeys could have done better. His press conference on January 11 was a shambles. He had six stacks of manila folders which contained documents making it official that he had turned control of his company over to his sons. Yet none of the folders were labelled which is very strange. In an office, folders are always labelled to show what they are for. The folders seemed to contain blank paper. His staffers refused to let reporters to look at the contracts. So far none of the contracts have been released to the public. I fully expect his administration to be a mess and to be a comedy of errors. I look forward to watching this clown make a fool out of himself.	1
Well that didn't happen, now did it. He's just invited all the establishment Republicans, the Wall Street oligarchs and the corporate lobbyists to take up the reins of government. The Trump U con job unraveled, and his bigly and brighter con job is also unraveling day by day. When asked on 60 Minutes why he's now installing all the same people he said he promised to kick out, ...he claimed that's all there was to choose from.  By the way, where are all the Trump supporters defending Trump's claim that he never settles, he always fights and wins? Is no one going to tell us how Trump U is actually not a scam?

"Presidents don't ""enact"" legislation. Nor does a ""precedent"". And you mistake stealing a Supreme Court seat for ""achieving"" one. You're wrong about Ford, Chrysler and Carrier. The first two you can credit to Obama. Carrier still sent jobs to Mexico. You can look stuff up, you know. I highly recommend it for the fact-challenged. Any ""savings"" he might have achieved have been eaten up by his record number of golf trips to Mar-a-Lago. Have a n ice liestyle."	0
Of all the dumb things from the past election, the hand-wringing over coal workers was one of the dumbest, and that's saying a lot. The industry is dying and what jobs there are are being automated/will be automated. I don't understand why such a tiny, tiny segment of society is getting all this attention. Find a way to soften the landing of the workers and move on. Why try to prop up a dinosaur industry? So, so dumb.	1

"Nope, I did not ""make this up"". I actually was asked to comment on the General McKiernan War Plan To Win Afghanistan while at Afghanistan in Command of A Joint Special Warfare Task Force Afghanistan ""Independent"" as I had been involved with Afghanistan since CIA Operation Cyclone, 2001 First Attempt CIA Operation Neptune Spear and the 2001 to 2002 Overthrow of the Afghan Taliban Government. After General McKiernan was Relieved of Command by President Obama, I was asked to comment on the Obama War Plan To Win Afghanistan, identical to the McKiernan War Plan To Win Afghanistan, I had disagreed with both Generals, based on what the U..S.S.R. attempted to do during CIA Operation Cyclone, the minimum number of U.S. Military Combatants (Conventional Warfare Ground Forces) needed would be above a Million, and twice that number of U.S. Military For Logistical Support."	0
There is no doubt that getting Alberta's oil to tidewater is in the national interest, so an approval is certainly expected. It just depends how many hundreds of conditions T2 puts on it as to whether the pipeline will ever go ahead.

"In truth, Clinton would do little harm to Alaska, Obama has ""locked up"" next to nothing and we are probably one of the best states able to handle refugees.

Although town hall meetings can get boisterous, if managed well they represent a singular opportunity to hear thoughts and concerns from constituents. Town halls in combination with news letters, phone calls and email messages create a comprehensive system for making our concerns known by the Representative. That said, the best way for serious political discussion is through honest and direct face to face meetings. I have found staff to be open and interested in this regard but it is a rare opportunity to see and speak with the Representative himself. Keep trying, both in Issaquah and if you are in DC. Also, remember that your vote really will matter in 2018.	0

Art, get your facts straight. When Knowles got elected, the GOP controlled legislature changed the rules for redistricting. Up to that time, the governor got to appoint ALL the members of the commission. Under the new GOP plan, the governor got to appoint two members, the GOP controlled legislature two, and the Supreme Court one. This led to a 10-10 D/R state Senate. The GOP still had control of the House, but by a smaller margin than they have today. To say that they tried to redistrict the Republican Party out of existence, is baloney. When Parnell was governor, the GOP got to appoint four of the five members. Parnell gerrymandered the legislature, in an attempt to get rid of as many Democrats as possible, and any Republicans who opposed his SB21 oil tax giveaway.	0
"Sayem, we're reading about his despicable antics in the Globe and Mail today - I'd say that's pretty good self-promotion. The fact that he ""says some stupid things"" doesn't take away from that.

As long as we continue to target immigration by wealth, and to allow the overseas wealthy to purchase homes regardless of whether or not they even live here, then working families, including our non wealthy immigrants, will find it harder and harder to compete for housing."	0

What I lament about Leaf haters on this thread is their complete inability to make reasoned judgement calls or analysis. In the last 50 years, 17 different clubs have won the Stanley Cup. Through some or all of that period, 13 different clubs have demonstrated complete incompetence, the Leafs being an obvious leader in that category but not the sole recipient of such a moniker. More importantly, the ups and downs are evident by all clubs over the years. Being able to understand the nuances of emerging improvement or not is key. That ability is lost on the haters. I lived in Boston 2001, 3 years before their WS win, lived in Chicago several years before their 92 final and at a different time a few years ago before the Cubs win this past year. Knowing how to recognize the early trends of a potential winner takes reasoned judgement, something lacking by posters who lambast passionate Leaf followers. The fools are evident by their blind hatred. Time will decide their validity.	1

"The dead and dying Irish Refugees on the 1847 ""Coffin Ships"" overwhelmed the limited health care facilities on Grosse Île and Partridge Island. http://lekiosquemedias.com/2013/01/17/petite-histoire-des-irlandais/ ""In June, the superior of the Gray Nuns summoned her nuns, explained the situation to them and asked for volunteers, stating that she will send them to death. All accepted. At the end of the month, 30 of the 40 nuns are sick, 7 die soon after. They are replaced by the Sisters of Providence. It's not enough; the cloistered sisters of the Hôtel-Dieu receive exceptional permission to go out to help the sick. Priests are volunteers; Anglophones lean very closely at the dying to hear their confessions. They succumb in their turn; Jesuits are brought from New York. There are 600 orphans on Grosse Île. At the Sunday Mass, at the Cathedral of Quebec, parishioners see poorly dressed children... In less than two weeks, all the orphans found a home. ... 3000 dead "" You did ask."	0
Thoughtful comment, Jason. Short answer: That's why there's a graduated income tax. Let's apply your logic elsewhere. To fund our enormous military, it involves taking from others. To maintain our extensive highway system involves taking from others. To keep our courts and prisons operating involves taking from others. And so on. The people who are benefitting the most from the system we've established - infrastructure, rule of law, security...should be the people who help the most keeping the system functioning.	0

"Specific errors in this report include all the GET revenue numbers shown on slide 25. The slide is titled, ""GET Collections by County June 2017"". To begin with, June 2017 GET revenue numbers have not yet been calculated or released by the State. But if previous month's or year's numbers are used, it is clear that none of the reported revenues on this slide are correct. More importantly, the slide seems intended to show where GET revenues are generated, but Hawaii GET revenues are not broken down by where the tax was generated, only by where the tax is reported. Oahu based companies, doing business on neighbor islands, report all their revenues on Oahu. And do not break down which island these revenues were generated."	0

Harper spent tens of millions FIGHTING Khadr to the Supreme Court TWICE losing badly both times.

Several years ago I used to pick up my grandkids in Palmer and brought them out to our home in South Anc. That year we had a lot of snow and the Glenn was a skating rink. I had a Tundra with full studs and didn't spin a wheel. I counted 20+ or more cars in the median, some upright and several on their tops. What really got me the most was the cars that were either white or light colored 10-1. (Maybe a behaviorally trained Doctor) could write a book for the study of morons on the roads in the winter.  I often wondered if they were brain dead or just too busy yakking on their cell phones instead of driving for the conditions.

Capitalism succeeds despite itself. Given its own devices, it would be an inescapable authoritarianism - and in some places it is. While it is better than feudalism, it is not as good as a more democratic cooperative socialism. It is an interim step saved only by the free market (which is not the same thing) so that some workers can move up by quitting and because a consumer surplus placates workers who would otherwise be slaves. Tobin is a blessing for Newark and an implied curse on those bishops who would embrace Trumpism (who will never get their red hats). The problem with the pro-life movement is not the need for justice for the unborn or the sincerity of the followers, but of the cravenness of the leaders who have launched onto a solution that will never work, keeping them in jobs. Nebraska has many faith filled people. Their hearts are in the right place - if only they could see some percentage in an economics that were a bit more socialistic.	0
I regularly use my bike for transportation, and I see nothing wrong with figuring out a way to tax cyclists. The roads get a lot of tax money from gas, and while bikes don't destroy the roads like cars, trucks, etc., we need to pay our share (especially if we start getting more dedicated bike lanes). That being said, I think throwing out an arbitrary number like this doesn't help.	0

Today's GOP is little more than a white identity death cult. They are motivated by fear, hate, and resentment. During the Obama administration they made it very clear that they don't want a multicultural multi-ethnic America and equal rights for all. They miss the good old days when lynching black folks was family entertainment for white people. They miss the days when white men could get away with murdering black people while they prayed in church. They welcome endorsements from Klansmen and neo-nazis. Not all Republicans are racists and bigots. How ever they are all willing to share the GOP with them. They have no desire for a merit based society. Mere equality is a demotion for them.	1

To quote, ""This does not mean that if a President were to abuse this power vested in him or her...a court would be powerless"", and ""in consideration for a bribe could no doubt be set aside by a court"", in my mind leaves the decision a lot more open than your confident prediction. The reasons given by the President were vague, contradictory, and irrational. Gigaba has no finance qualifications, Gordhan was against the Nuclear deal, the economy was clearly considered healthier (locally and internationally) under Gordhan than Van Rooyen and Gigaba ( albeit a lesser reaction to Gigabas appointment ) Zuma has abused his position to clear the way for the nuclear deal, where bribes are undoubtedly a concern, and between security reports, youth promotion or break down in communications, we will have to wait and see what comes out.

While there are unethical journalists (and unethical presidential candidates), I think the vast majority of people working in journalism (and in politics) are well-meaning and generally honest and forthright folks. So I suggest we stick to specific examples about specific people and see where that takes us. ..."	0

I'm surprised commentators didn't pick up on the implications of his speech. He was putting Washington on notice that he fully intends to carry out his campaign promises - all of them. He was speaking both to his supporters who put their faith in him, and Washington insiders, most of whom didn't. He is unwilling to let anyone off the hook with some kind of Can't We All Be Friends approach. He boldly set the dividing line, either you're with us, or against us. And he expects everyone to get to work now.	0

Allowing a business to use Religion as an excuse not to serve someone is the ultimate slippery slope to allowing a business owner to discriminate against anyone, for nearly any reason. How is refusing to serve a gay couple now any different than the racists that refused to serve blacks or mixed raced marriages back in the 40's and 50's? The answer - its not. Its discrimination painted with a different brush and people are using the Bible as their shield. And to be clear - no one in this case was forcing this baker to do anything different than what he already did for hundreds/thousands of customers before. No one asked him to cater the wedding or write something on the cake that he found offensive. It was simply the fact that a cake he was making was going to be used in a gay wedding. Thats it. So, based on that standard, could the owner of Hobby Lobby come out and say they no longer will sell any of their products to anyone who has had an abortion? How is that any different?	1
So you ban guns and gun death doesn't go down, but you can people from 6 nations and we are protected from terrorists. See the hole in your logic?

The quoted banker points to an interplay between supply and demand. Well, there is nothing wrong with placing more emphasis, focus and policy change on the CAUSATIVE side of the equation. Because if Toronto is becoming like Vancouver... ... then the CAUSE of the problem is external money (not earned by locally employed workers). That EXTERNAL MONEY is the ONLY way to get house prices to dozens of times the average annual local income. It is the ONLY way. A limited supply alone in a Canadian city CANNOT get house prices to dozens of times the average annual local income. It is an economic and mathematical impossibility. Banks do not give to young workers a bunch of mortgages for dozens of times their annual local incomes. That is why you MUST first and foremost address the causative side of the equation, which is the DEMAND side. And the massive, buckets-of-dollars-from-the-sky demand is coming from the noted EXTERNAL source, if Toronto is emulating Vancouver.	0
Sarge, you are totally unhinged. Have you been drinking prior to posting, or are all your stream-of-consciousness posts so incoherent.

America was already bad about just ignoring rulings against its violations of trade treaties (see softwood lumber). If we accept an even more toothless tribunal process, how is the rest of the deal going to be worth anything more than the paper it's written on? They'll probably just break it the second it's convenient, and say ""yeah, and what are you going to do about it?""."	0

"I was wondering the same thing about the ""unfunded liability"" (which is not really what it sounds like). The figure varies over the years. At times the system has been ""overfunded"" and at other times ""underfunded."" I don't believe that PERS does interim reports on the system and its assets, but it would be interesting to know just what that ""unfunded"" figure was now, after the recent stock market surge. Overall, though, PERS invested assets should be looked at like any long term retirement investments. It's mostly stay steady, make your payments, and ride out the inevitable ups and downs to get the long term greatest return. Playing political games with the system, the way the legislature did recently, is how we got into the difficulties we are in now."	0

I understand you need to keep moving the goalposts, but again, you are 100% incorrect. The facts are not on your side, again. We are 100% NOT on a pro-violence path, and lets be clear, we never were. Your term is just a talking point and nonsensical at that. Violent people, gang members, hit-men, murders are on pro-violence paths. The average American is not, so stick to stats and facts. Violent crime is down 51% in the last twenty years while gun ownership is up 141%. FBI Numbers. As I said previously, this is why debating people who cannot see a millimeter beyond their personal perspective is pointless. You think everything you say is spot on, while ignoring facts and reality. When you're posting your unrealistic ideology, you only preach to those who share your same worldview. The average person, and non-partisan can see right past everything you're saying. With that, I'm done wasting my time with real numbers and facts. KThxBi	0

Totally agree that the Ontario Liberal's plan is a mess, but the NDP's plan is even more ridiculous, and the PC's still have no plan at all. People keep wondering why Ontarian's keep voting in the Liberals, well, the answer is, because the PC's and NDP's keep handing it to them on a silver platter. The core of the NDP plan, get this, is to put an extra surcharge on urban dwellers electric bills (the people who vote NDP) and then subsidize rural electric bills (the people who don't vote NDP). So, in essence, their plan is not to get elected. Brown, on the other hand, is completely MIA on this issue. The last time he spoke on hydro, on the radio, he made a complete fool of himself. So, if Ontarian's really want the Liberals out, they should start by whipping the opposition parties into shape and creating platforms Ontarian's can vote for.	1
"Thanks for your POV. I don't know if having a stay-at-home parent solves all ills -- I think in previous decades a lot of problems were simply buried and never got read or heard about -- but I appreciate your explanation. ""In the 1950's and the 1960's we did not have any issues with classes being 35 kids each. They were all respectful and got a good education because if they weren't well behaved and did not do their school work there was holy heck to pay when they faced mom and dad."" Spot on.

How about extra lanes between Anchorage and Wasilla, something that the public can actually use, where there is growth.

"""In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, the news is flooded with reports of abuse, assault, and harassment, largely of minorities, by jubilant Trump supporters celebrating the ascent of their candidate, a candidate who campaigned by appealing to white heterosexual Christian supremacy. Over the past 48 hours, women have been assaulted for wearing the hijab, property has been defaced with swastikas, LGBT Americans have been threatened, and African Americans have experienced election result-specific harassment by fellow Americans touting the election of Donald Trump as the dawn of a new America, apparently one where they consider that the ugliest of racial and social animus to have the seal of presidential approval.""

"I would also like to add that the people of Calgary should be proud of electing a visible minority Muslim as mayor whether or not they voted for him.

As an Edmontonian and an Albertan, I have been teased by Torontonians (and other Canadians) for living in ""red neck"" country (is that also coded language?). Imagine my delight to see Calgary hold up the torch for Canadian inclusiveness in a world where we were disgraced by the antics of a mayor elected by Torontonians.

The main issue is a legal and contractual one. Bell Globe Media bid for and purchased the rights to nfl broadcasts and the Super Bowl a few years ago and they hold those rights until 2018-19. The money they spent was budgeted for under the existing CRTC rules that allow commercial substitution. Now part way through the contract, the CRTC has changed the rules - just for the Superbowl broadcast only, not any other simulcast or other US tv programs (that are shown on Canadian networks). It would have been fine if the CRTC announced that after the existing NFL tv contract is over, they will change the policy, but they did not do that.	0

i see this situation as a failure in governance over too large an area. The practical solution is the division of this state into three states. Use the Permanent Fund to carry out this necessary task. Anchorage (Southwest Alaska), Fairbanks(North Alaska), and Juneau(Southeast Alaska) will each be in a State all their own. The future of this one state as it is has frankly become a dullsville scene of failing management struggles brought about by three different tails trying to wag the same dog.	0
There were several eye witnesses who spoke to the news media but the person that was incorrectly identified and quoted by the ADN article was on the phone with Sheppard Smith on Fox News. This man was standing next to the first victim shot. You can check their news site and listen to the exchange. There was a person who was interviewed by another cable network who was NOT at the baggage claim area but at the one next to it who told what he was seeing to another network. There also was the woman who was texting one of the other networks from her airplane on the tarmac. The gunman was NOT shot by police as reported in the earlier ADN account. He put his gun down after he was done, sat down on the floor waiting to be arrested. The difference in what Les Holt reported and the what Fox eye witness reported was that it one was first hand from the scene and being heard by viewers after the gunman surrendered and after the injured were removed. He was still there when the second alarm came	0

There are households in which the unmarried female draws SSI (& rent subsidy) for being an unwed mother, continues to bear more children at taxpayer expense, while choosing to remain unmarried to the father of those children because marriage would disqualify her for benefits .

Those are the 'cheats' conservatives cite when screaming about reforming or ending social safety nets. How is it different for Mr. Callahan to choose not to hold a job but spend his money to promote his own vanity, and then expect the public to feed his family?

The ""stated"" rationale? Britain, Germany, France, Italy, etc. are conduit countries for terrorists to come into the US. They all have experiences with radicalized immigrants. Never know who from their countries might have clicked on an ISIS propoganda site in the past. And, then, there's the Las Vegas shooter. Where are his ancestors from? Wasn't his evil the result of the stuff that cooked genetically inside of him? Very simple. Thankfully, our Constitution disallows that sort of pretense of thought. Although I disagree with the ""result"" of Chin's efforts, I am CERTAIN the effort themselves are righteous and desirable for America. AND, it just so happens that Federal Judges, much, much, much smarter and accomplished than anyone here, happen to, so far, and officially, agree with Chin."	0
The answer isn't to end immigration. We need it to keep the country growing since our demographics are older rather than younger. All western world countries are this way. Now if you could get immigrants to settle anywhere except Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver...then maybe you have a solution...but last I checked this is still a free country.	0

This is a silly car IMHO. An overburdened luxury sedan with a beefed up motor and tweaked suspension will give its wealthy owner bragging rights but that won't make it a sports car. Autotragic transmission, launch control, and creature comforts exceeding the average suburban home are a far cry from BMW's roots with the venerable 2002. This is the automotive equivalent of a trophy wife. Sexy at first glance, but a high maintenance item who is quite obviously a bauble that functions mainly to inflate her partner's ego.	1

Religious/ political chaos in the times are of a piece, fueling the fires of internecine violence. If religions are authentic, they would temper divisions of cultic faith with a mind politically focused on common wellbeing. Because churches lack a united will and political vision, they foment frictions that are insensitive to the 'big picture' that frustrates the global hope of culturally coming together in a vision of mercy toward one another and All Other. Wars of religious conflict are the worst kind, for they do not inspire, but fire any sense of mercy, and the future of humankind goes up in smoke together with the future of life on earth.	0

Jacob Zuma intended long ago, and now has no option but, to release Cyril Ramaphosa and replace him with NDZ.

"So let's look at the logic of this. A 15 year old is indoctrinated by his family/the community that is close to him. As a result, in a crisis situation, he tosses a grenade and kills a US Medic. He gets captured by the US, they put him in prison and now Canada brings him home, lets him free, and plans on apologizing to him and compensating him (with hard-earned tax dollars) to the tune of $10 M. This makes absolutely no sense. Let's say a 15 yo living in a bad neighborhood is ""indoctrinated"" by his older brother and local gang to join and take on their lifestyle. The teenager (and other gang members) are robbing a convenience store and the police arrive while the robbery is still in progress. Our 15 yo shoots and kills a police officer in the ensuing melee. Does our government issue an apology and compensate him? I guess they should if we are applying the same logic. Easy to be liberal on this but imagine if it was your child, father, mother or spouse killed by Kadr. Not easy!!"	0

Making pension debt super-priority in bankruptcy and restructuring would go a long way to solve this problem and provide pension security. Under the Wage Earner Protection Program introduced by the Conservative government in 2008/9 normal pension contributions for the year of bankruptcy were granted super-priority status. A good start, but not far enough. Super-priority status should be extended to the entire pension so the pension gets addressed as a high priority whether the company declares bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act or restructures under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. Super-priority is one of the few financial terms common in both. Not even secured and unsecured creditors are common.	0

Amazon will need at least a complex of 6 - 10 buildings between 15 and 25 stories tall. Most of the urban business centers in the Denver region lack the available land for this extent of development, but there are a couple that could meet the challenge. The Westminster Center off of 104th and US-36 is a slim possibility but being so close to the municipal airport in Broomfield makes that locale unlikely. Likewise the Lakewood Tech Center on Union between US-6 and Alameda Av could be in the running; but is there enough real estate, even with that 59 acres currently on the auction block adjacent to the Denver Federal Center on the SE corner of US-6 and Union Av ? The coming Denver Tech Center North on I-25 adjacent to the E-470 tollway (Northpark) would appear to be the best choice as there is plenty of real estate, freeways with room to grow, easy access to DIA, and no challenging height restrictions as there is no airport too close (unless you include Erie Municipal).	0

Actually, I'd keep the JeffersonDavies statues too, even if they were erected in the 1950'sand 1960's.

""" ...the burden of proof is on Trump."" What planet are you from? It certainly isn't Planet Earth, because there isn't a government anywhere that proves its claims beyond publicly available statistics. Claim: The Russians hacked the US election. Where is the proof of that? If it exists, it's never been revealed. All that exists are public statements by a small number of government officials. We don't have a shred of evidence to verify or falsify what they said. A large portion of the information received from a government is of that sort. Typically, people believe a government they favour and distrust one they don't. That's naive. ALL governments seek to influence the public's opinion in their favour. They do so by, at a minimum, saying only the things that they want you to hear. All of the other information- the stuff that would permit you to come to a sound and balanced conclusion- is suppressed."	0

Actual daily bike commuters don't do the things you describe. Those that ride on sidewalks or the wrong way in traffic probably haven't ridden a bike since they were kids and think it is safer, which is the exact opposite of the truth. The newbies will stop riding in this unsafe manor if they have the choice of protected lanes. The bigger issue is that no one really knows bike safety or rules of the road because they are not taught. I this information should be included in standard drivers education and be part of the written assessment. This will make motorists and cyclist alike, aware of bicycle safety and bicycle operation. Then it won't matter if there are protected or not protected bike lanes, or even no lanes at all.	0

If some pious idiot told you that going to commuion with a ""mortal sin"" on your soul (as if this was something you could casually do), justice is the Church coming to the conclusionn that Paul was talking about receiving without believing, because there was no confession for all but the worst sins and no concept of mortal sin.

If certain hierarchs persecuted theologians because of brand loyalty and then are ignored by the Pope when they are disrespectful, this is justice at its sweetest.

There is no evidence anywhere that she tried to use this to any unfair advantage...none. Zero. There is just the howling of dogs kept in the fetid pens of the GOP and the howling dogs in the slums of American morality awakenened by the racist dog whistles that drive so much of their agenda. I am not even quite sure why this moronic Ayyadurai, a Hindu and not an American Indian, at least so it seems, has opened his filthy mouth and some in the press think his mutterings should be reported. He should be laughed off the stage as quickly as possible. Thousands of people have American Indian ancestors. It is OK.	1

The Swastika symbol has also come to have its own more generic meaning too. as being a symbol representing intolerance and hate. So one might spray paint it anywhere one thought that hatred and intolerance existed. Many on the left have used it in protests against Donald Trump, as well as many other conservatives, for example. So you are right that it is not necessarily a Nazi. The Nazi movement is all but dead in our country. The handful that still pursue it are generally imbeciles: people with an extremely low IQ. Many are drug addicts too. Do you not remember that Nazi couple that had all of their children taken away from them by the state of New York 4 years ago? The state proved that they were morons, and unfit parents who beat their children. These are the kinds of stupid idiots that follow the Nazi ideology today.

Complete baloney, from top to bottom. You are making yourself look a fool, denigrating my service in the US Army. The lives lost in Iraq owing to our pointless war were wasted, and that includes the approximately half million civilian deaths of women, children and noncombatants. ISIS exists as a byproduct of that war. All our fighting has inspired another generation of tens of thousands of terrorists who would willingly die to blow up a dozen US citizens. It's a damn shame that so many economically poor people have to risk their lives at low pay for the opportunity to get an education and a grubstake in life, but that's America.	1
Nope. ten years. More than that it was the experience of having a knife pulled on me, seeing friends and the overall social capitol of me and mine deteriorate quickly, and having life for the next 3 years become significantly more difficult - all as an immediate and direct consequence of a single politicians actions, his willingness to listen to the PBA, and the sheer ignorance and lack of understanding he consistently demonstrates in handling the situation. EXPERIENCE turned me onto politics. This is very different than reading a book and trying to formulate my views based on what I was told. Had I done so I'd likely end up as ignorant as the politician in question - a man who has never seen the issues he affects from the ground level. Then I show up to some poly sci class at PSU where we pretend to be senators and kids seem to care more about agreeing with one another than having a reason for doing so (this is their perception of partisanship).	1

Suggesting that Krista Kafer's questioning of the necessity of school boards is Utopian is way too funny. You do have to like the twisted trail the letter writer took to make such an absurd leap. To begin with, there is no Republican/corporate dogma. For one thing, rich business owners support Democrats. But the letter writer is correct in saying the individual is important . But so is government, in a limited role. Public schools are government entities, but parents should have the biggest influence on the student.The LOL line was the GOP dislike of education. We like informed electorate because they tend to vote Republican. Now, about unions, they have too much influence on the election of school boards. Finally, there is the third paragraph. An incredible bunch of baseless assertions that ends in the all-to-funny bit about educational utopia. It's like the writer was holding on to that gem, looking for the right time to wedge it in to a conversation.What a laugh.	0

This is a problem in Ireland as well. Fifteen years ago I had the veins in my right leg stripped but the vascular surgeon wouldn't do the right leg. He said it wasn't varicose veins but he either didn't hear my question as to what it was or choose to ignore me. So, three years ago I was diagnosed with lymphedema in both legs but primarily in the left leg. Long story short, no operations recommended, no coverage for MLD (must be an oncology patient), and coverage for compression garments is nearly nonexistent! If memory serves, it's one pair of compression stockings every two years.	0
Tell that to your whining master. Yellow is his color. Now I, as a private citizen, am free to repeatedly express what a cowardly, obseqious and hypocritical thing that was for Nana to do. Now they’ll have to go after everyone who thinks Trump is exactly what he is, and expresses on their own time,and fire them. Which they Already haven’t done. Uh oh, I smell a well- deserved lawsuit.

Yup, he chose. The FBI agents chose. Many people made choices. Each and every choice that was contributory to the ensuing death must be taken into account in a rational evaluation of the situation. If we invoke critical thinking and if we believe human life is important (which you perhaps would disagree with), every choice made and the alternatives ignored must be examined to ensure that needless loss of life does not occur. When you say he chose.... I interpret you to mean that you don't give a rat's ass about his life and wouldn't lift a finger to change similar situations that might arise in the future. As long as the dude chooses wrong, who cares if we kill him.	1

"Quo Primum was intended to set the liturgical reforms of Trent in stone. As the Mass and the Office have been reformed several times since then I was pointing out how ridiculous was Francis's use of the word ""irreversible"".

"More blather and alternative ""facts"" In 2014 Suncor alone paid $1.9 billion in income tax, (check out their annual report) and that doesn't include royalties, municipal, EI, CPP or any other forms of taxation, and Suncor is just one of hundreds of other energy companies like Canadian Natural Resources, Athabaska Oil, Nexxen and those other smaller ones like....Exxon, Shell, Chevron. So much for alternative ""facts"" from canada1. Land used is subject to municipal tax among other fees and is a source of millions of dollars that go towards municipal services and education in every jurisdiction where energy companies operate.

Like most monopolies, benefiting from inertia and aggressive mediocrity. I know of a parish (in the Fremont, CA area) which renewed its liturgical practice, to the point where Sunday Mass was making intentional disciples out of lukewarm Catholics. At the request of a couple of dozen disgruntled families, the religious order running the place replaced the priest after 11 years of a 12 year term with an ideologue backed by that faction who threw out all of the renewal in a month's time, proving once again that it's far easier to destroy than to build. The first thing done: shutting down the 1 Mass (out of 9 on Sunday) where things were being done by the book--the one producing most of those intentional disciples. The second thing: hardbound missals from Corpus Christi Watershed were put in the closet (or thrown out) and replaced by Breaking Bread.	0

"At first I thought Trump was just a liar. We can understand lying leaders because we have precedent. But liars at least have some grasp of the truth, enough that they can decide to say something they know is false in the hopes of gaining political advantage by deceiving the public. Then I thought that he might be a BS artist, someone who's careless whether a thing is true or false but crashes on anyway, laying waste to truth, pandering to ignorance and prejudice, again for political gain. In the last week I've concluded that Trump is even more dangerous. He is delusional. He can't really be accused of lying or even BSing because he genuinely believes the ""alterative facts"" that he - and now, sadly, his henchpersons- spout. He really believes (and, worse, cares) that there were a million and a half people in DC for his inauguration, that building the Wall and refusing refugees will make America safer, that he will be able to restore US manufacturing jobs. Sad, as someone once said."	1

I am among those for whom watching the Broncos is not an option, it is an addiction. I think it's a healthy addiction though, because without a football team to pledge loyalty to, without bitter divisional rivalries as an outlet for the competitive spirit, people will seek the same thing in political figures and parties. Perhaps that is why Trump stoked the flames on these protests (which had all but died out before his comments) -- to get people to redirect the passion they formerly put into the NFL season into his agenda. Seems like it's working, unfortunately. I have generally supported Trump but am very saddened by this path.	0
"What is that thing you used to write your post? A computer? What is it made of? Steel? What is steel made with? MOLYBDENUM. There's your answer. Until we go back to the stone age, mining is a very necessary component of modern society. Mining is by definition destructive. Best we can do is require reclamation bonds to rehab the areas after the mining ends, protect the environment outside the mine site (runoff, etc). Unfortunately what often happens is mining companies conveniently declare bankruptcy after closing a mine and negate their reclamation responsibility, or the bonds are insufficient to finish the job. Then it becomes a superfund site if it's bad enough. And we all pay for that through taxes. Someone said it best above what companies and republicans are always trying to do: ""socialize costs, privatize profits""."	0

The fact that sleaze was revealed (transparency achieved) is irrelevant because the person (Putin) who revealed the factual existence of the sleaze had bad motives? And could have revealed that other people were also sleazy? That's sort of like saying you should ignore the testimony of a witness to a crime because they only told the police about the crime because they didn't like the defendant. Truth is irrelevant if the person who exposes the truth is a bad person or a bad motive. So if a 'whistleblower' reveals that a government agency is doing something wrong, the fact that the agency is doing it was only revealed because the whistleblower had an affair with the person in charge which ended badly. Or hundreds of other reasons someone has for disliking someone is why they revealed true information.	0
You're largely right but the current federal government is in the process of cleaning up the Criminal Code which will certainly get rid of some Harper nonsense and the courts are striking down other unconstitutional bits of Harperia but you are right that the provinces are the main culprits in failing to invest in sufficient resources to run the justice system, including detention centres.

"Nope. There is absolutely no grounds for calling communism a crime against humanity. It meets none of the criteria, it fits none of the legal requirements. There are two types of ""crimes against humanity"" - specific actions, and ideologies with specific attributes. Communism, being an ideology, could only be the latter kind - and it doesn't have the required attributes. It doesn't dehumanize anybody, it doesn't consider anybody subhuman, it doesn't deny anybody any rights that others enjoy under the same ideology. You may consider it a bad ideology, but it didn't meet the criteria for crime against humanity. Apartheid, like Nazism, does. Some communist leaders committed actions that were crimes against humanity, but those actions were not done because the ideology demanded (indeed the ideology expressly forbade it- which is why they kept them secret. Nobody knew of Stalin's Gulags until after Stalin was dead and it suited Kruschev to destroy the great WW2 hero's reputation)."	0

""" the natural-resource wealth upon which this country and its social-welfare systems have been built."" Has been built. The past. It has done a marvellous job, but as demonstrated in ""The Spirit Level"" wealth is not a good measure of the qualities of life in a country. All the developed countries have the same characteristic, namely that an increase in wealth will not improve living conditions. A good example is the US. Very wealthy and one of the two worst countries in which to live. By comparison, Japan with mediocre wealth, an economy in tatters and along with Sweden, the best place to live. Something more that countries have in common. Their living conditions correlate with income inequality. (Income of the bottom 20% of population divided by the income of the top 20%.) The lower the inequality the better the living conditions. The US and Portugal with high inequality of income as expected have the poorest living conditions. So Canada would best live with what we have."	0

In 1981 my friend Marty purchased a 3 bedroom home earning $3.35 an hour, the federal minimum wage. In 1986 I purchased a 2 bedroom on $4 an hour wages. Had I been afforded the 2.75%-3.5% rates on 15 year loans today I could have purchased 2 starter homes on $4 an hour wages for less than the mortgage I took out at 9%. Under current market conditions I get 2 homes. Post Katrina New Orleans abandoned Section 8 subsidized housing as this only subsidizes poverty. They are building entry level starter homes that can be purchased on the federal minimum wage, as we speak, and especially with historic low interest rates. The reason you cannot buy this affordable housing in Oregon today is because high density planning outlawed affordable housing to increase property tax revenue through market manipulation at the development stage.

Regardless of Trump's belligerance and bullyism, cooler US heads need to take control.

They dont trust the US (and Trump only reinforces that-who would want to negotiate with someone who is likely lying) By all means mean a defensive shield that works but focus on talks. The real threat is that N K decides that terrorists might provide hard currency for some nuclear stuff. Then we are really in trouble. Negotiations need to focus on making N Korea feel their future is secure (ie; end the Korean war) and on getting security around their nuke supply. Evn Russia poses this same risk I mean Pakistan has nukes and they live right beside the Taliban and remnants of AlQaeda	1
There are multiple problems here. I think most of us know that the great majority of these people are economic migrants and not legitimate refugees. Unfortunately, once they set foot in Canada they get the full use of Canada's legal system to stay, and that legal system is hideously slow, creaky, inefficient, incompetent and expensive. Every claimant gets a government paid lawyer and if they fail their refugee hearing they have multiple avenues of appeal through the court system. That's why Canada Border Services determined that every failed refugee claimant costs us $50,000. And that assumes they fail. Given the Liberals have mostly appointed refugee advocates to the refugee boards the approval numbers are set to skyrocket. During Chretien's time almost everyone was accepted, compared to the very low acceptance rates in Erope at the time.	0
I’m experiencing firsthand the sad side effects of drug addiction. An addict is probably not reading this. You may know an addict and maybe, just maybe, they’ll heed a warning. But probably not. I’ve battled with my wife for over four years. It started with prescription meds, which included Adderall, an amphetamine, morphine, an opiate, and other pain pills. Each month when the prescriptions are ready there is a race around town to see where these can be filled, as many times a pharmacy will not carry the prescribed dosage or have the needed amount of pills. This has evolved into selling some of the pills to “friends” in need and has become a small business. The system is broken. You find the right doctor and the prescriptions are written. Copay is about $5 per prescription, but on the street can be sold for hundreds and up to a couple of thousand dollars. The money then used to buy crystal meth and heroin, both offering better effects than Adderall and morphine.	0

Canada needs to go into these negotiations with its own well-constructed and documented list of concessions that it will want as a quid pro quo for changes the US will ask for. Otherwise, Canada's negotiating position will simply be 'please keep concessions ask of us to a minimum' and that is hardly a firm negotiating stance nor is it the case that Canada doesn't have some valid complaints of its own. For example, the US subsidizes its Agricultural industries big time albeit not through supply management to the extent Canada does. Canada should push back by insisting that the US either reduce its subsidies (hardly likely). or recognize to a greater extent the equivalence of US subsidies and Canadian supply management from the international trade perspective.

Only a fool or a right-winger (but I repeat myself) would believe that the rhetoric from the Whitehouse about Russians being bad actors was anything but deliberately false news to create the impression that Trump isn't in Putin's pocket. He always has been. Trump has never once criticized or even acknowledged Putin's interference in the US election, despite 17 intelligence agencies and the bi-partisan Congressional Intelligence Committee showing him the evidence. Those are serious charges, and any other president would have denounced it. Unless of course, the president won because of Russian interference. Now, they'll pretend to kiss and make up, and everyone is supposed to believe that this wasn't the plan all along.	1
"Good. This is what happens when our dumb president tries to rule the country by executive order. Fortunately, we have generally intelligent federal judges that will likely dismantle most of the Vulgar Talking Yam's ""legacy."" Rather than actually crafting and proposing legislation and working with Congress (you know, like how the Executive branch is *intended* to work), his executive orders are sort of like legal Tweets - knee-jerk reactions, simple solutions to vastly complex problems. I suppose he probably just signs whatever his handlers put in front of him now. Classic Trump, though: always taking the easy way, the shortcut, diving deep into the land of Unintended Consequences. The man's entire life is a record of almost not failing at everything he's ever attempted. Partly because he's so profoundly stupid, and partly because he's never worked a day in his life."	1

I didn't vote for President Trump yet, he is OUR President. I don't agree with a number of his policies. Like it or not, he's doing what he said he'd do.

How brave was the Acting AG? She's gone within days, anyway. What did she have to lose by doing this? Conclusion: Not much. Perhaps not anything at all. Wow. I wish all my decisions were that easy. On the other hand... Trump could have fired Yates AND the entire department. Mistake one: he didn't. Or he might shrug and wait for her replacement to take charge and clean house. Mistake two: didn't do that, either. Trump cannot ignore anybody who opposes his whims--even when he had basically NOTHING to lose by doing so. It's just...not...his...style.

Sometimes it's planned and welcomed, sometimes it's an unwelcome effect. Love-play is not ""a total self gift"" but there is a lovely experience of lovers' losing themselves in one another as it were."	0

A Metal Fabricator or Sheet Metal Worker deal with that exact problem on a routine basis. Steel is expensive and decreasing scrap factors (or increasing steel utilization) can make or break a company trying to make money doing this. When it's not just a bunch of circles it's a multitude of irregular shapes fitting onto a sheet of steel for a plasma arc, oxy-fuel, or laser cutting table. Then they have to learn how to program these problems into a nesting software and deal with all of the intricacies (such as can two parts share a common cut line, do we start the cut in the part or on the outside of the part, etc.). But as Synergic Effect correctly stated below, what the schools do is send the kids who are poor at math towards the skilled trades.	0

I miss the Department Stores of old, i.e. big stores that had all like things together e.g. you would find all men's clothing in one place and within it all pants in a limited area, shirts in another, sweater also, and so on. Today these stores, I include HBC and Nordstroms in this, are no longer department stores but indoor malls. If you are looking for a shirt or a sweater or whatever, you have to wander along and stop at a dozen different manufacturers' space. There is no way of discovering which shirt etc. in the place you like best short of running back and forth all over the place. The entire set up is no longer a department store but an indoor mall minus the concrete wall separating the different stores. As each of this manufacturers' sales points sells fairly similar merchandise a large part of their costs must be in advertising (label promotion) and in payments for the best location they can afford - resulting in overpriced rags made in Bangladesh.	0

The problem that is the price of electricity in Ontario began decades ago, when electricity was generated by a Crown Corp (Ontario Hydro) with no key performance indicators to ensure that the industry was being operated efficiently. The Premier's office could dictate the electricity rate, and did so often setting the rate well below actual costs, thereby embedding debt decade after decade. Then the completely insane and irresponsible decision to build the two Darlington nuclear reactors was made at a time when regulated utilities in the States were decommissioning their nuclear units as fast as they could because they were such money holes. Augmenting all this debt was an irresponsible capacity planning department inside Ontario Hydro where managers had no motivation to care--and told me they didn't care--if their poor planning resulted in Ontario having to make power purchases at higher prices from U.S. states. Then the opened grid saw a bill collecting the embedded debt.	0

"I know I am damn tired of being lied to by the Establishment Republicans who repealed Obamacare when they knew damn well then President Obama would veto; and, then when they are in control of the 3 branches of government they show that they have no intention of repealing Obamacare--we are mad as hell at them. George Wallace was right when he said there wasn't a ""dimes worth of difference in the 2 parties."" The American People support President Trump; and, believe me we are willing to do whatever is necessary to save the Trump Presidency; and, save the republic. As far as I am concerned the Democrat Party is committing treason with their B.S. and the Republican Progressives (Establishment) are enabling a potential coup. I blame the Progressive control of the public school system for teaching revisionist history and taking out the Civics, and Geography classes--producing ignorant graduates for 2 1/2 generations. Democrats are all Communists and enabled by the Republican Leadership."	1

Universities have been padding their graduate programs for decades to generate income. The only people who need a graduate degree in the majority of university programs are those moving into the post-secondary teaching field or into a specific research field that requires a graduate degree. I think many students take graduate degrees because they believe this will give them an edge on a job (having hired many new graduates over the years, it doesn't), or they are afraid they can't secure a decent job with only their undergraduate degree, so they take a graduate degree to stave off working at Starbucks.	0

Perhaps there is a portion that can be made into off channel habitat that has some actual natural ecological function for a variety of native species?

Willamette Riverkeeper would be another organization that could help fuel both restoration and recreational access.	0

May I respectfully suggest that you look at a map of Canada? If you were to do so you would see that our country is huge, admittedly. However, you would also note the areas that people actually want to live in are not huge and tend to be clustered near the American border. And many of them such as the Lower Mainland and the greater Toronto area, it can be argued, are overpopulated. So unless you can make a good argument as to how you are going to persuade your half million a year to take up residence in the tundra or the muskeg please reconsider the huge empty land argument.	0

lucky to see the faith community stepping up. for me i have a hard time having any empathy for most homeless. when i take a walk around ala moana park, i see these young middle aged people just laying around or young men around mid 20s sitting on park benches smoking cigarettes and or weed. i often wonder why can't they go and get a job. if they have mental issues then why aren't they in a center or institution to get help? most all of these people had a chance at one time in their lives and either blew it off or whatever. if they were born with deficiences or developed medical issues that affected their mental functioning, i totally understand but most do not fit in that category. i see these beggers standing with their pathetic signs all day long. why don't they get a job if they can stand for 10 hrs acting and looking helpless and sad. pisses me off when i work my butt off as most of you readers/commenter do as well.	1

Harry, you must know that the civil war was not fought to free the slaves. Lincoln himself said that if he could preserve the union and not free the slaves he would do so. Emancipation was a tactic to win the war, to get slaves to revolt and join the Northern army, which many did. Many of America's corporate plutocrats, including Henry Ford & the Bushes granddaddy were big Hitler supporters. Hitler awarded Ford Germany's highest civilian medal for the help he provided in building up their military. Ford & GM both had truck factories operating in Germany throughout the war. George Herbert Walker (Bush 41's dad) was convicted of trading with the enemy, even after the war started. These fascist corporatists are not patriots -- their loyalty is only to profits for themselves. We sponsored regimes as murderous as the communist ones you quote -- if not in total numbers then in proportionate ones. We overthrew democracies in Guatemala, Iran, and Chile. Doing evil to oppose greater evil?	1

(2) He is totally ignorant about both the economy and foreign affairs. At a briefing with a Republican expert on military affairs he actually asked him, ""Why can't we use nuclear weapons? What's the point of having them?"" He wants to do away with NATO, a multi-national alliance that has held back Russian expansionism for 70 years. (3) He is a sociopathic narcissist who feels personally aggrieved whenever someone disagrees with him. As many Republican national security experts have noted, he should never be trusted with the nuclear codes. (4) He is a racist bigot who would tear up the US Constitution given half a chance, and (5) He is a tax cheat and a fraud."	1
Jobs didn't leave the US, but, some disappeared. Their argument is that we unfairly subsidize our softwood lumber industry, thereby giving it an unfair price advantage when competing in the US against US softwood lumber producers.

I agree with Governor Chris Christy insofar that a serious change is needed in dealing with opioid addiction. It is out of control and getting worse daily. Now that the opioid epidemic has been declared a state of emergency, they should start at the root of the problem and focus heavily on providing accessible emotional and mental health care, education and effective drug detoxification by qualified medical professionals. We cannot keep offering more space at the same failed drug treatment programs. We need to stop simply trying to manage the symptoms (addiction) and start focusing on the human being behind it. The only way to do so is through individualized counseling for emotional issues and effective health care. We have the knowledge and the resources; now we need the right priorities.	0

He had a getaway plan so says the sheriff in the very first paragraph of this report. He shot up a gathering of mostly white all American citizens. This would make him either a white person hating racist or an Islamic state jihadist.

Interesting how their stories seem to want to position the church as a piece of the solution. We just didn't know, but now that we do, we can help prevent abuse in the future... Apologies aplenty of course. Remorse and accepted responsibility for what happened BEFORE they themselves came... Statements that we act very differently now... And above all, no personal accountability for anybody who WAS in power. Again... Or still... Just a bit too facile for my blood... They speak boldly about the evils of clericalism, about the need for change. So maybe I'll find it a bit easier to believe the sincerity of these men when they bring about that change, when they commit their lives to bringing about real change in the church. Something this big means they need to rise above their local duties. That kind of commitment would Seem to be what's been missing for so long in the church. ...and why it's unlikely real change is gonna happen in my lifetime...	0

Hmm, does that sound vaguely similar to the ""I know Nothing"" Sergeant Shultz pronouncements from both Christie and Trump? Good points for Wray would be the 9/11 investigation and his roll in investigating corporate fraud, including Enron.

Perhaps the problem with Australia is that it took Vatican II SERIOUSLY during the decade after Vatican II, promulgating study and implementation of the documents at every level. The U.S. Church, however, only did this in several pockets of our country, depending on the traditionalist or Vatican II predisposition of local bishops and pastors. Therefore, most U.S. Catholics were ripe for the suppression of Vatican II implementation under Popes JPII and BXVI since they heard so little of the Second Vatican Council in the pews. https://RiteBeyondRome.com	0
Honestly, I think this really boils down to the evolution of Boy Scouting into a family-based activity. I married an Eagle Scout who went on to become an Assistant Scoutmaster long before we had children of our own. I soon joined in the fun as a Scouter, and when we became parents, our children of both genders wanted in on the action. It was painful for our daughter to be excluded, and the wait for Venture Scouting, which became available to her at age 13, felt like an eternity. We wanted very much to experience Scouting as a family, not as separate genders, and that appears to be true of many of our generational peers. Both organizations would be wise to think long and hard about how they can remain relevant, and if that means looking beyond single-gender programs, so be it. Our family would cheer the progress!	0

I don't want ANYTHING added to our public water supply that isn't necessary (like chlorine) to make it safe to drink. Chlorine is also easy to remove from water, by simply letting it stand out overnight. Fluoride is NOT easy to remove, but it is easy for those who desire it to access it via tablets or toothpaste. You say that we are free to request estrogen be added to our public water but would deny us the right to demand fluoride be excluded from it. I was being facetious and hypothetical to show how unfair your advocacy of forced fluoridation is, but it's impossible to change the mind of a man over an issue that affects his pocketbook, and you are most likely profiting handsomely from your shilling for Big Fluoride. That makes you a vile and despicable person, as well as a huge hypocrite.	1
"Mr. Milligan, How do you propose to address the issue of ""low-income"" wealthy families who rely on daycare as a perk, families in which one of the spouses (usually the mother) doesn't even work but their kids attend daycare for the educational and social benefits? In Vancouver, especially in the neighbourhoods near your workplace (UBC), this would not be an uncommon issue. Some such families already benefit from daycare subsidies and the Canada Child Benefit. I'm not criticizing your proposal; I'm just curious how you think this resulting inequality should be addressed. Perhaps our tax system should introduce some net worth test for social benefits, including for your proposed child-care tax credits and the existing Canada Child Benefit."	0

Opus Dei is a cult with a well-known conservative political agenda. If it's trying to help you achieve personal holiness, it's doing a poor job, since you lie, and refuse to apologize for these lies. If you really were working on personal holiness, you would have apologized to me months ago -- your honesty and humility are sorely lacking. YOU don't do banners and demonstrations. Other people do, YOUR agenda (dictated to you by your cult) does not apply to everyone. Since I refuse to belong to such a cult with its bankrupt spirituality (as demonstrated by your lack of decency) and its bankrupt politics (you are aware that it had close ties to the Spanish Falange -- a fascist government) there is no appeal to me as a rational person and as a Catholic. Does your pride drive your interior monologue -- it quite obviously does. If it didn't, you would have apologized for lying about me ages ago. Nope, you demonstrate that Opus Dei is crap, and should be avoided. This is my 5000th post.	1

It speaks volumes that liberal activist and fake reporter Denby Fawcett would refuse to actually interview any conservatives she named in the article when the entire article is about slamming conservatives. It also speaks volumes that the editors of Civil Beat find a lopsided hatchet job like this screed suitable for publication. For progressive Mrs. Bob Jones to turn herself into the 'savior' of the failed regime of liberals which has run the Hawaii GOP for decades is laughable. So is fawning all over those very RINO party leaders who have driven the state's Republican Party into the ditch. And don't even get me started on the dozens of factual errors in Ms. Fawcett's rubbish article. The only reason Civil Beat would certify this garbage as 'fit to print' is because attacking conservatives without ever speaking to conservatives is how they do business day after day.	1
The mix of “identity, foreign policy, Islamophobia and jihadi-Salafi ideology” is ‘volatile’ only for people who believe in the nightmarish fairy tales of Islam.

"No doubt there is racism here in Canada (and maybe racial profiling at the border). A co-worker of east-Indian extraction (he grew up in London, UK) remarked how he always got pulled aside at the airport for extra questioning. There wasn't much I could say, though going through the airport isn't much fun for anyone anymore (and less so in U.S. airports where the security people must suck lemons before going on each shift). I'd have thought showing your passport would have settled all questions about ""How long are you going to stay?"", though. (""Thirty six years, sir. I expect to die around the age of seventy eight."") (And I wouldn't try that joke in the U.S.)"	0
Thank you for putting Hawaii on the map for the wrong reason. Using public funds for your own interest should be a crime. The state is in turmoil as far as funding.

Hey - all you weasel rino politicians! There is an easy, low cost & painless way to solve the illegal alien invasion problem. It consists of two simple applications of an existing program. E-Verify is a program run by the Social Security administration. An employer enters the information about the person, and the system gives an immediate Yes or No answer.  1. The Federal government must demand that every company must clear EVERY new job applicant through E-Verify. Any employer who knowingly hires someone without using E-Verify is subject to felony prosecution with mandatory loss of their business license, and a minimum of two years of prison. Employers have up to two years to run existing employees through E-Verify. 2. ALL organizations which provide ANY form of tax-payer provided benefits, must also run EVERY applicant through E-Verify, with the same federal penalties and requirements. With NO job or benefits, 90+% of all illegals will pack up and self deport.	0

"After reading a little about this case, it's pretty clear that this priest was a homosexual with the common attraction thereof to pubescent boys, and that the boy who was participating in sex acts with this priest was likely a willing participant who saw the opportunity for a payday in his adulthood wherein he could rely on repressed memory (he was apparently ""raped"" on many occasions) as his reason for not reporting it when it was happening. The priest is not a pedophile in the clinical sense; he is a man with sexual attraction to pubescent males transitioning from boyhood to manhood. Indeed, that is how he describes himself. If you're going to track him, you have lots of other homosexual men to track who engage in sodomy with willing adolescent young men."	1

I agree. The irony is that people who are escaping over-populated, underserviced and polluted cities are turning Vancouver into an over-populated, underserviced and polluted city. Given their advantage in capital, they are displacing generationals from the quality of housing they once could afford into the expensive pigeon holes that are now their only option. As Doc, points out, Vancouver has become a shelter for people who have abused their own country, brought their ill-gained money to Canada and are now abusing our country by manipulating our laws and institutions to exploit us. Our government has invited a new level of corruption into our midst with open arms and is currently begging for more.	0

"Regarding :"" gay culture"" - This old phrase, 'particular friendships', might best explain what the old men in the Holy See want to address. - That is, secular clerics, as well as consecrated men and women, must avoid an, albeit natural, human tendency to have friends that are just like themselves. That is, they do not have an 'open' approach to relationships and thus act in an exclusionary manner. - In houses of consecrated religious, 'particular friendships', raise suspicions, isolated one religious from another and thus are divisive. - More diffused, but just as apparent, secular clerics who have 'particular friends' limit their own ability to be a brother to the brothers and sisters of Christ. - So, this document is best read if 'gay' or 'homosexual' is replaced with human."	1

"And so dies freedom of speech, which a so called news organization should be the first to stand up to support and defend! I for one will never watch CNN again for any reason and I advise others to do likewise (please take note advertisers, not that I am anything more than one person, the conservative mind set is just as valid an approach as any other and to openly bash it the way CNN does while calling that act of bashing ""NEWS"" is an afront to free speech). Their complete bias against anything of a conservative nature is so obvious anytime you watch it. I have known this for years, but have watched from time to time just to see what the liberals are saying, but no more. So long CNN, I hope you die and go down in the history books as a has been, a former worthy news organization that lost its way, and simply turned into an irrelevant liberal shill."	0
"The evidence of Trump's appetites even has an effect on the way his ""base"" pursues their attack dog tactics. Notice that the far right substantially avoids comparisons between Obama (the ""fit"" President), or George Bush (the active, brush clearing/bicycle riding President).

See the subconscious obsession with culinary things brought on by an irrational admiration of a President with obvious over indulgence issues? Opponents and even moderate adversaries have also caught on. Putin is newly showing off his bod, daring Trump to take his shirt off.

It takes a governor to ruin a splendid state. Gov. Walker is up to, or stoops mightily to the task. When Bill Walker even sinks below Gov. Frank Murkowski as in dropping the Murkowski $92 million claim against Exxon for long term damages to Prince William Sound resulting from the oil spill, one can only realize how far this governor has lowered the bar. Most galling is the lack of leadership to develop an Ak Board of Game that would truly serve the interests of all Alaskan stakeholders. Rather he has allowed it to deteriorate into an exclusive club of hunters and trappers catering to those interests, removing valuable keystone predators with industrial scale killing, turning wild land ecosystems into game hunting farms.That Alaska's splendind living wildlife should be a major building block to a permanent economy needing enlightened stewardship minus the controlling grip of Safari Clubs, the NRA, the Alaska Outdoor Council just doesn't register with Bill Walker.

You may even be the smartest guy in your circle of stupid friends, but you're still a stupid lapdog moron. Kinda embarrassing huh?

This has been seen in a variety of numbers...we have working class white males who for the last forty years have felt like they were losing ground...they are! Of course much of this was self-inflicted as they lead the way to elect leaders who tapped into their angst..angry Reagan Democrats, soccer Mom's, tea-party and now 'the undertoads.' In each case union jobs left, high paying work was automated, other groups seemed to been rising while they fell, and services that were paid for by a civil society (health, tuition, taxes) were increasingly resting on their shoulders...they were told this was freedom. No, it was stupid! It's time to hear their pain and not belittle it...it's real even if their own damn fault. So what can we do? First is to stop pitting each against the other. Working class black mem and white men have a lot in common...helping to raise families, paying for college, dealing with a spouse who works too. They also are dealing with changes. Let's help them do both!	1

This doesn't make any sense. It's economics 101 to understand that for a market to work - the cost of products must be reflected in their price. Right now, we unfairly subsidize all fossil fuels at the expense of our children and environment by letting them pollute for free. BC, Sweden, and many others have effective carbon prices. Price is way more effecient than subsidies - subsidies will actually cost YOU more to achieve any emission reductions. Take an econ class!	0

Dan: This Federal firearms law that they are being prosecuted under ( section Section 924(c) of the US code ) was originally created by the Congress for mainly dealing with violent drug traffickers. That is why it is so severe. It was not created for people engaged in dangerous armed political protest. There really are no laws that have been created to cover these kinds of acts, so the government has to use what is available under the law to prosecute.  Here is a link to a chart showing the sentencing guidelines for this law: http://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Chart-924c-gun-MMs-NW.pdf It is much like how the Hammond family was prosecuted under the Federal Anti terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. The crime created in that law that they were prosecuted under was originally created by the Congress mainly for punishing terrorists who destroyed Federal property. .	0

Even someone with a 3rd-grade background in arithmetic could see beyond this inane and blatantly manipulative tactic of yours. Did any of you even graduate from 3rd-grade?

That's a good way to tell, isn't it.

Even with outside consultants starting out saying it is a crisis, I don't believe anything will happen. It will take a bold set of actions which I don't think the mayor or council will be willing to do because it might run counter to the groups/individuals who consistently resist any actions to curb dysfunctional behavior. One bold action would be to divert the city hall money to establishing clinics/housing/shelters for the various constituencies. I tend to think that action would be a much better advertisement for this city than a shiny new object in the center of town that the various dysfunctional groups would call home. If shelter is provided, then we as a city could demand appropriate behavior downtown and enforce it. No camping in the parks, lollygagging on bike paths etc. that intimidate bikers etc.	0

??? Almost all the 9/11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. The other countries of origin for terrorists hitting the US in the last three decades are Lebanon, Egypt, and Pakistan. Not one of those countries made the list somehow. So it does kind of look exactly like they pulled their plan out of thin air (or their backsides) with no knowledge of US history, world events, etc. Now I know Trump will explain that all those thousands of Muslims tailgating on 9/11 he (and no one else) saw were Syrian and Iranian or some such silliness . . . but at a certain point even die-hard Trump supporters have to start cluing in to the reality that this guy either doesn't have the necessary mental capacity to perform a job that Dubya pulled off for eight years, or the stupid act is just a smokescreen to distract while he robs the public treasury blind for himself and his cronies.

That post-racial society has existed already for years. It isn't a new development. Spent a lot of time in Cabbagetown years ago. All races lived amicably in the building I was in. I think this constant push on race and racially charged identity politics is actually harming race relations. Equality is equality. Sending a specific group to the back of the room does nothing to further equality. Constantly taking the wrongs of the past and putting them back into today's context achieves nothing other then some smug, arrogant, self righteous and selfish feelings of self-affirmation for the one initiating the act, in this case the singer.	1

I don't know why this is being treated like a minor issue when in my mind it's the single biggest threat to life as we know it in Cape Town..I'd say damn near apocalyptic if this city indeed reaches day zero. Water is life and without it, no one can survive so why is there this lackadaisical approach? Why are the large-scale construction projects in and around the city still going ahead, where are they getting water from? Why are hotels, B&B etc still allowing people to bath, why are golf course's grass still looking so green and why are they still operational? Why are water guzzlers not just cut instead of continuously threatened, warned or fined? Telling us that other provinces are also facing drought doesn't help or make it better, I don't see a countdown clock in these provinces. Nomvula saying they can't allow the taps to run dry doesn't give me any comfort at all considering her department is technically bankrupt. God help us all, because hier kom a ding!	0

What people are not doing is facing facts. Obamacare isn't working. What the Republicans have proposed probably isn't much different. What the Republicans have talked about but didn't propose is needed - like opening it up for insurance carries to cross state lines. If Americans would stop and ponder the long-term issues of government controlling health insurance. Helping those who cannot afford insurance should be covered and those who can afford - even if they need to work two jobs need to pay part or all of their health care. Not sure what has happened to this country but it used to be take care of yourself - not any more people are looking for handouts. Our country has lost that drive to achieve on their own.	0

No. What has happened to our culture that that argument can even be made? Art is art when it is culturally relevant, when it tells us something about ourselves. It has a real function, or at least it used to. Perhaps it doesn't anymore, but that's a different argument. This piece in Huntsville is bad art. It says nothing, and people are right to be ""provoked"" to point out the obvious. Pointing out a piece of `art' is bad does not then, willy nilly, make it art!

I am torn on this ... On one hand I believe that swift action was necessary to bring home the fact that this was a very serious act, and one easily played down in the past. Firing the employee is a way to say that such behaviour is not allowed any more. On the other hand, this is the kind of thing that could be handled by mediation in which the two parties meet and hear one another. Out of that could come the opportunity for the school principal to say how much damage and pain are caused by use of the language the AHS employee chose to use. It would give principal the opportunity to decide, afterwards, whether she thought she had been heard, and the power to do something about it.	0

In my view, I don't know how that is possible, since protesters, whether this weekend's march participants, or today's kids are enjoying one of our most basic rights, and are taking part in the governmental process in a way that was expressly guaranteed to them by our founders. As a country we must be careful not to deride such a core aspect of who we are. To judge those who take action when they see injustice, is simply un-American.

The issue for schools and school districts really has little to do with whether students were exercising their free speech about an issue that may be political. The US Supreme Court decided decades ago that free speech rights do not stop at the schoolhouse door...BUT...if the expression of free speech causes a substantial disruption to learning in the school that expression may lawfully be banned. Was the picture or the taking of the picture disruptive? Was the sharing of the picture disruptive? These are the questions courts will consider if the district punishes the students for this action.	0
But the doctors do not fix them and it does not work. I don't care what sex someone wants to identity. I don't care how someone wants to dress. Such people may want to deny reality--and that is their business. That does not entail that I have to deny reality or that other people have to deny reality. That is my point. If a person who is clearly a man wants to identity as a women--and get a doctor to perform surgery to make the man look like a women, that is their business. That does not make them a women--and that is not an obligation on me to recognize them as a women. They can deny reality if they want--but I should not be forced to deny it, nor should the government.	0

Actually, Trevor's release time in the past has been decent, in fact, I just read something a week or so ago that stated his release time 2.5 was a tick faster than Brady's 2.6. I think the pressure to not turn the ball over that Kubes hammered into him combined with getting slammed on nearly every pass play has made him more tentative. I had hopes for the kid but he has regressed. I think part of it is that he's smart enough to know and understand McCoy's system, but he hasn't had enough reps in it to make the right choices automatically. He does well at checking out of plays so that shows he understands what needs to be done but maybe it was just too much on his plate? McCoy may have mistaken TS's understanding for being ready to implement it on the run so to speak. In any case, IMO, they should have brought him along slower, with less options.

... it's been happening since post Eisenhower. 1964 is when the Republicans greeted the racists and sexists with open arms. Dixiecrat infiltration paired with just 'normal' American racism, sexism, Hatriotism = modern Republicans.

Good point. I agree with you and stand corrected. I was referring to the Constitutional right to freedom of speech in a larger sense, but I agree with what you are saying here. You are right, they are in the workplace and have to abide by the rules of the employer as long as it is legal. That is why at Disneyland they are told how to dress and act by the employer/owners. It makes sense. The NFL is going to change the rules on this or they will be losing $Billions of dollars in multiple ways. You are 100% right. I will not watch them anymore if this continues. I have had it with these ungrateful people. I prefer the NBA anyway, and it is about to get going soon, ....I hope that they don't start doing this crap too.	1

Listen man, my ex husband grew up in a Podunk town in Washington that you sneeze and you would miss it; his step father beat him every day of his life until he ran away from home at 14 dropped out of school and worked a job. I met him at 18 and he never laid a hand on me in 12years of marriage. No one had to tell him beating your wife and children were wrong because he lived that abuse and never wanted anyone else to have to suffer like he did. I was beaten and raped regularly and didn't need anyone to tell me that I didn't ever want to beat or rape another person. So take that I didn't know garbage elsewhere. Also the military was big on being pretty vocal about views of domestic violence so how you spent 10years in the military and never knew that it was wrong? Please forgive me if I have a hard time believing that. Because at some level being beaten you had to know that you didn't want that to happen to anyone else. I have no sympathy for abusers or rapists	1
"Straight from the horses mouth. Ontario budget 2005 Page 159 https://www.poltext.org/sites/poltext.org/files/discours/ON/ON_2005_B_38_01.pdf ""PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS In 2001, the right to incorporate was extended to all regulated professionals. Under existing provisions, non-members of a profession cannot own shares in a professional corporation.

"You say you would ""rather not be ignorant"", but your posts belie that statement. If anything you glory in your ignorance, it fuels your opinions, it shows up in your every misstatement of fact. In this case, Gail Collins, a supervising editor of the New York Times, has accurately compiled a short list of the many stupid, ignorant and offensive utterances of our cheese ball president and put them into a quiz with choices offered that are no more nor less asinine than what Trump has actually said or tweeted. I suggest that you cherish your ignorance because it allows you to say ignorant things."	1
I'm not Orthodox. I'm Ukrainian Catholic. :-) I happen to agree with you that one can take away from an icon what one will. Most faithful -- whether Orthodox or Eastern Catholic are not experts on icons. But most of us (regardless of how much we happen to know) find spiritual guidance and comfort and focus in those icons. On the other hand, I think that it's important to try to learn as much as one can and to find out what the symbolism actually means. I think that understanding the symbolism leads to a much more wonderful and fuller experience of the icons and the spirituality that they hold. While no one can prevent others from interpreting as they will, I think that those who choose not to learn miss out much.	0
All these insults and no results. Perhaps you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a valid argument against Trump, rather than complaining you don't like his method of getting business done with powerful people.

"On a serious note, the Liberal party/Butts has done a masterful job of corralling the silliness that could have been apparent with things like Sophie's singing, or her complaining about a lack of servants (notice she has either disappeared, or says nothing when she is in public?)... So on that note, if Trump is a ""10"" on the disaster scale, Trudeau is a ""5"" or a ""7"", but a lot of that, is that Canada is fractionally prominent, compared to the USA, and it is much, much easier to bury a PM from the news cycle, than an ""executive"" like a President. Trudeau, is the big slow cousin at the summer BBQ family gathering - just give him a ball, and tell him to keep himself occupied in the back yard, and no one will notice..You can't hide Trump, its' his estate, he invited everyone over etc...

"Many songs from the 60s, 70s, and after and even before seem to be eternal in that we can sing the lyrics and the tune decades later. Even some good TV shows and movies have an almost ever-lasting feel to them....as they are shown on TV as reruns and we purchase DVDs to have in our collection for viewing again and again. - But sports is different, and that difference is what makes sports ultimately kind of stupid. There is little to no reason to want to care about saving memories of some game, or even some season, from years or decades ago. No TV channel will ever show, or DVD will ever sell, the ""complete game"" of a long-gone game from year's ago because, unlike enduring songs and many TV shows, ""sports"" is fleeting. Ultimately, once the season is over, interest in ""what was"" fades.....and we return to those things that are much more entertaining and enjoyable.....such as music, TV shows, and even movies from decades ago when we lost any interest in the football games from that time."	0

Two male friends can love one another with deep-seated emotion. Without the inclination to engage in sodomy with one another, they cannot be a ""gay"" couple. Sodomy is the key characteristic that distinguishes them from being just good friends."	1

The law is NOT well written. In that case do NOT allow it to pass. Forget 6 months to live, more like a Dr's decision should be when the person has only 6 days to live. The person would have to be already accepted in a hospice program, in excruciating agony without pain meds, already prescribed serious pain meds & ending the person's life is only like upping their morphine drip already in place. If someone really needs to commit suicide 6 months (which is ONLY a guess) in advance, medically assisted suicide should NOT be an option, however no one can stop them if they really want to end their life by jumping off a bridge or cliff. Not advocating suicide but that early on before the body actually would die on its own, don't make it easy. Robin Williams committed suicide & it was clear it was a conscious decision on his part in which he slashed his own wrists & overdosed on his medications.

There is always a statistical problem quoting %. From the data quoted and statscan numbers there were 6,875,610 people in French speaking families in 2011, 7,193,750 in 2016. Also PQ has had interprovincial out migration in the range of 20,000 per year (latest statscan # is 2011 and reported as an increasing number historically), which is a net loss of potentially 100,000 between 2011 and 2016 (although some of these could be recent immigrants moving out too). The change reported is 0.6% between 2011 and 2016 which is 48,000 on 8,000,000 (2011 population of PQ 7,903,000, 2016 population 8,326,100). Given some of the influencing factors this issue is not a magnitude worth discussion. Or 42,000 if you just want to count 7,000,000 people in French speaking families.	0
John, did you somehow miss the link to the 70 page PowerPoint that lays bare the lies about SB-21, and how it is costing Alaskans billions of dollars per year? Following the Alaska Constitution (Article VIII) and not giving away billions of dollars of our oil per year IS a credible solution, John. You think the corrupt bastards are going to stop giving away our oil once they have gotten their hands on our dividends and have imposed a income tax? Have a cup of coffee, read Dr. Robin Brena's presentation, and tell us if Robin made even one mistake. (He didn't).	1
Sir John doesn't seem capable of understanding much at all, other than a few select catch-phrases. Blaming the media is nothing more than mental laziness and an admission of an inability to think for oneself.	1

"Presidents have given formal condolences and tribute to BOTH active and retired veterans-- they clearly didn't care of the nature of their death-- that only means something to you, and only you. . You're actually asking if Kyle was more ""accomplished"" than the vast majority of veterans who have died-- which is, of course, asinine. He is racked and stacked with other heads of state that Obama did and did not go to-- the Washington Post wouldn't do that unless he was. Perhaps if you had served, it would make a little more sense to you-- it clearly does to President Trump, and he hasn't."	0

People keep on saying that the investigations should stop because there is no evidence of collusion. But the point of an investigation is to look for and obtain evidence.

If she is gay, more power to her. However, there is such pressure to be different, and she is so young, that she may not be. My daughter wrote me a letter at 16 telling me she was gay. I supported her, told her I love her no matter what. It turned out that she was not gay, just trying to wrap her head around feelings she was unsure of. Today at 25 she is happily married to a man, and they have been together 4 years. My point is this: don't judge your children no matter what. This is not a matter of choice, and when they're young, they need family support to figure it all out no matter if they are gay or straight.	0
As an English teacher, it is hard to find good literature without a dark side: Romeo and Juliet -- suicide, Lord of the Flies -- murder, Hamlet -- murder, even The Great Gatsby has murder. I really try to make sure we read great literature, but the human condition is not happiness and light. I try and balance deep literature with other positive things. Unfortunately, social media, literature, etc is not the cause of teen suicide. It is an amalgamation of many things. Kids today are under an extreme amount of stress and expectations. Look at what they are told matters: grades, sports, personality, clothes, activities -- everything can ruin your chances at college, and college is the only way you have a chance at being successful. Everything in our world has become 110% all the time. Kids need a chance to goof off, try things without fear of failure, they need to have adults who see them as people, they need to have more positive connections.	0
I guess some people would rather make a point than save a life, I get that. Maybe you hate your wife, I get that too. So what is you point? Is it that the guys suing are jerks? Okay? Maybe they are jerks, I do not know them. Too bad, some gays sued a guy for breaking a law he agreed to follow in writing. What is your point? If you think that people should not sue when their rights are violated, it is pretty easy to conclude you do not think rights are very important. You slso seem to think it is not important for the baker to follow the law. Sorry Big Guy, if I see you breaking the law, I am going to call you on it.

I'm not a lawyer and can't comment on the legality of the president restricting entry to the US, but as a general principle I think it's sensible to restrict Muslims from entering the US. Islam is inherently a violent religion (read the Quran, please). For years we excluded Communists for similar reasons. The fact that most of these Muslims aren’t ‘white’ is neither here nor there. For many decades the US excluded Chinese immigrants—not because of violence but because they had demonstrated thatthey tended not to assimilate—and,though I can’t speak to statutes, the Constitution has never been amended since that time in any way that would invalidate a simila national or ethnic-based restriction. The protections citizens have against discrimination (some of which were ‘read into’ the Constitution by activist courts, and certainly aren’t in the plain meaning of the text) simply do not apply to foreigners outside the country who desire entry.	1
Perhaps someday republicans will follow republican principles and instead of relying upon big government will rely upon the individual?

Righties keep accusing lefties of demanding free stuff, but when you unpack it, it is Righties who want ""free stuff"".

"""particularly in the Portland metro area"" This innocuous phrase is what it's all about. That area has its own city and county taxes as well as the Metro taxing district. They built a bridge over the Willamette that sits empty much of the time because it carries only mass transit. So now they, along with LTD, want a payroll tax on people in Heppner and Bandon to subsidize their mass transit. They want to tax kids' bicycles to put in more stuff like the path along I-5 and bridge to the Gateway Mall. What a quiet, scenic ride that is! Such paths are also for pedestrians, so I'm surprised they don't tax shoes."	0

There is tremendous anger out there right now, anger so great it is making rational polite political discussion very difficult, if not impossible. Much of the social media driving public opinion today, seems dominated by bully trolls, who seem to have endless time and are typically the most angry and opinionated media posters. They overwelm and poison the well of polite public discussion by pure volume, while providing few supporting facts or solutions. With the current poisoned discussion, based too much on emotion, raw anger, meaningless labels and political slogans, and little willingness to compromise, I am afraid for our future. Please, let's tone down the anger, be good neighbors who agree to sometimes disagree. We need to challange the obstructionists and find middle ground where possible. Compromise is absolutely necessary for a successful democracy. It is not necessary in a fascist dictatorship, which some seem to be currently seeking.	0

Even if the Chinese students pay $15K, the Canadian taxpayer still subsidizes them. It's so foolish and wrong, such bad policy, that allows up to 1/4 of students to be foreign. It also degrades the academic level, because foreign students always have some language and cultural difficulties (even when they are a large enough block that allows them to remain completely disassociated from Canadian students). In the case of Chinese students, they remain censored and under observation by the Chinese government, with some students tasked with reporting on others. From a Canadian perspective, it's a complete fail. What is wrong with our politicians and university administrators?	1

"I chuckled a few months ago when I heard all the exaggerated sighs of relief over Trump's comments that NAFTA just needed to be ""tweaked"". It was already obvious that Trump has a penchant for saying whatever pops into his head at any given moment, and the Canadian government (and media) were unwise to think that anyone could rely on any random comments he might have made. There are two separate issues here: whether supply management in the dairy industry is a good thing, and whether the Canadian government should allow itself to be bullied by the US administration. Trump's comments about supply management were unwise, because they will make it much harder for the Canadian government to think about reforming supply management without looking like they are capitulating to US bullying."	0

Of course he should have been tried for treason.

This is all to do with political correctness...can't be seen to be attacking an immigrant or a Muslim. That's why his father was allowed to come and go from Canada for his terrorist activities...that's why when the government knew that Omar and the other children were being radicalized that Child Protective Service did not take the kids. Ask yourself, if my father was raising my as a neo-Nazi/KKK member, how long with it take for Child Protective Services to show up? I mean a father in Ontario was abused by the police and Child Services because his daughter drew of him holding a gun in school...I guess if the gun were an AK or if he were building an IED Child Services wouldn't have cared!	1
I can't believe how many Alakans are buying this smoke and mirrors move. If it was a principled vote, it would have been in committee.

It's not, actually. Most European countries have very rigid, race-based national identities and aren't terribly receptive to immigrants.

The flagrant Islamophobia expressed by much of the French mainstream hardly serves to invite people to integrate.	1

President Trump is a con man. The leaders of most left and right organizations know that this executive order is all hat and no cattle. It was a memo, not a traditional EO with force of law. (For example, contigency plans for terrorist bombings are EO subjects, directing Cabinet secretaries to consider matters is a memo). Still, Trump voters are probably fooled. On LGBTQ issues, there is a difference between religious liberty and moral scorn. Firing gay people for getting married is the latter and has no justification. Indeed, it violates the religious liberty rights of gay couples. One aspect of the Gay Marriage decisions has been the consitutionalization of homosexuality as a protected class. Courts are now granting ENDA rights where Congress refused. Once they are done, there will be no compromise for religious organizations to engage in moral scorn and that is not a bad thing.	1

"Though some may frown upon this ""alleged"" behavior, it is the conduct of the Police I find most disturbing by coercion and misconduct by unscrupulous Law Enforcement by creating crime and Framing someone to circumvent due process. Thus, don't prejudge the JOHN until one sees what the sick minds of the Police themselves wrote to lure the Perpetrator. if EPD wants to truly ""conduct a sting operation targeting child prostitution"" then catch the REAL Prostitutes and their Pimps ~ instead of fabricating crime to justify their over-bloated budgets when true crime rates are down. I will never approve of such deplorable tactics by LEO's, nor of our FBI creating and running child porn sites (in their efforts to commit sting operations) So be warned, when you see Cannabis being sold on Craigslist, or answer an ad on any Singles site, it could be a middle aged pervert with a badge behind the keyboard. Sending people to jail over victims that never existed is what I find truly disgusting."	1
Encroachment, Encroachment, Encroachment. Coupeville OLF was established in 1943. Ebey’s Landing National Historical Reserve was established in 1978. So the Reserve, and all the other Johnny-come-lately property owners around the OLF, are the problem, not the OLF. The OLF was there first. How stupid does one have to be to establish either a Reserve or a homestead next door to an active airfield, and then complain about the noise.	1

If Trump is eating your brain, it is because you have shoved your head into his mouth. He runs the white house like he ran his campaign, it's all right there, you just don't want to see it. All of those off the cuff tweets and remarks are entirely on purpose. He is playing the media and the American political class for fools and they are walking right into it. Like or hate the man, he is a pro when it comes to media manipulation. American punditry is the boy in the Boy who Cried Wolf.	1

Thanks for your comments on my book. The problem with exposing bad laws is that you may give the impression of providing an excuse for those who obeyed them. There is no excuse. In the final chapter of the book, I acknowledged the courage of the Australian bishops in defying canon law with Towards Healing in 1996. However since the start of two major Australian inquiries, the current bishops have blamed their predecessors for the cover up, but have never acknowledged the defects in canon law that influenced the way those bishops acted prior to 1996. That courage has now abandoned them further. They sent Towards Healing 2010 to the Vatican for approval. In 2013, the CDF told them that mandatory reporting was fine for everyone else but not for clerics. Instead of standing up to the Vatican, they amended Towards Healing in 2016 effectively acknowledging that cases against clerics are still covered by the pontifical secret wherever civil laws don't require reporting.	0
I hope the Binkley's have already figured out how to print the paper. If they have not, their $1 million is toast. Newspapers like the ADN will not survive online only. Too many local news source alternatives. The paper is expensive to produce but could eke out a profit. This will not happen if they do not have a cost-effective print operation. Suggest they do not deal with GCI beyond the lease expiration. Also, do not buy Alice's press. Both will be money sucking losers.	1
Not saying anybody needs reading comprehension but I don't feel the same way about the players as I do Trump either. It's their actions that I equate. Both sides believe being disrespectful is a great way to communicate. I have no problem with them talking about whatever issues their hearts desire but a lot of people view what they are doing as disrespectful and thus their message is lost. If they want people to be respectful of them and listen to what they have to say then they should afford the same courtesy to the 1% of Americans who choose to serve this country in our armed forces - and realize that when people you know or maybe actually seen have died defending this country the flag means a little more to them. Correct message, wrong avenue.	0
For F A R too long, the L!BTards have been creating news to make their positions look good. They steered the conversation as they deemed necessary to make their points. Truth was not relevant.

The issue before the Supreme Court is not whether individual students will be accepted by the LSUC - it's whether TWU's possible future law school will be accredited, given the rules it says it will require of all students. In fact, there is a procedure for non-accredited law schools to request that their students be assessed by the LSUC on an individual basis. We don't know what the LSUC's answer would be because TWU has never asked. The LSUC had a statutory duty to make sure that accredited law schools do not discriminate in their admissions policies. This was the right decision, and the only decision they could have come to given their statutory mandate.	0

It ignores it is because that context is entirely irrelevant. That was what that history lesson was teaching you. To CLAIM that the cold war was a legitimate consideration in these events - is to repeat Coughlin's propaganda. It was a lie when he said it. It's a lie when you say it. We have proof that Coughlin believed his own lie. Later that same year when Hitler signed his friendship pact with Stalin, Coughlin recanted his support for the Nazis. He didn't realize Hitler was playing Stalin for a fool - and if fascists were forming alliances with communists then he could no longer support them. Perhaps you too, like Coughlin, believe the lie. Perhaps you truly believe that the threat of Russia justified dealing with the fascist NP government. But it's still a lie, even if you believe it. It doesn't fit the facts. Coughlin was wrong in 1938. You are wrong today.	1

"Mike: I agree with you one hundred percent. The Catholic Hierarchy continues to want to deal with those of us who were abused on their terms. They want to pray for us, pray with us, hold Healing Masses for us and never ever do they ask us what we want. They do not ask because basically they do not care. When they pray, I suspect they pray that this whole subject could be forgotten. In February of 2016, I attended a ""healing circle"" held in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. It was held in a private home, far removed from Churches, prayers and the Hierarchy. About a dozen members of the laity, three survivors and two priests attended. It was an eye opening experience for me. I came away convinced that the Hierarchy will never be part of the solution. It will be the laity and some priests who will eventually deal with this crisis. If anyone is interested in attending one of these "" healing circles"" go to the Voice of the Faithful website and contacting Bill Casey."	0

"From the article: ""In the minus column, he isn’t well known outside his home province,"" ======== That is an understatement. Even in Ontario he isn't all that well known, being the deputy leader of the 3rd place party and one who only came into Provincial politics a bit over 5 years ago. It is really only after the 2014 Ontario election, when his name was being tossed around as a potential leader for the Ontario NDP following Horwath's disappointing performance, that he started getting some recognition here. That being said he does seem to tick off all the right boxes for a good leader of the NDP. He is charismatic and well spoken. He can connect well to youth (and isn't all that old himself) and has been pushing for all the right kind of causes to get people to support him. He might well be the best NDP candidate so far, though I'm still not sure that it's enough to propel them beyond 3rd party status? I'm not so sure."	0

"Trump has surrounded himself with a team of bold, brave, prolific, determined, unabashed liars -- Spicer, Conway, Sanders, Pence, et alia -- especially Pence. While it is easy, and correct, to designate Trump as the Liar-in-Chief, I think he is better understood as the Bullsh*****-in-Chief."" Several years ago, Harry G. Frankfurt published a book-length essay, ""On Bullsh*t"", in which he distinguishes between a liar and a bullsh*****, A liar knows the truth and is deliberately trying to communicate a falsehood. A bullsh***** neither knows nor cares what the truth is; he says only what he thinks serves his purpose in the moment. Trump knows, believes and cares about very little, other than about Donald J. Trump; he just conjures up bull in the moment. Consider the nonsense he is sending his team of liars out to try to diffuse the despicable lie about Obama wiretapping him.

Rep. Eastman is a graduate of Trump University. He has learned to say the most evil and nasty things…barely disguising them so he can sort of deny that’s what he really meant.

He is “unabashedly pro-life”---permission for him to speak in easily decipherable racist code even his most ignorant constituents can understand.

Why not invest 100% of the non performing assets in the ERS into the rail? After-all, you government union workers voted ""D"" and for the rail so it must be a good investment right? Why not put your money where your mouth is and invest in the rail so you can reap the massive profits from the rail in the future?"	0

"I share your hope, but I think that writing columns for a blog that is generally dismissed by the bishops is not the best strategy. The bishops will not begin to pay attention until their livelihood is threatened: either by denying them the resources they need to maintain the status quo, or by openly challenging them in the courts, where they would be forced to respond. To a second point: I would not be so inclined to assume that Latinos will be the future of the church in this US, especially since, as Winters says, the Latino population is young relative to the general Catholic population. Latinos are experiencing the same tugs at their loyalty all millennials are going through, and there is considerable evidence that they will join the Nones Legion in force as time goes on. In my family, my generation continues to attend Mass, although about half are involved in ""irregular"" unions, but few of our children have anything to do with church."	0

If the other states legalized it, there would be less and less of these problems. The effects of prohibition of alcohol were the same, but the difference is POT is non-toxic and is and can be healthy for people especially if used properly. The synthetic form of THC is Marinol and is FDA approved and patented and used to help cancer patients get their appetite back. The other major pot chemical is CBD.....zero side effects and saves lives, literally, fights memory loss, fights dementia, helps PTSD sufferers, no side effects, fights pain, again.....no side effects.  There will always be supply and always be demand. It's completely idiotic NOT to figure out ways to make supply, demand, and the bridge between....SAFE for everyone, and that is legalize the hell out of it, regulate safely and reasonably tax it. Don't allow politicians and other industries to keep the shadyness around for greedy and stupid reasons.	1

Whoever told McDonald to run with that should put on his dunce cap and sit facing the corner for a good long while. Legislators, and all public and elected officials, are accountable to anyone who challenges their misconduct and malfeasance - which this article clearly describes. Period. That includes investigative reporters, engaged citizens, and watchdog groups, among others. The senate and house leaders who approved the travel plans of lame duck legislators who didn't return to the legislature should reimburse the state and pay for those travel and lodging costs with their personal money...then next time, they might think twice about approving them. Most of these legislators voted to use and continue to support plans to use our PFD's to satisfy their addictive spending and travel indulgences...all on our dime or the dime of moneyed interests.

Whenever a Republican is brave enough to go on their station their ""reporters"" turn all wolfpack on them, you can see it in their body language, tone, questions asked, etc. Their goal is not to report the news fairly, their goal is to get Trump impeached, simple as that. Whether you support Trump or not, this is not news reporting and is indeed dangerous to the republic."	0

"Well Margaret - personally I have absolutely no sympathy for Morneau. He was elected to serve his constituents. I'm sure that many of his constituents are doctors, small business folks and, just perhaps, even friends who could have been impacted by this legislation. Before being conned, brow-beaten or what ever by the Liberal brain-trust led by Gerry Butts, Morneau should have used some common sense to ascertain just how widespread the problem was he's trying to fix. And, why wasn't he at least concerned about that word ""trusts"". Surely in his working life he must have been aware of ""trusts"" and their application for tax savings - after all his family has many for just that purpose. Which brings us to another telling point. I'm sure that you and I, as well as most Canadians, would have had some serious conscientious thoughts about ""Why am I doing this to the people that create the majority of the private sector jobs in Canada?"" and not doing it to my trusts? No sympathy here!"	0

"From the other side of the ice.... Only saw the back half of the first period (""What?! They're already down 2-0?!"") and all of the second, but was not impressed with what I saw from the Bruins last night. The Sens clogged up the neutral zone and kept the Bs from getting into the offensive zone. Worse, too many times the Bruins turned over the puck just before getting out of their own zone. There was a lengthy stretch near the end of the second period when the Krejci line kept getting stuffed by the Sens and twice wound up icing the puck just to relieve the pressure. Kudos to the Sens for all that pressure and hard work, but still.... With the loss, the Bruins invite the return of the yapping pack of almost-there playoff hopefuls (Islanders, Leafs, Bolts, etc.). They need to beat up on the two lower teams they play next at home (Detroit & Philly) before the Western Canadina swing against a resurgent Vancouver and the return of Death Valley, Alberta."	0
"""School choice"" is actually code speak for ""school choice"". No attack involved.

Susan, that was a wonderful editorial however clearly you haven't been paying attention to the endless stream of propaganda spewing from pot activists. If you did, you'd know that stoners are simply awesome. They wouldn't hurt a flea. They never, ever, ever, ever drive while high and if they do, they're a million times safer than regular drivers because they're so gosh darn careful. Those stories you read about the increase in accidents since pot was legalized are wrong. Legalizing pot eliminated drug crimes. Those stories about recent pot deals and shootings gone bad are lies planted by anti pot forces. The stories about stoners selling Washington pot in other states in direct violation of the law are wrong too...gosh they would never do something silly like that. /voting against the legalization of pot was definitely in my self interest //why do you think they call it dope?	1

"""As an 18-year-old, your parents have no legal right to talk with your professors without your permission"" The parents can talk to anyone they want, with or without any third party's permission.

It's also for any student who is ""attending an institution of postsecondary education"". A 14-year-old who has graduated from high school and is now attending Harvard has the same privacy rights as a 24-year-old.

Lost in the long list of problems with our Imperial Overlords' LED streetlights (too bright, too blue, unshielded, too much glare) is the fact that they are the exact same spectrum as modern car headlights and bike lights. With these lousy LED lights, as our incompetent motorists glance down the street while running red lights and stop signs they won't be able to discern if the coast is clear of if there is someone coming. Oh sure, our motorists could actually stop at the stop signs, but without any traffic law enforcement that's just not going to happen. Street lights should be put in place for the population we have, not the one we wish we had. Just another instance of Eugene's Imperial city staff undermining policy as set by elected officials. Remember staff, we are supposed to be encouraging walking and cycling, not making it more dangerous. This is how we lost 37% of our cycling community back to cars.

And considering his dismal performance as POTUS, in retrospect he was never fit to hold the country's highest office. It seems that his supporters don't even care that Obama took the country to war–twice–without consulting with Congress, yet when his successor just speaks about defending our country from a chubby little brat with a nuclear weapons, those who supported Obama are shocked, SHOCKED, that the POTUS is considering military action. Hypocrisy. In its highest form."	0

The growth markets are in places like China, India, Brazil, etc and if Trump plays stupid like he's suggesting with import taxes then these countries will do the same to American cars therefore negating and huge opportunity for Ford, GM, and Chrysler to grow.

Canadian policy needs to be developed to serve our own interests. It would be foolish to develop policy just because others are doing it. The current US leean towards protectionism is a perfect example of what we don't want to do. But looking at the larger picture, David has not commented on the accelerating trend in our economy, or in our two economies really. The stats show overall we're doing alright, but they mask the undeniable fact that the top 10% are doing better and better while the middle 70 percent are stagnating or falling backwards. This may only be a temporary trend, but looking around the world suggests otherwise. And if we lose a significant chunk of the middle class....watch out!	0

"ScienceDuck: You're seeking ""civil conversation"" on this site....oh, wait a minute, that's the name of the site, isn't it. C.J.101's position is really rather simple....civil? well no, but certainly simple. If you disagree with him, it's because you're a)ignorant (don't have the facts) or b) stupid (couldn't understand those facts if you had them) or c) both of the above. Discussion, coversation and debate are all worthwhile pursuits. Dismissing those who oppose your position as ignorant, as does CJ101, contributes nothing and, instead, inhibits such civil discourse."	1

"What is the source of your data? Wikipedia, using data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime give figures for homicide rates per 100,000 population of 0.98 (Australia, 2015) and 4.88 (US, 2015). And there are easy to find critiques online of trying to compare general categories such as ""violent crimes"" because the definitions of violent crime in different countries are different. You might want to also look at the SNOPES examination of the meme that Australia's violent crime rate increased after their gun ban in the early 1990s. That claim has been pretty thoroughly debunked. In terms of firearm (gun) related death rate per 100,000 population, Wikipedia reports rates of 1.93 (Australia, 2013) and 10.54 (US, 2014). In other words the US rate of gun related deaths is over 5 times higher in the US. And since I expect you'll post something about suicide, the comparative rates for gun-related suicide deaths are 0.74 (Australia, 2013) and 6.69 (US, 2014)."	0
Rompe, It's also quite possible that those who were raised in the 60s-80s had a lot more insight and training on Vatican II: not the Vatican II workover done more recently by the neocons who want to rewrite history, but from the history as it was being made. Many of us saw what was possible in the church. Many of us heard the call from the bishops to take accountability for our own spiritual lives, and to not let others make our decisions for us. Many of us felt the excitement that coursed through the church, read what the theologians were saying, listened to those who were there. If nothing else, a takeaway of seeing what could be possible in the church was a powerful, life affecting kind of moment in our lives. So the church since then has been a rather large disappointment. We saw what could and should be. Alas, the efforts to smother all of that have also snuffed out a LOT of individuals as well.	0
"Motley, yet again, this is, thank God, America and not Saudi Arabia. Lets' look at what AMERICAN Islamic leaders have to say about the Orlando massacre: “Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers are with the victims and their families... This is a hate crime, plain and simple. We condemn it in the strongest possible terms. It violates our principles as Americans and as Muslims,” Nihad Awad, CAIR's National Executive Director, said on Sunday. ""We will not give into hate. We will not give into fear,” he added. Awad insisted that Daesh is an outlawed group which doesn’t represent Muslims. ""You do not speak for us. You do not represent us. You are an aberration, you are an outlaw ... they don't speak for our faith. They never belonged to this beautiful faith,"" he said. "" Do you have a problem with this Motley? I don't."	0

Glad to see you caught up to 1999. Background checks are required for all purchases. Of course the gun control lobby loves arguing their 'common sense regulations' as the law is currently and then passing a law significantly more restrictive. Of course then they complain when the courts smack them down on violations of the 14th, 2nd, 4th, and 10th amendments and commerce clause of the US constitution. You will note that a background check stopped not a single murder or mass murder yet.	0

"You make a good point: Not all Democrats are as clear as Sen. Sanders in articulating health care as a human right. In general, of course, most of them advocate policies that are by many orders of magnitude better than those of the Republicans. But Bernie brings the intellectual consistency and a deep understanding of the issues that few people in public life, in either party, seem to have. Paul Ryan has pronounced himself ""encouraged"" by the CBO scoring of his proposed health care legislation. How can he be encouraged by a projection that up to 24 million people will lose health insurance -- 14 million of them by the end of next year? Because the increase in the budget deficit and the savings of health costs for the poor and middle class will be transferred to the wealthiest persons in our society -- thus advancing the Republican economic and social agenda, as always on the backs of the poor and middle classes. Ironically, many of those harmed will be people who voted for Trump."	0
Just another in a long list of reasons that I really don't care about this writers opinion. I don't think it is his opinion, to be honest. I think he writes stuff like this to get a reaction.

Crimea was conquered by the Russians from the Tartars. Greeks were in Crimea 2500 years ago, Italians have a claim they built a fortress in Sudak 11 century.

"Well, the Chinese-Canadians ain't complaining. And maybe FN shouldn't, either. During ""John A""'s time, the American CPR contractor persuaded 15,000 Chinese to come work for half the wages whites would expect to work for--could he have found enough willing to work in some of the railroad's worst conditions. Working conditions? An estimated 4 Chinese died for every mile they built--about 700 dead. Then, after the first train chugged into Vancouver, the bad news kept on coming! Chinese were immediately unemployed--and basically unemployable. So, they all left to go back to good ol' China, right? Ha! Life was STILL better for them here than there--only about one thousand went back ""home."" Sir John A was a ""bad guy"" to First Nations peoples? Not so.

Leitch is floating a vague sentiment disguised as a specific policy. That sentiment is empty of content and, at first blush, might appear harmless and useful to many Canadians but anyone paying attention will soon observe that: 1. There is significant and almost universal disagreement regarding what values should be listed in any public document that would be consulted when adjudication a prospective immigrant's application. 2. Absent such a concrete list of values, the proposal lacks any foundation upon which it can be evaluated (save to conclude that, at best, it is vacuous and, at worst, it is a demagogic device to try to make xenophobia appear somehow nice and guilt free). Whenever Leitch is cornered with the inadequacies of her 'proposal' she simply adds some new item to the list in order to squirm out of the corner. What does that tell you?	0

I still think that it all the proposed campaign finance reform should come from a non-partisan party as oppose politicians writing up rules and negotiating behind close doors. One certainly won't do any electoral reform this way, right! There seems to be an awful lot of finger pointing - Greens saying that they didn't have anything to do with it and the BC NDP flipping and flopping and the BC Liberals aping the opposition platforms to cling to power. All they had to do was empower the folks at Elections BC to look and suggest bipartisan campaign reform rules and even electoral reforms for a fairer system for all participants (include businesses and labor unions as well) in a democratic system. Probably should not completely banned businesses and unions outright but set stringent limits. I think democracy is healthier if all participants have a degree of participation. These issues shouldn't really be politicalized this way. The optics are really bad.	0

"Perhaps Mr. J has a poor or selective memory, or simply a short attention span, and has already forgotten that my initial comments about this CB article, which I posted 16 days ago, already answered the hypothetical rhetorical question he asked in his most recent reply above.

Hence, my growing personal interest in stimulating more thought and discussion about the pros and cons of intentionally accelerating the death spiral by intentionally accelerating grid defections by ALL Hawaiian Electric customers as we make a hopefully proactive, rather than reactive, transition to a ""grid-free"" future:)"	0

Chávez and Trump had similar feeling about illegal immigration. Trump could care less that they helped break up the unions. In the end, the solutions espoused by Chavez supporters vs. Trump supporters are worlds apart. Trump is all about demonizing and prefacing them as enemies for his political purposes by claiming he will build a wall and deport them (while at the same time employing this labor in his hotels, etc). Chavez supporters would love to allow a path to citizenship for millions here illegally and see them unionized so they cannot be taken advantage of. Don't pretend Chávez and Trump are the same animal.	1
I've come across other claims that dogs are one of the few, if not the only, species that has evolved to understand human emotions through facial cues. A dog will look you in the eyes to understand your intentions. Dogs understand when you're happy, angry, or distressed simply by looking at you, no so much by your overall demeanor. A cat can understand you shouting and making menacing movements, but it will probably still climb in your lap indifferently for warmth if you're crying. A dog will actually understand you're upset. The interesting thing is that we've done this at a genetic level through selection. If you look at a wolf and a pug and consider the differences in appearance and behavior it's pretty fascinating. Especially in the short amount of time it's taken. One of the reasons I've heard for why dogs are like this and cats are not is because we selected dogs for this behavior, whereas cats have selected us. We weren't as involved in selecting which cats we wanted.	0

"and sales tax. If these are implemented then the State of Alaska captures all personnel earning wages in Alaska including those who live in the lower 48. The same with the Statewide Sales Tax which would also capture all tourist coming to the state. I would suggest a 5 1/2 % Income Tax and a 4.0 % Statewide Sales Tax. Alaska has had a State Income Tax before and we survived and we'll survive this one as well. Also, state employee production is hideous. Being a state employee is not a meal ticket to loaf in the halls, grab-assing, nor a social media gathering place. State employees are there to work and serve the people of Alaska.

In terms of the essay on post-racialism, for example, in what law enforcement environment is it OK for an FBI agent to state that the target of an investigation was a “'...retarded fool,' who doesn’t have '...a pot to piss in,' while other agents discussed prosecutors' penchant for Hollywood endings.""

Regarding Russia, it is one of the slimiest and most-corrupt nations on earth - from its leader Putin down to its taxi-drivers. Don't ever ""trust"" Russia fully. In the U.S.A, the nearest Congressional elections are in only 18 months and if the Republicans continue to stumble badly before them, they could lose their majority in the House of Representatives. Trump - or his successor Pence - won't be able to get things through Congress easily at all.

Great news. Sanity is being restored in the military services. Since Obama ended the ban on transgenders in the military, the military services have diverted much time and attention away from combat readiness to transgender education and indoctrination programs to force their acceptance and have spent a lot of money reconfiguring living accommodations in buildings and on ships to accommodate them. The decision to provide them medical care and medical procedures to change their sex at taxpayer expense was even nuttier. Sex reassignment is a lengthy and expensive process during which those undergoing the procedure are away from their jobs for medical consultations, pre-op procedures, hospitalizations for multiple operations and lots of time off for recovery and post-op treatments. The primary mission of the military services is national defense. Guys like Clinger were fine for MASH, but not for the real Army. Social experiments need to stay in the private sector.	0

The oil companies told us that if SB21 was passed it would create more jobs and increased state revenue. They didn't offer any qualifiers like the specific per barrel price of oil...they flat out said SB21 would increase revenue to the state and create more jobs in the industry. Now...less than three years after the passage SB21, oil industry jobs are down over 16% and state revenue from oil has most assuredly not increased...quite the contrary. Its time to end this corporate welfare and repeal SB21. Too many Alaskans supported SB21 back in '14 but even they have to admit now that they got conned. Nothing the industry promised has come to fruition. One of the first orders of business in the new legislature should be a repeal of SB21.	0

Incorrect and absolutely false information that you are spreading. The statute of limitations CANNOT BE WAIVED! However, the statute of limitations STARTS when the fraud is or SHOULD HAVE BEEN discovered.  So if the statute of limitations is 10 years to make it easy: Fraud that happens in 1980 or 2016 but was discovered in 2017 would have to be charged by 2027. If fraud happened in 2001 and was discovered in 2004 then charges could no longer be filed because the timer ran out in 2014. If fraud happened in 2001 and an audit was done of those years in 2002 and fraud was discovered in 2017 the statute of limitions would have run out in 2012 as the audit should have detected the fraud. So the government could be up against one or another statute of limitations timeframe or another already if it is looking back at something it first started investigating in 2014.	0

This analysis is very flawed. It focuses on the lowest income percentile and of course limiting the PFD to $1000 is regressive. But what else do the lowest income percentile receive from the state? They qualify for medicaid which is $7000 per year per person. If they have kids education funding is $20,000 in urban and $30,000 in rural alaska. Medicaid and education take up a majority of the annual budget. If we can't use our savings to produce revenue and have to cut these programs what is at stake here? Family of 5 - $35,000 in medicaid, $60-90,000 in education. $5,000 lost in PFD income. Do the math.	0

"When BLM staged its extortion coup d'etat against the LGBT community of Toronto, Wynne, Tory and Trudeau were all at the Parade but abandoned the actual ""GAY"" community to BLM. They even tacitly agreed with BLM that the white gays of Toronto really are a pack of racists. As always, the gays of Toronto were thrown under the bus for political convenience. It’s like the 1980 bathhouse raids all over again as elected officials refuse to fight this injustice done to us homosexuals. Ironically, the cops are now our only ally. Not even lesbian Wynne would dare come to our aid."	1
"Thank you so much for these reports. The Globe has discovered the new version of ""statistics don't lie but liars use statistics."" In the province of Ontario agency and in particular tribunals are above the law. They are not guided with protecting citizens but providing media reports to the public to make their agency appear to be doing a very valued duty to the public. In spite of good men and good woman who do their jobs in government agencies the very same organizations use media releases and public information as press releases. As a Whistle Blower recognized by Canadians for Accountability, I have met many who have exposed corrupt agencies such as the Foster Care in Canada and schools who have forced outrageous abuse on the most vulnerable, children. Please keep digging through the actions of these terrible agencies who do little more than self promote their own value while they knowingly allow convicted criminals to have access to children. Please help the innocent!"	0

Trump / Boeing do not like to be outplayed. You have not seen the last of it. Over the past 20 years China has hollowed out the US small and medium size industry, and its cheap educated labour has attracted the production of US Big Business to its shores. Aerospace - gone. Railways - gone. Automobile - gone. Nuclear - gone. Phone, Computer, Electronics - gone. Chemicals - gone. Tools - gone. Oil and Agriculture aside, the only bright industrial spot left was Armaments and large Civil Aviation. With F-35 in trouble, and Boeing attacked at both high and low ends, what is left? Even in Agriculture, Russia challenges American Genetically Modified / Processed with Organic. Rather than stress education that America has neglected over the last 50 years, they answer with Trump's suicidal isolation, and Boeing laments. Will it work? It is a headache for Canada. We are stuck with an angry neighbour slowly going broke. In not too far future that leads to what else - war. Are we ready?	0

I actually think they are timing this to be announced just prior to the election. Quite common for governing parties to announce big spending commitments before the election so you have a reason to vote for them. Blame the election cycle. If they committed the money now, opposing parties would claim the governing party has run out of ideas, or has a weak platform. That's just democracy.	0

There is a special club of hypocrites whose members include J. Edgar Hoover, and Ted Haggard (to name a couple out of many). Milo Yiannopoulos is part. Can you spot the link? All are, or were, active homosexuals who spoke out against homosexuality. J. Edgar Hoover had Clyde Tolson. Married Rev. Ted Haggard had sex with men. Milo Yiannopoulos thinks same-sex marriage is wrong, and wishes that homosexuals would go back in the closet (while loudly proclaiming he's not a white supremacist for reasons I'll let you inquisitive readers discover). Remember the racist skinhead, Nicky Crane? Nicky Crane performed in gay pornographic videos and died of AIDS. There's Ambrose St John and John Henry Newman (a poignant finish to their secret life together was revealed when the Vatican tried to separate their remains--buried together in the same grave--for Newman's beatification. The coffins had decomposed, and their bodies had finally mingled). Milo's hypocritical, tawdry dragface is irredeemable.	1

"I agree that something is seriously wrong with higher education. Expense-wise, college education is rising faster than health care. Most students are ill-formed, and come out more self-focused (and oddly more) confident than their acquired virtue and skill set supports. Very little maturity occurs. No depth, no wisdom (seeing matters in a wider perspective), no real service mindset. I don't mean there aren't sociology students that come out wanting to hold protest signs and change the world for a year or two before becoming hit over the head by reality. Higher education is a failed state. The ""special studies"" majors are only part of the problem. The whole field of scholarship has suffered. Faculty churn out silly studies year after years, and whole cliques form where they self-reference each others' silly studies, inflating 'citation indexes' (see Thomson Reuters products) making these largely un-reproducible ""studies"" appear to be more influential than they really are."	0

Unfortunately, they mix the metaphor, but ""separate envelopes"" - hospital, long term care home, physicians, and one might add, home care - are the silos. Each represents a distinct bureaucratic program of policy and funding. Dollars flow through the program rather than follow the patient, and separate rules and regulations hinder or prevent coordination. Hence, the metaphor ""silo""."	0

"Thanks, that's helpful. It's useful to differentiate between ""quality"" and ""civility."" To me, ""uncivil"" is low quality from the get-go (even if I might agree with a namecaller otherwise). I can think of a lot of different ways people might rate ""quality"": for instance, whether a post is ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" or fits some other ideological bent. Some people want to cheerlead for ""their side"", and diss the ""other side"" and see ""quality"" through that filter. My own definition of ""quality"" has more to do with whether a post is based in facts & makes intelligent arguments or comments —that might even sway my thinking, if I started with a contrary view.

Are those small provinces (or countries) with mild climates?	0
Oh Jeffrey, it is disturbing that you continue to hold forth with your crap. You are numerically deficient. You obviously cannot add up 1 plus 1. Have a good look at the comments on just this one article. I bet ya that there is in NO WAY that 90% of comments support 45. If anything, its possibly 25% or less, which is even less than the 45% who voted for him. Then there is the immigrant etc ban, and YOUR FIRED Mr Flynn, check the comments on stories about those two. True, there is no surprise how 45 is depicted, for he is a f..... up idiot.	1

All I am saying is that your 'target acquisition system' malfunctioned. You want to kill the people who weren't involved and are trying to atone for the mess of others instead of the low-life scum-sucking dogs (to give them the benefit of the doubt) who actually made the mess. You 'knee jerked' because they were frat rats. It's sort of like saying 'all blacks', 'all women'. You are saying 'all Frats' are evil just because they are frats even when they weren't involved.	1
It’s just a weird series of coincidences based on his not knowing any better that he hired a bunch of Nazis to his staff, won’t distance himself from the Klan, hired Kobach and Hans von Spakovsky and Jeff Sessions and his only governing principle is overturning everything President Black Man did.

One of the deciding factors could be availability of a large appropriately-located and serviced piece of land. In that regard, Toronto's docklands is ideal - close to downtown, on the water, very big, and more or less a blank slate for redevelopment. I'm guessing it would stack up well compared with many US cities. As for the taxes issue, I think the key issue will be corporate and property tax deals, not employee personal taxes.	0

"""...enlighten us all on how you lower the deficit and debt by cutting the taxes for the top 1%."" I have never made any such assertion, that would seem to be in your imagination. I do not dispute that Pres. Obama inherited the Great Recession economy. The fact remains that the national debt grew nearly $8 trillion during his two terms. And that entitlement programs are consuming about 67% of the federal budget annually.

Interesting article, as usual, Pierre. Still, isn’t there a possibility that the NPA could mount a bogus prosecution by presenting a contrived case that is so weak and disjointed as virtually to guarantee acquittal of the accused? If so, upon acquittal, double jeopardy would apply, preventing any further prosecution on the same charges. An added advantage would be that the NPA gets a superficial sheen of doing its job “without fear or favour,” even if the presiding court official were to rap them over the knuckles about the poverty of the case they presented. Or is there something in law besides the NPA’s duties that would prevent such a gambit? (I realise that we live in cynical times here in SA, and that the above thinking stretches the cynicism quite a bit farther.)	0

At least until 2018 (and maybe even after; we don't get to know), impeachment is in the hands of the majority Republicans in the House and the Senate. And the Amendment 25 solution, which would be to recognize that the current president is unfit to execute the duties of the office, depends on his cabinet. That one seems highly unlikely, although some say the reason he's flailing about with his appointees is fear of Amendment 25. But does he have the intellectual capability to deal with that level of nuanced strategy? I hope we get through this with our country and its constitution intact.	0

"Yes, I can kill people with my bare hands; however, that is a slow and strenuous process and I can't kill very many people that way. On the other extreme end of the spectrum, I can kill millions of people in a few seconds by detonating a hydrogen bomb in the air over a large city. A modern gun, that can shoot quickly and be reloaded quickly, makes it possible for a person who doesn't have the strength to kill with bare hands or muscle powered weapons to kill quite a few people quite quickly. Somewhere on the spectrum from rock to hydrogen bomb, there comes a point where you have to say ""this weapon is just too powerful to be generally available""."	1

Similarly, after years of deadly mismanagement of ODOT by Matt Garrett, I cannot support any additional funds for ODOT. It's an absolute disaster of a state department.

Actually, in nearly all the major religious traditions of Our Lord's time, women priests were the norm, not the exception. Ancient Greece had priestesses that presided at festivals and in the temples of most goddesses and some god; so too ancient Rome and Egypt. Including females in the priesthood would have been an avenue to make evangelization more palatable to the gentiles. In addition, Sacred Scripture is replete with instances in which Our Lord intentionally violated both social and religious norms, and is equally replete with instances in which Our Lord associated with women who were outside His family and friendship circles. Yet, the fact that the Scriptures are clear that women were not present during the Last Supper, at which the priesthood was instituted, and that no women were chosen as Apostles, seems to indicate that Our Lord intentionally chose men only to serve as His priests. It seems abundantly clear that Our Lord willed His Church to have an all-male priesthood.	0
I agree Judith.....though I do believe it would be nicer to have mixed cemeteries as that would do a nicer job showing we are all one under god. So if there were Christian cemeteries that refused to bury Muslims I would be appalled. But I am not always comfortable with cultures coming here and thinking they should have separate schools, cemeteries etc.....Not sure if that is the issue here and my regrets to these folks. However, let's not forget the issue swings both ways. Do they require to be buried separately and if so, then I would begin to disagree...same as if Christians refused them burial space.	0
Yes the US was the prime lender but once Wall Street crashed a wave of protectionism swept the globe as government after sought to apply 19th century solutions to their economies.

Many of the bloggers on the ADN are from out of Alaska, some are part of the Soro's digital army to discredit Mr. Trump. The partnership between the mainstream media, the Soro's paid bloggers and agitators, and the Clinton Cartel crime syndicate creates the perception that Mr Trump is losing. Most Americans are smart enough to realize that Clinton is dishonest. Recent email releases show the crimes. Trump will do well. I find this Washington Post article very offensive and insulting to all Trump supporters as it indicates that Trump supporters are violent and dangerous. The article denies that the election is rigged. Why then is Jeh Johnson Homeland Security complaining that not enough states are asking Homeland for help for the elections while he stesses how at risk the elections are??

Can't wait until the professional athlete and those taking a knee in a sign of solidarity of police brutally and social justice protest the cultural genocide of black abortions. Cause the targeting of pregnant black Americans by Planned Parenthood is obviously racist. Black abortions are five times higher than white abortions. By design? So it's much more lethal to the overall number of African Americans...than cops. Abortion doctors in the line of duty remove 2,500 potential African Americans for every one Black person killed by a cop in the line of duty. So yeah, let's see all the support for a true black lives matter protest when a truly brave professional athlete and those like Pat Flynn take a knee to bring social justice attention to the abortion culture that targets the black community above all others.	0

It is an irrational argument to think that there is no bias when 3% of available funds are invested in woman led start ups. Woman make up 50% of our population, there are documented examples of sexual harassment in the venture capital industry, an industry which is dominated by men. To say that there are not enough woman led start up applications or that there are too many inexperienced woman founders only reinforces the existing bias. Step back. Consider the numbers in aggregate and then evaluate ways to address those stats and significantly increase start up investments in woman led ventures. The startup community will be better for it.	0

It is a crime to criticize, doubt, or disagree with Islam in Islamic states. This is blasphemy and the sentence is death. It is a crime and a sin to leave Islam. A Muslim who rejects Islam is an “apostate” and the punishment for apostasy is death (and eternal damnation in hell thereafter). Under sharia, it is forbidden for anyone to try to convert a Muslim to another religion. When Islam is doubted or defamed in any way, Muslims should violently defend it. Muslims consider all non-Muslims and non-Muslim culture useless and see their goal to make the whole world Muslim. Everything before Islam is jahiliyya or ignorance, of no value and should be destroyed. Under Islam, non-Muslims must pay a large tax. Once Muslims conquer a country and convert the government to Islamic law, non-Muslims have the choice to convert or die. However, Christians, Jews, and some Zoroastrians have the choice between becoming Muslim or becoming a dhimmi. Read Bat Ye'or's publication Eurabia.	1

another story in todays paper about a 44 yr old woman busted for dealing meth within a 1000 yards of a school.

Student demand is a creative label. Present a bunch of options to free-spending spoiled juveniles armed with somebody else's checkbook (daddy's or Uncle Sams), and those kids will select every item on the menu, every time, and borrow up to their eyeballs to do it. I don't care how glitzy the dorms are, there's better educational options available out of state. Cry me a river about eroding state support. Colorado higher education has mismanaged what it's been given, to create further bureaucracy and non-core spending programs. They've built themselves a Club-Med environment focused on entitlements, militancy, and marijuana edibles. My kids are headed out of state, to get a solid (career-focused) education at a better value, to boot. Over and out.	0

Game out what will happen if Trump backs out of the Iran agreement. The rest of the world will not go along. Iran will be free to resume its nuclear program because the rest of the world will not reimpose sanctions. A win-win for Iran, a lose-lose for Trump and the United States. It will be the dumbest foreign policy move vis-à-vis Iran, since Bush invaded Iraq.	1

The other part of how the Australian model won't work here, is the rabid gun folks. I'm not talking the run of the mill hunters or target shooters, but the guys who scream that the 2nd Amendment is about keeping the government in check. Those folks honestly believe they can fight the government with their ARs. Many of them are couch commandos, but many of them would actually try to fight it out if the 2nd Amendment was repealed. Personally I don't want to see anything as drastic as the Australian model here, but I do think that we need to find a solution. That solution isn't just more guns, I'm not sure what it looks like, but more guns isn't' the answer.	0

I am including Vice President Pence in the group.

I'm 6-2 and I think this is a made-up issue 1/ A lot of travel is business 2/ Business travelers sleep, not because they are lazy but because they are on tight time-lines and it is the best they can manage 3/ That few degrees reline allows your head to JUST go back far enough to sleep. It is a HUGE difference. 4/ This is a 'personal space' issue. Look at the pivot point, at knee level it only moves a little ways. 99% of people are not tall enough for this to hit them. They don't have shin room but that has nothing to do with reclining. I don't know who made up this b.s. etiquette argument. It is fiction. Travelling weekly every business traveler I see reclines. [survey a red-eye and I bet you'll see +80% reclining] Business travelers don't complain about the person in front of them. They don't complain about a lot of things, taking off shoes in security, liquids, carry-on baggage restrictions, even kids screaming - it is just part of flying. Flying sucks. They know the ropes.	1

But these attacks certainly do highlight the importance of being armed and able to defend yourself. Run and hide and wait for 8 minutes and/ or hold your dying loved one in your arms as she passes away. That, I kid you not, is the progressive version of self protection. In Canada, this is the one section of the charter the progressive left detests, your right to section 7, life, liberty and security of the person. That right must be provided for you, you aren't to exercise that right of your own volition. Creating a nation of victims will ensure Canada gets victimized.	0

Localstateofmind, allow me to address your points: 1) Native Hawaiian cosmogonic genealogies trace back millennia. Archaeological finds evidence first human settlement over 1,200 years ago (couple sources: DLNR, and Dr. Patrick Kirch). Anthropologists and archaeologist would suggest that the finite amount of livable space in these islands and constant development could have had a detrimental impact on the preservation of archaeological remains dating further back. Ancient human settlement was primarily near the coast - the coastline has significantly changed. 2) No. Many chiefs, of the time before, sought the unification of the Hawaiian Islands. Before Kamehameha I there was Kahekili, before him, many others. Native Hawaiians exercised sovereignty/authority over the Hawaiian Islands, when Kamehameha I conquered them. When the U.S. illegally annexed the Hawaiian Islands following its support of a white-led revolution - Native Hawaiians no longer exercised authority.	0

So if you felt you were overpaid, why didn't you quit and go to work in the private sector that you so revere? There are lots of garbage collector jobs in private industry. Of course then you would have had to give up your cushy Public Employees Retirement System pension, which we the taxpayers have to fund. The contributions you paid in don't come anywhere near covering the costs. Every year the Muni has to kick in additional money. That comes from the taxpayers pockets. I bring this up everytime, not because I'm jealous (I probably have a higher net worth than you), but to point out what a hypocrite you are. You've always talked the talk, but have never walked the walk.	1

Issues at the periphery. How is Canada changing in some fundamental way as a result of there being a Liberal government? Not in any way that I can see. Why? Because the two parties don't have fundamental differences. Changing the electoral system from FPTP to PR would have amounted to a fundamental change, and a positive one at that. But, like the Conservatives, the Liberals don't want to change a system that unfairly distorts results in their favour. It's just something the Liberals said to get elected.	0
What biased nonsense. 'advertising budget cut' what? The ONLY people who are screaming the loudest are those who don't pay, are subsidized. The real damaged ones are those that do. This entire matter should never have gone 'total', it was always about those who can't pay, they should have put them on Medicaid and gotten it over with.	0
Thank you for agreeing with me. That it changes incrementally is in large part a function of the fact we aren't trying very hard to change things, rather than some inherent barrier that can't be surmounted. Not even impossible with today's technology (and that is an artificial constraint you've assumed, it is not assumed at all in my claim). There are solutions to everything you see as a barrier. Example, solar thermal doesn't require battery storage. Some very rich entrepreneurs are making huge bets against your viewpoint.	0

Requirement to disclose discipline records of police involved in case- sidelines officers who had any issues whatever.

Liberal ethical hypocrisy yet again... Being corrupt last time and on the edge of political oblivion obviously didn't teach them the lesson. Look at Wynne and now Morneau. Bitch and moan about unethical policies that Harper and his ilk the Conservatives practiced and now do EXACTLY the same thing.

"People are forgetting that asking, or even trying to get a female to go along with the ""intentions"" is not against the law. Actually doing something against someone's will is against the law. So, given that some women are shrieking about women's rights, equality, being as good as a man, then why have I not read anywhere where a woman simply said ""NO"" and left? Women have to take their share of the responsibility in this. Going to someone's hotel room or whatever does not sound like a regular ""business"" meeting to me or anyone else. Women shouldn't put themselves in situations where they might regret the outcome! Were they forced to go? I, again, haven't heard that Weinstein or anyone else held a gun to their heads or other. If a career in Hollywood is that important to someone then I guess he/she has to be willing to live in that culture."	0

Loren: Its laughable that a defense attorney would feign offense at lies, when vigorous defense often means pointing the finger at everyone except your client, spinning a vast web of often mutually exclusive fabrications until the jury is so shellshocked they reasonably doubt their own names.

I went to school in the early 80s and the kids who couldn't hack the real sciences (wanted to be doctors) moved to psychology. I agree with your second paragraph. If a country has an issue, it should address it. I'm not against alternative energy, I just think it should be a business initiative not a global mandate put forth by government based on political objectives. Giant multi-government powerful agreements are dangerous. I trust no government unconditionally, including the US, and believe that smaller governments are safer, subject to the power of an armed citizenry. A one-world government spread across the world would become tyrannical. The US has some of the cleanest air in the world and some of the richest fossil fuel reserves. It would be economically stupid to discard that because the rest of the world dislikes the competition and is unable to manage its development.	0

This shows how ignorant you are , just as the liberal media is, referring to assault rifles. A hunting rifle equipped with a bump stock, is just as dangerous as your so called assault weapon.

Communism is a dead idea Since you are either young or incredibly ill-educated, communism destroys economies not the other way around. Personal ideas, drive, hard work, has historically been the driver of growth, innovation, wealth, prosperity, etc. Government sucks the life out of an economy. Go watch a movie on Soviet Union 30 years ago. Drab horrible jobs where you pasted glue on bolt for a monthly wage... That is not progress, that is slavery. Since you clearly do not understand what communism has destroyed in the past - I would suggest you talk to someone who has lived through it. Oh and did I mention oligarchs, apparatchiks, party members who lived like gods while the billions like animals or worse starved.... Grow up and investigate your ideas.

"I think it's pretty clear that the Comey firing is the moment that the US slides into authoritarianism. The Republicans in Congress have put party ahead of country for decades -they will do nothing to stop Trump. The Trump supporters are ""low information voters"" who are simply abysmally ignorant -they are the exact danger that every democracy always faces -i.e., to survive as a democracy, a state needs intelligent and informed voters, a group that is seriously underrepresented in the US. Between these two, Trump has been given a free pass. Trump himself is very much like his supporters - a know-nothing who has become President and has no idea what he is doing. For the next two years, at least, he will run his country into the ground and undermine all its established norms and values."	1

"It seems the strategy is to bring hard issues to the fore front and have everyone make a stand. You have a mad dictator firing missiles over adjacent countries with verbal threats to use his new found nuclear power as a pastime. Nobody wants to confront the issue. Ok, so far we have China solidly in the red corner, Russia tagging along, Germany wants no part of this, in the blue corner we have Australia, Japan, SKorea, and maybe the UK. Good to know who your true allies are. If a missile hits Guam, Kim is toast. The DPRK plan is to land missiles near Guam and not on Guam which is more of the same ""Sanction me more and just wait till I get my real stuff going"" statement. As the main player in the United Nations and ""Protector"" of lesser nations......What do you do?? This NOT just a Trump vs Kim issue. The world should be engaged and involved. If we do nothing the United Nations as a watchdog is absolutely useless. These are not just 9mm bullets flying over your heads."	1

"There is something wrong with the narrative on this. If it is truly as barbaric and causes unremitting lifelong pain, why would veterinarians do it? The position of the AVMA is educate patients and push alternatives, but not ""don't do it"". Why would there be so many cats who, having undergone the procedure, live 10-15 years as happy and affectionate pets? Yeah, I get that cats can hide pain. But not long term. I've had them all my life until a month ago. If it were as terrible as some opponents say, it seems that euthanasia would be recommended if the only way to keep the cat is declawing. But it is considered to be preferable to euthanising a problem cat who won't stop scratching inappropriately. I have to wonder if there are some vets that do it better than others? Studies apparently do not support a connection between declawing and bad behavior. I think there is a lot of misinformation in the arguments."	0

"Hard question. Globally, ""contemporary conservatives"" are sometimes economic nationalists who face off against neoliberal globalists. Sometimes they are just people who resist the transformation of all value into market value--they want to preserve ethical and religious traditions. Sometimes they are anti-immigration; sometimes not. They seem to be a number of different things. One of the few international leaders who makes political and intellectual sense to me (in the sense of being comprehensible) is Angela Merkel--a Christian Democrat, which is, in a way, a kind of conservative liberal. In this country, it is even more confusing. The anti-conservative DT has the overwhelming support of conservatives. How is that to be explained?"	0

This entire assault ordeal reeks of a spoiled, privileged celebrity accusing a man who did not do this at all of misconduct.

With due sympathies to the anxious renters in question, you may do better to face a reality that seems to escape you. You seem to be under the mistaken impression that Vancouver is meaningfully a city in Canada and therefore you have the right to expect that Canadian traditions and Canadian sensibilities reign the day. Sorry to burst your bubble, but no, Vancouver is NOT meaningfully a city in Canada and so no, you do not have the right to expect that Canadian traditions and sensibilities will reign the day. See, thing is, the Canadian cultural tradition, for centuries, has been that local workers can buy a house for their family and go back and forth to work at a local job in any Canadian city. But in recent decades, Canada SOLD that tradition to the highest bidders with overseas money. So that cultural tradition is now dead and thus Vancouver is the first city to DETACH from that cultural fabric of Canada. You clamor for ways and associated blessings that no longer exist.	0

Trump says one thing, the U.S. ambassador to the UN says another, the secretary of state says something else entirely. Some are calling it the ‘good cop, bad cop’ routine. Looks more like the Keystone Cops. Those who seek comfort in the fact that the U.S. has the firepower to wipe North Korea off the map need to review their geography. Seoul is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the world — home to 25.6 million people. And it's just 35 miles from North Korea. Then there’s Tokyo. It has 37.8 million people in its greater metropolitan area. North Korea has shown in missile tests that the Japanese capital is within range. And how would China respond to a US nuclear strike, or even a conventional one, on its borders — given that it would trigger a vast refugee inflow from North Korea into China?	0

Olson in splendid self-serving delusion. There are always lingering 'issues' on complicated trade agreements. But did Canada demand the U.S. re-negotiate? NO!! Do you think they will if we asked? NO!! Trump blames NAFTA as part of his election win strategy. Never mind the facts behind it. It's Trump who demands re-negotiations. ON HIS TERMS. Mexico and Canada are stupid indeed if we think we can get some of our issues addressed from Trump. Trump will get HIS issues addressed or he will walk. The ONLY way we can get our hot issues addressed is to wait for Trump to walk out of NAFTA. Then start negotiations on a brand new agreement. That is, IF, people of both side permit. Canada does not need outsiders on our matters.	1

The Clown is Bannon if he expects us to believe that the formaer head of the alt-right press isn't somewhat aligned with the fascists at Charlottesville.

This is a bit of a joke. Retailers in Canada have been an oligopoly for over 25 years. Their objectives are to screw both ends of the supply chain, both suppliers and the consumer. They have done so brilliantly, bilking suppliers of untold billions of dollars to pad their bottom lines severely limiting any real price competition, thus grossly overcharging consumers. If anyone thinks that our useless competition law is going to change the status quo, they are sorely deluded.	1

Chin must think we are stupid.

Chin seems not to understand that his mother-in-law is the mother of his wife who is a legal US resident. Thus, his mother-in-law would be allowed to enter the US not based on being his in-law but based on being the mother of a legal US resident or citizen.	1

You don't understand Russia. They can't be compared with SA or Iran. Russia has vast resources at their hand and they can survive the isolation, their GDP drop is just in face value, doesn't have deep impact on living standard. On the other hand, Russian can play a big destabilizing role at small cost, something west still can't find way to cope with. It is quite different from Soviet time, to establish an empire, now they only need to ruin your life, which doesn't cost much.	0

You realize how silly your question is, right? How can there possibly be multiple organizations representing fundamentalist religious views? How can there be 634 First Nations in Canada? You appear to expect that members of the LGBTQ community all belong to some sort of common organization or union of sorts. Maybe it's good for those who oppose their interests that they don't as such an organization would likely represent hundreds of thousands of Canadians. My guess is that the LGBTQ community may well exceed in size the population of Christian fundamentalists in Canada.	1
Well, some of us do know how the criminal justice system works and called bs on the charge. It doesn't take a legal scholar to know that shooting someone in anger and within the context of the intentional infliction of chaos was trying to kill someone.

How many of you follow the 10 Commandments? My thought is that whoever follows the 10 Commandments is following teachings in the Bible. If you are not a believer in God, then why do you follow the commandments. For me it seems reasonable to believe that you really do believe in God. Also, how many of you believe in the Golden Rule? If you do not believe in God, then why do you believe in the Golden Rule? How can you say God doesn't exist if you believe in His teachings? I am thinking, as it's said in AA, to select a God of your understanding. The Golden Rule 12 “Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law & the prophets. Matthew 7:12 The story is about invocation & meetings. I don't believe that taking time to pray to anything as a group is essential or effective for a business meeting. I believe that a moment of silence is reasonable & sufficient. Also, you can invoke all to be sane during a meeting without God.	0

Hawaii's parks are pathetic! Part of the problem is because they do not generate revenue, they are ignored. Part of the problem is the way funds are spent. Ever watch City employees doing maintenance or grounds keeping in parks? Private employees would do the same work in less than half the time. But city workers know they will get their raise next year no matter what, so why work hard. Many parks close at 10PM, but the homeless still stay. Where is the enforcement? As I said Hawaii's parks are pathetic. This is Hawaii, so where are the flowers in our parks? While my daughter was attending college in Colorado she was employed by the City's Parks Department. In the spring they planted flowers in the parks and even on medial strips on the roadways. In fall they dug up these flowers to keep in a safe place in the winter then replanted in the spring. Hawaii doesn't have to keep flowers in a warm place in winter, they just need to plant them. Nothing will be done as no outcry!	1

Australia restricts foreign buyers to new builds. This has had some success, but major cities also suffer from sold and empty units, I believe over 60,000 in Melbourne alone. I like your idea of purpose built rentals only, it is a step in the right direction. Too back the federal Liberals have no intention of doing anything, so this would depend on the province to say, up the foreign buyers purchase tax, and waive it for rental buildings. I don't think this is anywhere on their radar without extensive lobbying from metro Vancouver, and Island Mayors.	0

"Many of the comments always seem to end up referring to the inadequacy of the “the government’s” response to the problem.. that it is “the government’s job” to solve the homelessness problem and the attendant issues related to affordable housing, substance abuse and the mental and physical illnesses of those who cannot afford a place to live. At the same time these editorial opinions have ignored the culpability of the private sector in helping create and exacerbate the lack of affordable housing in Hawaii (and other places), and allow homelessness over these past 40 years to become a “crisis”, while building more and more ""unaffordable housing"", including luxury condos for the world’s rich."	0

Agree with you that people living there should be mandated to have flood insurance. One poster on the DP boards is from Florida and said they're still dropping mobile homes in those areas. The requirement is to safety strap them down. But, they still fly apart when the hurricanes come. Stupid.

That was a classic.	1

"No, Trump didn't ""have to happen,"" but he was inevitable from a historical viewpoint. Regardless of repeatedly bad outcomes, the conservative base always votes against it's own interests, typically electing the greediest, most money-hungry, self-centered conservative representatives who present themselves as ""regular guy"" populists but who are in reality the worst elitests socially, financially, religiously & in every area from which profit can be made.They worship the almighty dollar above all else, but have succeeded in bamboozling their base into thinking they care about them. Thus their base supports laws, regs & policies that harm them but enrich the conservative elite. This phenomenon has long mystified many observers. Books like ""What's The Matter With Kansas?"" reflect this puzzlement. Libs have repeatedly pointed out this con to the right wing base & have been soundly ignored. That's why the whole ""we've been ignored and now we're mad"" whine from Trumpnuts rings so falsely."	1

"Condo board fraud is the ultimate penalty free enterprise and, like in Florida now, anything less than total transparency with audits and prison time for transgressions would be highly ineffectual.

What's different is that the 2008 ballot measure was for a charter amendment when no language pertaining to taxicabs had existed in the charter before. Plus, the alternatives others have been harping about didn't exist in 2008. Plus, the Assembly is very good at manipulating the process when initiatives are proposed by actual citizens and not political groups. That initiative was proposed in 2002, if I remember correctly, and stalled by the system to the point where few cared once 2008 rolled around. My problem was the manner in which taxicabs were dispatched had long been antiquated, favoring neither the driver (in terms of paid miles) or the customer (in terms of serving certain locations). I once called a cab from Muldoon Fred Meyer when I missed the bus, to go down DeBarr to Costco.

I think military service has way more to do with the rush of testosterone and dominance then figuring out reasonable resolution. You make the choices you do about the job you take. I believe all military benefits should end at end of service. There's way, way, too much focus on military in this country-no where near enough focus on resolving difficulties outside of a ""our side wins"" mentality.

Possible but highly unlikely. It's true that the swastika has been around for a long time -- even Rudyard Kipling had it on the flyleaf of his first editions; this was before the mustachioed dictator, of course. But most of the miscreants that adorn themselves in Nazi themed regalia do it solely for shock value. Almost to a man, they have little to no knowledge of history or culture.

"I'm sorry, but Lisa is being a fool with this vote. The downside to this vote is much greater than any upside, especially considering she was just re-elected and will be for the rest of her life. After the HUGE show of support Trump has given her, including sitting her next to him at lunches, having Zinke make an extended 6 day trip to Alaska, etc, THIS is how she repays him??? An ungrateful wench is what I now call her. This legislation is the biggest effort in this Administration, and sometimes you just have to ""take one for the team"". She needs to start with firing ALL of her staff, who are a bunch of twenty-something Dems, get her office straightened out and get with the program."	1

Funny isn't it. The more rational Liberals are showing their real fears. What kind of monster are they about to create? Medical experts have warned them yet they obsessively drive head on at high speed into a massive destructive wall thanks to the will of their stupid leader. Everyone knows there's far more reasons to discourage Canada's use of pot than there are to encourage an even greater use of the drug - except for him. So go ahead, try and create a real tough law to feel better about yourselves. Will you stop pot and alcohol from being used together? Absolutely not. Your own leader openly admitted doing so illegally with friends after dinner when he was an MP. We also know that lots of people will drive on both drugs as a two-drug cocktail lowers judgement even more. With kids and pot, guess what? Your new law will put so much pot out there it'll be far easier for all kinds of young children to have their brains permanently modified by the drug by the time one's 20 yrs. old.	1
Well, there is an up side and a down side to this. With more Fentanyl on the streets and in the heroin the druggies are willfully injecting into their veins, the chances of overdose go up, the chances of permanent and unfixable damage go up, the chances of death go up. That's the *down side, to those who still care about them. On the up side, less druggies mean safer streets, less theft, less shoplifting, less burglaries, less drain on the 'incredibly scarce resources we have' (as the politicians always trumpet from their Golden Thrones), less amounts of all kinds of abuse, including to the children of the aforementioned junkies. Having lost thousands of dollars, countless hours of time, several homes, a vehicle, and personal possessions to strung-out junkies that were once family, the sympathy tank is pretty much dry. The sad part is that the Dealers aren't shooting the same poison into their veins, which would be Justice, indeed.	0

If this is some kind of excuse for what this sadistic woman did to her daughter, the horrific systematical torture that ended her young life, it falls short. McAnulty was not abused to the point of death, nor were her siblings. There is no comparison. I've been a staunch advocate against the death penalty for many decades. I've stood up in protest for child killers, rapists who've killed, and people who've murdered multiple individuals, all who were sentenced to death, but I wouldn't protest the execution of this woman. God forgive me, but it's how I feel. To take a life in an instant entails very little time for one's humanity to be struck with mercy. To torture and relentlessly inflict unspeakable pain over years is different. Her only motive was to inflict unbearable suffering and a slow merciless death on her own child. I feel McAnulty is completely void of humanity, she's an empty vessel of evil, beyond redemption. I wouldn't fight to save that.	1

McArdle's position is well-argued. But the most it leaves us with is the choice between rope and rack. That a Trump victory is constitutionally legitimate doesn't mean it won't be ruinous. It will; ruinous not only to our global and domestic economic interests, not only to both the local and global environments, but to our political culture, which has heretofore required that a president have experience in public service and that s/he take certain steps to prove that s/he has no conflict between personal interests and public duty. Not only are these things not true of Trump, but he has demonstrated over and over that he is impulsive, inconsistent, and cares little about the truth. He believes he already understands all issues without need for study, informed advice, or--and this is especially important--having his preconceptions challenged. He is surrounding himself with equally inexperienced sycophants with their own agendas, principally to abolish what others have built.	0

Don't get me wrong I am truly no liberal democrat and am wary of how much control the ""institutional"" elites have over the government but time and time again I see this administration teeter and topple without direction. Trump challenged the very institutions and cornerstones of what made America great like some schoolyard bully, rather than argue with logic, facts and figures: feuding with the press, military, judges, and intelligence community; name calling allies, and the pope and behaving like a jackass.

The article misses the actual point of WHAT and WHY. In Colorado a cake decorator or artist can refuse to create any design or image they do not agree with, provided they have not made that design before. In this case the couple asked for a undecorated- cake and were refused. Colorado sided with the couple because a plain cake is part of a standard commercial transaction and not an artistic expression similar to creating an image. The bakers, photographers & florists are arguing that they are in fact artists creating a unique expression & the act of baking a cake (flower arrangements etc..) is in fact artistic expression and is protected vs. The current standard that identifies these activities as standard commercial transactions. It's a interesting argument	0

When I was living in Anchorage and active in municipal politics during the 1990s, it was understood by those affected that the transportation inspector's office was supposed to operate on a self-support basis. One year, this was called into question when it became known that the TI office racked up over $60,000 in interagency charges to the municipal attorney's office to enforce the collection of less than $5,000 in fines. Unless there was revenue involved, they were expecting the taxi companies to police themselves. Then they started targeting people who were bringing these issues to public attention. The TI at the time, Col. Llewellyn, was telling people that he had a background in military intelligence (which was false) and this is why Mystrom hired him, to spy on the taxi business and clean it up or some such nonsense. Then he wanted to extend this same sort of regulation to ice cream trucks. With that track record, perhaps some of us fail to see any regulation as a good thing.	0

"Why not coal? Cost per KWH is 8.5 cents vs. the 22.1 cents under this contract. Use the land to grow food. Otherwise, the competitive use of the land will be based on an artificially created value by the sale of biofuel products. Just as the legislative mandate to put alcohol in gasoline prompted the exponential jump in the price of corn, the unanticipated consequences of higher food costs for raising farm animals such as pigs and cows caused the skyrocketing of meat prices. Additionally, the high cost of corn products used in Mexico cause even more illegal immigration as earning enough money to feed a family became only possible by getting better paying jobs in the US. The editors of this newspaper are total idiots if they don't understand that all their ""great causes"" result in the exponential rise in the cost of living in Hawaii."	1

"1/2 Re Horror Stories: Seriously, Jay, these are not horror stories, but weekly occurrences. My [unstated] point is that no traditionally received method of distribution of the Eucharist is without difficulties when examined from the modern perspective of hygiene. Intinction has a lot going for it, until you practice it on a mass scale, and discover communicants dipping their fingers into the wine, sometimes because the Eucharistic Minister has not lowered the chalice enough for the recipient to see what they are doing. Sipping from the common cup is regularly, IMHO, rendered unhygienic because purificators have been starched so you can't wipe the chalice properly both inside and outside, and the chalice is not turned. Distribution really needs to be studied, and new methods developed; and we much not be shy about learning from Protestants, many of whom use individual small glasses. Re ""fistula"": I do not know what you are referring to? Straw? Ladle? Misspelling? Elaboration please?"	0

Wynne and Ben Levin's education curriculum in Ontario is designed to steer kids to useless majors like gender studies, and sociology, which is a ticket for activists to get cushy government jobs at taxpayer expense. This is why they hate science and encourage young girls especially to drop out and go into the humanities. Since they can't coherently argue using scientific fact they'll cite some useless profess or unreviewed piece of junk opinion pieces. Most teachers can barely add and subtract either so the kids get politics rammed down their throats as well as incompetent STEM teachers.	1

Trump is playing right into Russia's hands. Russia has always been trying to drive a wedge between the US and its allies ever since the end of WW2. Russia sees this as essential to curtailing US influence around the world in order to increase Russia's sphere of influence. Unfortunately for the US, they might have elected a manchurian candidate in Trump. Either he is incompetent and easily manipulated by fake news or Russia has some damaging evidence being used to sway Trump into the Russian fold.	1

Was he signalling to the world that this is how Canada must forevermore be viewed by all peoples everywhere; as an abuser of the indigenous? Was he saying Canada and Canadians should be pilloried, should be shamed, globally, for this our eternal, original sin. What an embarrassment.	1

No. We do not need a Portland office to perform tasks the DEQ is funded to perform but doesn't. That's just like funding the CASA program because DHS is supposed to take care of foster kids and doesn't.

Creating individual city level DEQs is duplicative and wasteful, and seems to assume the state DEQ can never be counted on to perform as expected. Really? This makes no sense, but if it's going to happen the Portland office needs to be subsidized by the state DEQ office not local taxes.	0

Just a lot of grandstanding by want-a-be Presidents on both sides of the fence. US banks could very well have some WF type problem accounts. And then there is the issue that the banks have been using their HFT subs to manipulate all commodity prices ( including oil) to keep same down thereby ensuring greater consumption of goods in USA at cheap prices and simultaneously draining Russia financially. That would likely require some questionable agreements between Obama and the US banks. Interesting that oil price dropped over last two weeks by $8/bbl. Interesting because the same EIA database that showed the 8 mmbbls increase in crude oil inventory, showed an 19 mmbbls decline in petroleum product inventory during the same two week period. Not a peep from any of the bank owned media or the stock market academics. The price should have gone up $8/bbl but went down solely because of this half truth published by the media and the gullible masses ongoing belief in the media's truthfulness.	0

Depends on your definition of racist. I know a number of Trump voters who don't consider themselves racist in terms of putting down non whites.

"I had a public sector bureaucrat at my house this party this weekend.

He laughed. The 7 business people around the room said : He's not joking"" The guy quickly realized he had come to the wrong party and left. The point is most middle class careers for most people are in the public sector now. For 50-80 years public sector jobs paid less because of the benefits they received. Due to exploding public costs the private sector is wasteland. High taxes, operating costs are shutting private businesses down. Those of you in the public sector snicker. But here's the catch you are doomed because tax revenue is gone..... In less than 5 years we predict 40% of you will be gone We moved our businesses to the US or online. This is your Canada"	1

You were wrong before and you don't have that good of a track record in this election. Why listen to you? Just a thought, but here is what the electors should do. The electors should cast their votes based off the majority vote of the states they represent. That is their job. Their job isn't to bail out the loudest whining group in the country. The thought that Trump will destroy America is countered by the other sides' thoughts that Hillary would do the same. End of the day, you lost! Now shut it!	1

I have asked them for the link of this latest poll like they provided for the one done in October 2015. So far they have not provided a link to it. Mr. Lindsey has the fiduciary duty to do what is in his principals best interest and he is. As for Na'i Aupuni, I have consistently and persistently opposed it even signing my name to the petition at the 'aha at Hale A'o which you hosted. However censorship is the deal breaker for me.

The deep state is the problem and it's inflicting Progressive disease on society. Ontario is the prime example. The government is only focused on increasing taxes to feed the deep state, services are cut, and the remaining services are expensive. Sadly, the only solution seems to be bankruptcy.

They continue to feed the machine and things get worse. Like Trump or not, at least he has a clue as to how to get the focus back on taxpayers but he needs to fight against the state, the press and the likes of George Soros. Let's hope he is successful.	0

So what has the Gasping Old Party learned since its 'autopsy' of 2012 (and 2008) - they continue to alienate women, Blacks, Latinos, Asians and other minorities, Millennials, LGBTs, non-saber rattlers, people who care for our planet. No Republican can win the presidency with a constituency of old, angry, Bible thumping white folks. The votes simply are not there in today's tumble of real world diversity - one they refuse to acknowledge and embrace. As for Lisa, she is increasingly speaking to Alaskans with a forked tongue while appeasing the GOP and her campaign contributors. Disappointing.	1

When Brian Mulroney was prime minister, he REMOVED controls & limits on land ownership by foreign individuals & entities in order to promote 'free trade'. How 'free' does that feel right now? In a world of 8-billion people, why are Canadian realtors promising to advertise new listings in 100 countries and 40 languages? While many in China have low incomes, the massive no. of humans in that 1.4-billion population means there are millionaires & billionaires who find Canada's land & housing cheap. Similarly, there are wealthy people in Russia, Gulf States, India and other nations. Add ALL those wealthy foreign 'interests' together, and we find Canadians losing jobs to out-sourcing & automation, while competing with foreign nationals for homes. Canada cannot house the entire world! Time to put Canadians first. 'Free Trade' has been anything BUT free for Canadian citizens. Time to save Canadians, but politicians listen to 'outside interests' who pay ZERO income tax. Value OUR land!	0
The U.S.A. is in its worst political crisis since the Vietnam War. We live next door to the Americans. Without Canada and its trade for the last 150 years, the USA's economy would be a fraction of what it is. Canada is the U.S.A.'s best friend - whether you like it or not. A neighbor is allowed to say what he thinks about a crisis going on next door. I have never seen Americans divided so meanly. It runs from their far right to their far left - which are further apart than ever before. Trump's victory has brought that all to the fore. The sooner he goes, the better for the U.S.A. - including Republicans seeking re-election in mid-terms next year.	0

If the Russians tried to influence the US elections, they were pretty inept. Hillary Clinton and her supporters did far more damage to her campaign than any alien could have done. Plus Hillary, the preferred successor of the feckless Obama, would have provided continuing mirth as the Russians continued to defy her and figuratively spit in her face like they did to Obama. Putin isn't happy with Trump blasting his client Assad's forces and essentially setting up an autonomous Kurd region in Syria.	1

Sure. Trump himself has provided ample evidence. 1) Violations of the emoluments clause. Trump himself decided to ignore the trouble here, not divest his assets. Even Jimmy Carter sold his peanut farm. 2) Impairment and obstruction of inquiries by the Justice Department and Congress into the extent of the Trump administration’s conflicts of interests and Russia ties. The firing of Comey & Yates would probably have been ok if not for his own tweets basically admitting to obstruction of justice and discounting the official narrative that it was a performance-based decision. Truly, the chances of a Trump impeachment would be close to nil if not for his own fumbling and stupidity.	1

"The issue is what to do with the old condo developments prior to the regulatory sprinkler requirement.

So, in the ""public spirit"" of Rail, pass a law requiring every old condo building to install sprinklers. Better yet -- because all of O'ahu and soon, the entire State, will pay for Ewa's Rail, in the ""Spirit of Rail,"" require that every other condo highrise on O'ahu also chip in to pay for sprinklers in the older buildings.

The west should never ever listen or believe what Putin and or anybody from Russia tells them. It's always 100% BS. Until Putin is out of power then we can talk and have a relationship with Russia.

But he was right. We pulled out and within 18 months ISIS was taking the place over. Shoot I remember thinking give it 5 years, and it happened even faster than I guessed it would. It didn't matter if we thought it was right or wrong for going into Iraq. Didn't matter. But once we were there we should have seen it through--by that ensuring we have a strong, U.S. friendly government in place there, and even then withdraw only very slowly, over decades if needed. But we seem incapable of seeing anything through for longer than the term of a president."	0

The setting of war is not even close to the same analogy as the comfort and protection we/you expect to have in our communities. The rules of engagement vastly differ... We rely on law enforcement to assist us in providing a safe environment to live, work, play and raise a family. Yes, losing a loved one you know that went to go fight and die in a war is painful, but the military's main focus is to maintain readiness for wartime. A law enforcement officer's job is to uphold the law and attempt to maintain law and order with the minimal force necessary to gain compliance. What's tragic is some folks like to push the envelop and when that happens, usually someone get hurt and/or killed. Unfortunately sometimes that is our police officers/troopers. This is why we must ensure this legislation passes... cops are the line in the sand against criminals and the first entity we call when the crap hits the fan at home and in our communities. Not many have the courage to do what they do.	1

REAL emotion has dried up (edocrine hypofunction) after years of over-reliance on daycare, over indulgence in facebook, unflinching pharmaceutical responses to ADHD-ADD-Autism over-diagnoses, and a vacuous vapid entertainment/media industry, so therefore FAKE emotion goes a loooong way with your modern cosmopolitan society.

Casualty of war unfortunately. It does not mean it would not have been nice to not have them die, but when the enemy hides among them it will continue to happen.

"Re: Charleston shooter's ""criminal record"" No, the 72-hour limit had nothing to do with his getting a gun. Federal law (18 USC 922(g) and (d)) applies to those convicted of, or under indictment for, a crime punishable by more than one year in prison. The Charleston shooter was charged with (not yet convicted of) the crime of possession of a controlled substance. Under South Carolina law, that's a misdemeanor. The case documents refer to ""charge code 0179"" - maximum of 6 months in jail. The only question is whether a single charge (without conviction) means he's an ""unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled substance"". The federal definition of that term (27 CFR 478.11) says an inference may be drawn from multiple arrests, a conviction, or a drug test - it doesn't say anything about a single charge without a conviction. Perhaps an admission of possession would be enough? (Arrest report alleges he admitted possession of suboxone without a prescription.)"	0

If he starts with these seven countries, where does it end? He's also promised to tear up NAFTA.

As is, there is a shortage of tech workers in the US. Does he expect knuckle dragging white nationalists to fill in?	0
The challenge of the gospel, and the whole meaning of Lent, is to believe in God through Jesus, not in the church, which is nothing more than a vehicle, always flawed, through which the past encounters the present and future.

That is what you keep telling yourself. No one is grabbing your guns and gun control laws do not affect law-abiding citizens, if in fact you are. And, gun ownership should not be unqualified. For example, there is no need for individuals to own guns meant for assault and assault only. They are fun to shoot, I agree. So maybe you could go to the gun range and use their assault weapons, that they have permits for, under supervision. That is how the 2nd amendment was originally intended. In the first battle of the Revolutionary War at the North Bridge, the British soldiers (everyone in America was British at the time), were on their way to the weapons depot where they were all kept. But the rebels got to it first and met them on the other side of the bridge. You really need to learn American history in order to understand the Constitution. The 2nd amendment referred to a standing militia, not individual gun ownership. As such, there should be sanity in gun control laws.	0
"I don't feel safe when there is a soldier or a dozen standing around with rifles at the ready. That's not freedom and, frankly, it's not safe. These men and women are trained killers, guided to believe that everyone not wearing the same uniform is a potential threat. I am less likely to avoid a cultural event if there is little or no security because the chance of a terrorist targeting it is far less than that one of our ""guardians of security"" might mistake normal human interaction as a threat and arrest, assault or kill someone who is just having a good time. This article completely ignores the fact that these attacks happen in ""gun-free zones"" where the intended victims have been deliberately stripped of any ability to protect themselves. While concealed carry could not have addressed the Manchester suicide bomber, it would have reduced the carnage in Orlando and Aurora substantially ... but, STILL, the ideologues refuse to accept that an armed society is a safer society."	0

It absolutely is, but colleges don't need to sponsor it, for the most part that hateful and derogatory speech has pretty much zero redeeming value.

"Look closely. I do maintain that all sexualities or genders except heterosexuality are either a choice or a disorder.. You may call a disorder a disease. I base this statement on science, logic and the definition of disorder ""something which inhibits or interferes with a normal function or an established system"". Mating, pairing to reproduce, is our normal function and established system. Reproduction is a continuum of life in which living heterosexual cells combine, sharing all the genetic history of both biological parents. No other sexual or gender relationship can achieve this unique process necessary for life on earth. They inhibit it. Disorder. I have presented a civilized rational discussion of the facts. Prove them wrong or accept them. Anything else is uncivilized."	0

I just read the memo beginning to end. Was Damore asked to research and write this memo? If not, then he should have been tossed out so fast that he would have road rash on his butt. It wouldn't matter if he had re-iterated everything the board just said, you can not run a company with subversives or people claiming power that isn't theirs. Management makes mistakes, everyone has had an idiot boss. The place for discussion of company direction is not in an email being spread throughout a company. That is underhanded. I find it curious that conservatives, of all people, wouldn't understand that. Google is a corporation. Damore was unbelievably naive and stupid if didn't think he would get canned for this.	1

"The problem with that is not people you consider ""trolls"" - which, I suspect come from both sides of the aisle.... The problem is that a blocking feature creates self-congratulatory, closed cliques who don't discuss opposing points of view with any degree of civility or attempt at understanding. There is then no free and respectful exchange of ideas. What should happen - and I hope it does - is that the name-calling, sarcastic put-downs, and general nastiness is overcome by adult behavior and reason. Accusations then would not be answered by defensive remarks, and conversations would not take an immediate downturn into more snark and nastiness. Perhaps we can start by ceasing to call those with whom we disagree ""trolls""?"	0

In the US, after over 70 years of the most fluoridated country in the world, over 90% of children have dental decay. What a dismal record for fluoride. But even worse, Fluoride causes lowered IQ and ADHD in children. The EPA has now classified fluoride as a neurotoxin (nerve and brain poison). Also, the world's most renowned medical journal, “LANCET,” in 2014 reported that fluoride is a neurotoxin in the same category as mercury, lead and arsenic. Fluoridation causes enamel damage (dental fluorosis) in 41% of all children (CDC data) and has also been shown to lower IQ in children with 50 research studies. Now it has been proven to cause ADHD, as reported in the “Journal of Environmental Health” (by Malin & Till, 2015).	0

Dear author, my comment was subtly referring to the fact that Corbyn's ideas you condemn as communist (which in reality are merely social democratic) work quite well in other countries, such as Norway. For instance, their education is free and funded from tax revenues, prison system is on of the best in the world with only 25% of inmates returning to serve another sentence (astonishing rate compare to roughly 75% in US), and amazing healthcare system. All of this is partially funded by, for example, higher corporate tax rates (24% compared to UK's 19%). I just merely want to point out that youth in Britain is not intending to create Ingsoc, but merely understands that sometimes markets need regulating.	0

The comedian in Vancouver didn't cave, he lost. Here's what that was about: 1. The comedian started abusing two lesbian audience members after one kissed the other. (What he actually said wouldn't make it past the moderator.) He continued with similar abuse after his act, cornering one of them as she she returned from the washroom. He physically intimidated her, grabbing and breaking her sunglasses. Unsurprisingly, he lost, and was ordered to pay $15,000 total to the two women he abused. 2. The comedian appealed the Tribunal decision to the BC Supreme Court. He lost again. When will it dawn on you that you've been lied to about what Human Rights tribunals do?	0

You forget that there were Palestinian Jews still living in their homeland, a Jewish homeland that predates Islam, Arabs and all that. Israel came out of them and immigration from Europe of Jewish refugees of the Holocaust. Palestinian Arabs painted their own downfall when they initiated war. Everything else you wrote is rather long but immaterial. If you want to say that people on both sides...did bad things, why not? That is war, eh? Even in all the wars our nation fought, we committed our shares of war crimes. Maybe what you should do is explain why no other Arab nations wants to take in the Palestinians? They were rejected from Lebanon, Syria and Jordan......Saudi Arabia nor Egypt wants them. One must wonder why Palestinian Arabs are so disliked and distrusted by their fellow Arabs despite of sharing the common faith. First step for the Palestinian people to do maybe is to acknowledge Israel's right to exist. From there, something could be done?	0

Agreed. My ancestors were driven off of their little plots of land (crofts) in the Scottish Highlands by the English and forcibly deported to Canada in the 1840's.

Sure on the surface that is true - until you realize the consultation is nothing more than a game of making it appear as though the salesperson is on your side in attempt to weaken your position. In some cases there is little evidence that the sales person has even talked to the manager. Bottom line is that the sale staff know what the minimum sales price that will be accepted by the dealership. The game is how much margin is the sales person willing to accept to make a sale while making the customer feel like they got a bargain. Often to the point of implying that the sales person won't make any money on the deal.	0

Meanwhile, Bob Mueller and the FBI couldn't care less what you and I and the news pundits think. Trump and others are in serious jeopardy for a wide variety of activities (some of which, like real estate deals and money laundering, have hardly made the news at all.) The FBI will continue to grind away on the various investigations and come to whatever conclusions they come to...and no amount of spin will have any effect on that.	0

I think we have show we can be honest without being rude Bill and I appreciate that. . I hope we can keep working on that, (we'll probably have some bad days LOL). Part of racism is just natural. Human's organize by tribe or by similar traits, most animals organize that way. Look at other primates. Primate groups will kill each other. But we are the only species that has so much complexity to our society, and we live in close proximity in a lot of urban areas. That create stress and conflict. If the groups don't decide on common civil behavior, there will be more violence. It's a story as old as history. The problem with protest is that they are by nature one sided. Hopefully, that leads to real conversation, but that's hard with racist on both sides doing nothing but shouting. There is No equivalence in the damage down by white racism against black, versus black discrimination against whites. That doesn't mean black racism doesn't exist.	1

T. gondii reproduces exclusively in feline digestive tracts, and wild native felines for the most part avoid human settlements. Feral ""house"" cats are attracted to them, usually by irresponsible folks who feed them. Sorry, sonny--you're still wrong. ""When I debate with a reasonable man, I win.

I agree with you that many of the Regents generally do not have enough knowledge in research and higher education to actually do a good job running UA. They are, for the most part, good ol' boy and good ol' girl business buddies of the governors and legislature. So, once again, we have our government to blame for stacking the BOR with people who aren't up to the task. As for Jim Johnsen, I generally disagree with your assessment. I think he is working hard to do what he can. He has modified the Strategic Pathways process in response to comments and criticisms and he certainly didn't make the decision to move the nationally ranked School of Education from its home at UAF to UAS. That ridiculous decision was made solely by the BOR. Their vote on that issue was unanimous, which demonstrates a concerning lack of independent thought on that board.	0

The details disclosed do not indicate that they are doing any tax planning beyond maximizing their TFSAs. Olivia should be maximizing her RRSP if room is available.

In future they will be able to split their private pension and RRIF incomes to equalize their taxes and both will avoid the higher tax brackets	0

The miracle was enabled by ""The Bank of Canada...bought Government of Canada bonds and paid for them with newly minted cash.

amazing how simple minded fools belittle my mother's accomplishments, especially after she spent 40+ years fighting for better safety laws protecting blue collar workers. You're not going to find anything on the subject today as for the last 30 years there has been a war on tobacco. Everything written on the subject covers a heavy smoker., which as I stated is quite harmful and especially for asthma. Before inhalers and drugs, doctors-nurses prescribed 1 cigarette a day to help asthma patients as you will find all over Google, people who attest a smoke helped them breath easier. That's 1 a day, not 20. this is why back in the 60's my mother told patients to do just that, which was common, not because of big tobacco as your delusions allude to when demonizing the industries she worked for with grade school tripe.	1

"""We have to choose to stop invasion of fake news"" Completely agree, of course, but as we witnessed the past year in these comment threads and beyond, parsing fact from fiction has zero effect on partisans. If people are convinced that Hillary is a corrupt baby killer BENGHAZI emails! and (my favorite, often accompanied by the wistful asides of the wise) that ""both candidates are the worst ever,"" as if there were not orders of magnitudes of difference between them, no volume of reality-based data matters. There have been far worse candidates than Hillary Clinton, but Trump is the worst of them all. Every charge against Hillary made by Trump and his supporters appear to have been sheer projection.

"Blame the media happens when those who control the power of a system through non-transpearancy, are exposed of their deceit, to those that are subject to this system. Blame is a well-used diversionary tactic to continue the criminal misbehavior. We live in a system that has declared war on whistle blowers. Twice as many whistle blowers have prosecuted under the present administration than in the past. There is a conspiracy of ""circle the wagons"" around a deceitful state because of fear. Democracy cannot exist when elected officials hide behind a wall of secrecy, while justifying secrecy as necessary to keep information from enemies. The future is bleak if citizens are kept in the dark, since power corrupts the powerful, especially in a time when the media has been degraded to merely providing a circus-like diversion, and limited to only presenting the chosen narrative of the powerful. Kenoi is a small time, sad, Shakespearean actor, in a larger national tragedy."	0

The bigger question is if a golf course the best use of City lands when such a small percentage of people play golf.

In an urban environment the city should be trying to maximize the the use and efficiency of City owned lands and parks. I'm not sure a golf course is the best use. That's a lot of land that only about 70 people can be using at any given time. PS, I say this as someone who plays golf	0

Jerry Jones is correct about the Dispatch . What's even worse is they use the news pages to push their agenda . One time six people were shot in one incident in downtown Anchorage--the most at one time in our cities history . The Dispatch put what should have been front page news in bold print back in the B section. What did the Dispatch editors deem more important for readers to see--the Palin party fist fight where no one got seriously hurt. To be fair though , there is more going on than just the Dispatch pushing the liberal agenda on every page. Conservatives don't stand up and fight on issues. They lay down and let liberals do all the talking . They don't write many letters to the editor on issues because they feel it's a waste of time. They don't use social media to organize protests to fool Murkowski into thinking everyone thinks like them , when the majority doesn't . Worse--they don't get out and vote allowing liberals to get elected raising our taxes and legalizing dope.	0
So what are you advocating here, that we let serial rapists continue to rape because all women are liars? I'm talking about a case that really happened. In fact, I could be talking about any number of cases where a serial rapist attacked multiple women before being caught. What you're talking about is imaginary. In any case, threatening to go to police isn't a crime. If somebody repeatedly went to police to accuse men of sexual assault, the police would know from their investigation and act accordingly. The bottom line is that most men accused of sexual assault will not have their name published, unless they're convicted. It's a red herring.	1
"Yes, but when you say ""all Muslims want Jihad"" -- and there are people who say this, many of them Trump supporters -- then you should label them Islamophobes.

"My observations and experience tell me something different. Those that have been raised in even non-observant Catholic homes are indeed aware of the general flow of the Church. Those who have no experience growing up with the faith in homes with ""nones"" who were once Catholics, also have some awareness of the currents of Catholicism - in particular, Pope Francis. I would not write them off so easily, Tri. They have no interest in being members of ""your"" type of Church, but they find an attraction to the messages of Christianity, of the mercy and love found in Pope Francis, and many of the clergy, religious and Catholic faithful they encounter. They clearly reject the rigidity of the ""institutional"" church and likewise most of its bishops. And their desire to help others and the earth is amazing. Too many are lost to us for various reasons, but it is rarely of their own doing."	0

As an Alberta dentist who was on the board and has practised over 30 years I agree checkups and cleanings in particular have become too expensive. Many changes need to be made to make delivery of dental care more affordable- the Health Minister and dental authority are missing some critical issues- protectionism is rewarded with competitors using the complaint system to torture any dentist who advertises a threat to their services. The Competition Bureau should be asked to review the advertising regulations which are the most ridiculous in North America. Too many authority lawyers and 'old boys' are micromanaging the profession driving many of the top practitioners out of service. Badgering dentists who offer charity work or more affordable alternatives - word for word censorship includes bans on 'smile makeover' and use of the term 'free consultation' ...and visual censorship of before & after photos of repaired teeth. Time-limited discounts are professional misconduct. GMAB ADA&C.	0

Alexandra, you're forgetting a few things: 1. Most immigrants aren’t Muslims—and Muslims are the problem. The Quran is a manifesto for violence--please read it. (And often it’s the 2nd generation that’s the real problem, as we’ve learned in the UK.) 2. We’re not talking about ‘crimes’, which includes everything from shoplifting to joyriding and so on, but about acts of terrorism. 3. The fact that American citizens commit crimes (including, rarely, terrorism, eg James Hodgkinson) is no reason to make things worse by permitting entry to potential terrorists. Do you think the US was wrong to ban entry to Communists during the Cold War? Don’t governments have a duty to protect their citizens?	1

Just when you thought your health care was safe... Graham-Cassidy could be even more damaging than repealing Obamacare without a replacement, a new study says. At the core of Graham-Cassidy are provisions that repeal Obamacare tax credits for middle-income individuals, certain other subsidies for lower-income Americans, and the law’s Medicaid expansion. It replaces all of these provisions with a block grant that is smaller than the total amount of the money it takes away. The block grant then expires in 2027, causing health care spending to fall off a cliff. Projections from the CBO have estimated that repealing the ACA without a replacement would leave around 32 million people without coverage; the CBPP report argues the Graham-Cassidy bill could lead to an even higher number. Better call Congress again. This is worse than what they couldn't pass last spring.	0

"The left hand doesn't know what the very small right hand is doing: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley lashed out at leaks of classified information in a Fox News story Tuesday morning on North Korean missiles, saying it is “incredibly dangerous” that it was reported, even after President Trump tweeted out the story. [to his millions of followers] The story used anonymous sources to report that North Korea loaded anti-ship missiles onto a patrol boat near the coast, something that Haley refused to confirm or comment on because it is “classified information.” Her comments on ""Fox & Friends"" bashing the spread of classified information come after Trump retweeted the article that uses anonymous sources."	0

They are not dumb, and the quickly realize that they can get a very tasty meal with hardly any effort at all just by visiting a nearby ranch. In order for wolves to stay away from humans, they have to fear us. And the best way to teach wolves to stay away is to shoot them. Again, wolves are not dumb, and they will quickly figure out that it is not safe to prey on livestock, when all of their friends who do end up dead."	1

"A silly piece about a title never sought. If he looks at all like a leader, it's only because people compare him to Trump. Regarding Khadr, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that his rights were violated. The government had the choice between settling or going to court, and he would have received much more than he did. Given the writer's distaste for defecit spending, it's odd he would prefer giving more to Khadr. He was a child (15 years old at the time), who was radicalized by an abusive parent. He confessed to a murder under duress (including torture), and spent a decade in Guantanamo. If you don't consider him a ""child soldier"", that makes him a soldier. The logical conclusion can only be that the death of an American soldier, awful and tragic as it is, was an act of war. You can't have it both ways. Would that soldier gone to jail if he had killed Khadr? No, he wouldn't have. What was your judgment like as a 15 year old child, living in a presumably ""normal home""? LOL"	1

If the defining element of my personality and common humanity is ""toxic"" to you, then you are a bigot and a sexist, and there's no way around it. You dehumanize me with your insults, and if feminism requires you to dehumanize half of your speciees, I don't want to be a feminist after all, and I'll do anything I can to stop you from abusing me and my friends. Your arrogance is monumental, and is clearly based on ignorance and self-promotion.

Yes, he sometimes needs to consult advisors or stop making statements until the specifics are in place, but, he is shaking things up. We cannot mistake what he says he wants to do with what actually gets done. His announcements reflect his goal but not necessarily how-that he leaves up to the house/senate. Yet, we blame Trump for their ineptness.	1
"You make a few claims in your proposition that the market will a least limit health care costs. One is ""My comments are based on basic economics."" How are they based on basic economics? Does the desire to treat one's body or save one's life just another consumable like wanting a car or a TV? Who wants ""budget"" healthcare or life saving treatments? Would anyone ask, ""is there a cheaper heart bypass that while not quite as good, still meets most people's needs?"" If the rich can afford the greatest and most expensive care, does that not push prices up according to ""basic economics""? Another claim: ""Cuba does not allow verification of their statistics; that means there is something to hide."" Your logic to dismiss the Cuba stats is: not verifiable according to some criteria (what criteria?), if not verifiable, then something to hide, if hiding something, then not accurate stats. How do we know that? Using a different metric, maybe Cuba has more cost-effective healthcare?"	0

Who are the patsies here? Obviously the American public, persuaded to vote for a completely off-the-wall candidate just because he wasn't Hilary Clinton---Or persuaded to vote for Clinton, because she WASN'T Trump! The show continues, ostensibly for our ""benefit"": The American electorate, arguing over crumbs, window displays, lapel pins, innuendo, nuances of ideology; hopelessly divided and largely ineffectual, while a consortium of media interests and a well developed right-wing echo chamber craft Trump into a super-majority, able to override a veto by that long-neglected player, Reality. If you can't see where this is going, perhaps there is still room for you in a soviet-style reeducation camp---I'm sure Putin will be happy to foot the bill."	1

Claiming that Obama “tapped his wires” at Trump Tower. The Obama administration says, “It’s absurd! It’s ridiculous! Trump’s insane! This is lunacy!”And now we’ve learned everything. We learned that Susan Rice was unmasking and requesting and that there was surveillance of Trump people, be it incidentally or direct. Trump was right.He was not surveilled. Flynn was not under surveillance. The Russian ambassador was. We should never have known who the Russian ambassador was talking to, but the Democrats, the Obama holdovers — think Evelyn Farkas — are the people that unmasked Flynn, made his name public and associated it with all those leaks from the so-called intel community that were happening in late December and January. If anybody ought to be asking for immunity, it’s whoever it is that unmasked Flynn and blabbed to the media that he’s the guy the Russian ambassador was talking to when this particular surveillance was documented and transcribed.	1

She implies Pres.-elect Trump will be a tyrant, but ignores the tyranny of President Obama, ignores Obama's vilification of police and the military, ignores the violence inspired by the dishonest and biased press and Obama's and Hillary's tacit approval of this violence by virtue of their failing to call for calm and peace. Ms. Cooper is a fine example of what is dividing this country. She is too ideologically entrenched in liberalism to give Pres.-elect Trump a chance, just as Obama and Hillary are too ideologically entrenched (alt-left) to exercise common sense.

Your tax dollars hard at work buying votes for Democrats. 99% of evictions are because either A) a tenant has not paid their rent or B) they are a nuisance or dangerous to other tenants. Providing them free legal counsel will only result in increasing costs for landlords - thus driving up rents. Ultimately it will make it more difficult for borderline candidates to rent an apartment. Landlords will demand higher credit scores, a more stable job history and higher security deposits. Ironically this proposal will speed up gentrification as landlords become more selective to whom they rent. Some chose to sell, resulting in the bulldozing of older, more affordable housing stock. Landlords hate evictions - they are expensive. Lawyers don't work for free. An eviction ensures that any unpaid back rent is lost. Contrary to what Hancock and Co. seem to believe there is no advantage to evicting a tenant. Can rent control be far behind if Denver has reached this level of stupid?	1

"The players have a right to do so but their actions are foolish and naive. They see their protests as somehow an agent of change which will move the country toward less discrimination; but in reality it has the opposite effect in that it just brings more rancor and divisiveness. If we go back in history we can learn a good lesson from the example of the Japanese Americans during WWII. They were discriminated against and lost homes, properties, businesses and their livelihoods - not to mention incarcerated despite being American citizens. If you want to talk discrimination today, just ask those Japanese Americans what it was like to be discriminated against back then. That should bring things into real perspective. Back then they didn't ""protest."" Instead, the young men risked their lives to fight and die for the very country that incarcerated their loved ones. Discrimination was overcome through a set of values and self-sacrifice. What is happening today will not accomplish anything."	1

How much does road infrastructure cost -- both capital and maintenance? Much of this comes out of the general fund by the way.

"A general rule is it costs about 1% to maintain a home but with our bloated real estate assessments, this is not realistic. A ""normal"" home costs about 1K a month BEFORE mortgage. For us, we have a townhome. 350 a month for strata fees, 400 a month for property taxes, 40 a month for a security system/monitoring, and 200 a month on average for electricity (we heat with electricity which is way more expensive but less to maintain). This is not including any special assessments or anything that might happen (you have other expenses that is all on you if you own a detached home). Optimistic people like these folks almost NEVER look into how much it actually costs to run a home. If they are paying 1K a month in rent, I would continue to rent and let the owner shoulder the responsibilities and subsidize your lifestyle.

They've spent years following media sources that encourage and reinforce their paranoid delusions about what's happening in the world, and have now reached the point where reality itself is offensive to them. Want proof? Fox News puts forward a few new conspiracy theories every day but most aren't seriously challenged for accuracy because... well... it's Fox. But as soon as Trump claimed a Fox theory to be true, it took only a few days before Fox complete reversed their claims and everybody backed away from it. The only person still clinging to Fox's fiction is Trump, who is too stupid to know better. Everyone else ran the other way.	1
"Yes, and the poor guy was just crying, ""I gotta go home, I gotta go home..."" how they know what's happening in that guy's life(?) maybe something tragic happened at home and he needed to return as soon as possible, and to be treated like that, like an animal, there's no excuse for this, no excuse."	0
"People come here because they are fleeing hunger, violence, and an inability to provide for their families. The reason that many of them cannot regularize their status, as people were able to do in the past, is because we live under a mean-spirited and counter-productive law that was passed in 1996. We could easily change this law to make it possible for those who contribute to the economy and who do not break laws to regularize their status, so that they will no longer be without it. If we had a rational, humane immigration law, then we would, once again, experience something that is called ""circular migration, ie people coming here to work for a number of years and then returning to their home countries, able to buy land or start a business with the money that they made here. This improves the economies of the home countries, which, in turn, reduces the need for economic migration. There is, of course, more to it, but this would be a start."	0

The Trumpeople and white Evangelical Trumpeople better have as much of a really good time forcing themselves on Americans because everything they do is going to come back on them for years to come and not just politically but where they live, worship, eat, shop and have businesses. There are many perfectly legal ways to play with people's comfort, people's sense--whether real of not--of safety. This they will lose for their racist, un-American and fascistic political behavior. Evangelicals have many irrational fears which up to now we have left alone. This will change. They will be sorry.	0

On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron."""	1

Wow, Mr. Brooks, I am impressed. As a Trump voter, you captured my perspective entirely. It is about changing broken systems. It is about a new perspective wherein all American voters will prosper.

"Trump gives the media a lot to work with. Here's a Trump quote from a week before Christmas: ""You people were vicious, violent, screaming, 'Where's the wall? We want the wall!' Screaming, 'Prison! Prison! Lock her up!' I mean you are going crazy. I mean, you were nasty and mean and vicious and you wanted to win, right?"" Trump said Friday. ""But now, you're mellow and you're cool and you're not nearly as vicious or violent, right? Because we won, right?"" If Trump was against violence, then he might have spoken out against it when it arose. The quote clearly indicates that Trump thinks vicious and violent are part of a winning strategy."	1

Of course I went to the website, have been there before. Basically it is a website and an organization ,which sole function seems to be PR. There seems to be little else but a total support for PR. So your claim that all meetings supported PR according to Fair Vote would hardly be unbiased. Being a non-partisan organization doesn't automatically confer credibility. There would be an assumption that if what you said was true , Fair vote would be crowing about it on their webpage. I didn't see it, and this is the first i have heard of it and you would think they wouldn't have used an anonymous person like yourself to break the news.. People can prefer the status quo, after looking at the changes offered, and deciding the status quo is better. Fair Vote has been a one trick pony for over a decade,.	0

On the contrary, new immigrant men (women were finally allowed to apply for naturalization on their own in 1924), had to file 1st & 2nd Declarations of Intent & then pass character & knowledge tests before final naturalization.

"You claimed the press gets a free pass to libel people. As you just admitted that is wrong. In fact, since you actually know the basis on which people can successfully sue the media for libel, it's deliberately wrong.

If Trump wants to reverse that, he will pay the price - no matter how many times he brays his idiot mantra ""fake news."""	1

If you haven't kept up with recent genetic research, I can't help you. It appears, indeed, that empathy/sympathy may have a genetic component, as does alcoholism, blue-eyes, or intelligence. I don't know as one can blame Eugenics on Oregon--- I hope you can provide some sort of connection? Eugene=Eugene-ics? I myself am atheist (an agnostic is a pathetic creature, is he not--- one who cannot simply demand proof and make a decision based on that elementary question) but find both the Old and New Testaments have some very profound things to say. That is one of them that I agree with. If one wishes to be charitable, it seems to me that one should do so in private. To depend on the largesse of the 1% to solve societies' greatest problems is to place oneself into a debt to individuals to which I am unwilling to do so. It is the responsibility of governments to fund scientific research, properly fund higher education, etc. Europe has done quite well with that system, as has Scandinavia.	0

If you want a credible investigation, look at the years - long investigation by the GW Bush Justice Dept. They REALLY wanted to find voter fraud, but in their final report found voter fraud nation-wide to be functionally zero, that is, there was very little of it, what there was was mostly unintentional, and in only one local election where the total vote count was less than a thousand did the fraud affect the election outcome. 5.7 million fraudulent votes?

The most destructive decision that was ever imposed on democracy was Citizens United by the Supreme Court. Citizens United wanted to show an anti-Hillary film and was sued. The resulting decision opened the flood gates of corporate oligarchy money influencing, perverting, and overwhelming the political process.

Justice Stephens and Ginsburg, in the minority dissented against the decision. Thank you!

I have serious doubts about the intellect of public school teachers in Hawaii when they ignore the massive, wasteful, super expensive and antiquated DOE bureaucracy in their pleadings for higher pay. Clearly, tax dollars for education are being systematically diverted by Democrats to their campaign signwaving buddies at the HGEA and UPW at the expense of actual schools and the #1 school resource: teachers. Simple kindergarten level math shows how downsizing the wasteful DOE bureaucracy would free up more than enough money to compensate government school teachers quite well, based on merit of course. But these HSTA union teachers either don't recognize the wasted funds on excessive bureaucracy or they are too cowardly to expose the DOE unions. Heck, classrooms would all be air conditioned if teachers led the charge to reform the wasteful DOE. So until teachers come around, I don't want to hear any more whining from them.	0

All the pro-Organic and pro-GMO-labeling groups are very strongly against this bill, and all the big agri-businesses are strongly pushing it.

"A fair article. My opinion is things have been skewed in terms of fear with Trump's bluster and stance on trade, protectionism, immigration etc..

Also, he freely speaks his mind and seems to not be bothered on how he comes across. But no one knows whether he will be an effective president. If it turns out he is effective it could be all overshadowed by his personality flaws and the fault there rests with him. Showboat politicians do get elected, Canada had Pierre Trudeau and he divided the country more than any prime minister that I recall. I remember the finger, ""fuddle duddle"" etc..

"False! A treaty is an agreement under international law entered into by actors in international law, namely sovereign states and international organizations. A treaty may also be known as an (international) agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms. Regardless of terminology, all of these forms of agreements are, under international law, equally considered treaties and the rules are the same. In the United States, the term ""treaty"" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law."	0

As for the physical confiscation of ALL firearms, that is flat impossible. Just during one administration - - that of Obama - - legal sales of fire arms and ammunition skyrocketed. And, given Obama’s relentless 8 year war on white cops, no wonder.	0
"""I think something that isn't explored is that 99% of those who claim this religions exemption only target one group - homosexuals. They never target adultery or other sins that the bible talks about. This to me shows that it's not really about religion at all."" Agreed. There are a lot of fake Christians out there who have a problem with gay marriage but if you a convicted murderer.. not a problem. See Richard Ramirez who was known in the 1980's as the Night Stalker. A convicted serial killer who was married at San Quentin in 1996. Don't remember a whole lot of (if any) religious groups protesting this marriage. The Little Guy"	1

This is SOOOO wrong. I have no issue with taking out recent statues, and stopping any more from being built. BUT, to destroy something from 100 years ago OR OLDER, is just wrong. If they must, then bring it down and put it in a state museum to describe the civil war and the state's actions in it. But to bring these down AND DESTROY them, makes these ppl no different than ISIS or even the very NAZIs/KKK that they oppose. This destruction of history MUST STOP.	0

Most unilingual Anglophones left Sherbrooke and The Eastern Townships beginning in 1976 with the coming to power of Levesque and the PQ (BTW - even Renee Levesque would not have been this insensitive and obtuse in such a situation) but it is disingenuous Liberal spin to claim that Sherbrooke is almost purely French. This is a red herring in any case. The crux of the matter is what is the real purpose of this Listening To Canadians Tour? Is it as claimed - an opportunity for Trudeau to listen to the real concerns of Canadians and to respond substantively and helpfully if he can? Or is it just another campaign con in which Trudeau goes around reciting the same vague, simplistic, unhelpful talking points in his fake sincerity and bonhomie fashion? He had no interest in helping this woman or even responding in a language she understood. He could care less about her, he was playing to the crowd. So its really the I'll Hold The Bullhorn And You'll Listen Tour.	1

"It was going to be a long shot that the Broncos would rise again this year. There were just too many holes to fill. However the season unveils itself with the, defensive line --improved, tight end position --improved, offensive line --improved, running back position --improved and the return game --improved. Hope fades... From there it starts to go downhill, the QB position isn't much improved and now Siemian may be hurt --disaster! The no fly zone is reeling from the loss of TJ Ward. While Simmons is tall and a ""good prospect"" he is not a physical player in the tradition of a Broncos Safety. He also looks lost often. The coaching changes at the Head Coach position and the Defensive/Offensive Coordinator positions are not looking like an improvement. This is the second game this year where the Broncos were caught totally flat footed. Nerves and a lack of confidence have crept into their heads now. That's on the ""Head"" Coach."	0

I don't think the GOP can go on this way without absolutely destroying America. Trump, as the embodiement of More, Bigger and Louder, without Quality, without Responsible forethought, without caring, and exuding the the ugliness of what happens when self interest becomes unchecked, has the ability to accelerate that destruction and neutralize America's natural defenses to that happening at the hands of any individual, group or political party. Trump's fatness is a metaphor for a lot. I think it should be discussed extensively both for the criticism it invites, the consequences it portends, and because, most of all, We ALL want America to be Great. If you are honest, you must conced that It cannot be under Trump. . . if for no other reason, but just one of many reasons, than he is getting too fat.	1

Not sure Max is astute enough to know that. Harper kept him at arm’s length ever since the bikergate fiasco, and it wasn’t just for appearances. He wouldn’t toe the party line if it conflicted with his beliefs. Ambrose, on the other hand, was shrewd enough to temper her position. This might speak well of Maxime’s personal integrity (even if you don’t agree with his positions), but it doesn’t bode well in terms of swaying people who think a flat tax or a return to the gold standard would be, like, stupid. And opening up the abortion debate is strictly third rail, even if it is put to a free vote. Harper knew this only too well.	1
Maggie's permitted to air her solidly left-wing view of Obama and we who differ with her on that view are free to dismiss it as a broken-hearted lullaby, to plagiarize Sassy Sarah Vaughan. It was good that America elected a black president. He was, however, a disaster in foreign policy, a pushover who paved the way for the kickback that brought us the even more disastrous Donald Trump and his fellow-thug Putin. Obama was well qualified on domestic issues, an inner-city fixer, but as incompetent on the world stage as Ike, who, like Barrack, simply invited bullies to swing away. As a bulwark against bullies, you have to have credibility and Obama's red lines left us all simply red-faced when adversaries laughed at and ignored them. It was nice that he had class. It would be nice if Trump wasn't the lowest of low-brow. But you don't bring just class to a gunfight.	0

Good leadership means working well with others - not spouting at the mouth with threats and empty bombast. The Canadian/US trade relationship is very complex and intertwined - it's not just black and white. And no one can afford to damage it - on either side. There's too much at stake. Back in the eighties and nineties I represented Canada in some agriculture trade deals, and I learned that the best way to deal with the Americans is to stand up to them, and give as good (or better) than you get. They'll actually respect you for it and try to become your friend. Then you get to control the debate and get the better deal. It's how you treat any bully and win. Ask anyone.	0

I have had an interesting life with raising my 6 kids them plus my foster kids. Responsibility is something that kids need to have and as a parent it is part of your job. I loved all my kids, but I was a parent to them and not a “friend”. Did my kids screw up ? Hell, yes they did ! Have I screwed up ? Of course I have. I was raised in a culture where our elders often used stories to teach us all sorts of things. When we messed up, we got more stories plus we were taught that just saying “sorry” isn’t enough. We were taught to make amends by following what they told us we needed to do. If we wronged someone, we had to not only apologize but we had to so something to make it right. If we pulled up and ate all of the neighbor’s carrots we had to own up, apologize and do something like gather and chop wood or carry water for them. We use to get into lots of trouble but as we got older we knew right from wrong and if you messed up what you needed to do. Empathy? I have plenty of it.	1
What you said does, at times, happen because scientists are human. But it is patantely false to suggest that this effect of bias is widespread. First, scientific training prepares scientists to avoid and eliminate bias. Second, the peer review process (which, contrary to many of the ill informed comments on these boards) works to sift out work that doesn't appear to be supported. Third, science involves replication, and a biased work will fairly quickly be exposed and discredited.	0

"Nope, I don't think I'm superior. I think philosophy teaches a superior way of thinking. The difference is subtle but important. People with no philosophy training tend to be wrong about most things, most of the time because, absent that training their only tool for understanding the world is intuition - which is an incredibly fallible tool that rarely gets things right. Einstein summed it up best when he said: ""The greatest enemy of science is common sense"". Common sense is just another term for ""intuitive thinking"". It makes intuitive sense that if government spends less money, it will have more money and won't have a deficit. But logic has proven that when government spends less money it reduces it's own revenue by MORE than it reduces it's expenses and deficits actually get WORSE under austerity. Mountains of empirical data show that this is what happens, logic explains *why*. In reality, it turns out, the common sense of austerity is like burning your paycheck to save on heating"	0

I for one do NOT want US dairy products flooding into Canada. These products are produced with the excess use of growth hormones (illegal in Canada BTW) and antibiotics. Also, Canadian dairy practices are highly automated, while US farms use low wage (many illegal) workers. Every time I go to the US and drink milk, eat eggs and cheese products made in the USA I get sick! So yes we pay more for milk products and eggs too made and protected in Canada, but is the health of ourselves and our kids not worth it? US has no restrictions on how much milk US farm can produce and now they have a glut of milk and many producers on the very of bankruptcy. They want to 'ease' the situation by selling into Canada and putting CDN farms at risk of that same. What does that tell you! US business practices are Shite!	0

youtube can teach me most of what i want to learn. teachers trying to teach teens things they have no interest in is futile. education is the largest single business on earth and until parents dig around on youtube to see just how they were indoctrinated, and how their kids are being indoctrinated, education will remain the exclusive realm of the rich. depending on your socio-economic status your kid is being groomed to be a prince harry, a kushner, a day laborer, a soldier or a homeless person. the internet can have a levelling effect if our education, if administrators incorporate it 100% into the curriculum. it could work since the rich have separated themselves from humanity by money and christians by home schooling. that just leaves the poor and marginalized, who just happen to be the majority of us.	0

LW1 - I realize my viewpoint probably won't be popular. My advice to parents in this situation is to recognize that even at 17, they are basically adults. Whatever life skills you've given them, they have even if it isn't apparent at 17 (or 20, 25, should I go higher?....lol). So digging in on language with your son at 17 yrs of age is not a wise choice. Will using a bad word kill him? Take his education away? Take his gf away? Probably not, so why apply that pressure at that point in time?! He's 17. Let it be. If you've done your job and I suspect you have all those years while he was growing up, he'll be just fine even if he uses curse words and breaks all the other rules we parents think are important (but really aren't). My guess is dad has his dad voice and he used it for the language lecture. The son is clearly asserting his ability to disengage. And sons will do that till the end of time if dad doens't take the higher road and get over his dad ego. That ship has sailed.	0
It is a family planning issue and reproductive choice for men and women - not just a woman's issue. I mean, Tim Murphy should have been more careful to make sure that his mistress in his extramarital affair used birth control and then he wouldn't be in such a political mess for his unbelievable pro-life hypocrisy asking her to get an abortion while he is trying to legislate limited availability of abortion. Men are also responsible and should be advocating for availability of birth control. It affects men too - and boys. How can any of you justify that wildly expensive ED drugs are covered no question and the federal government spends Yugely on ED - gotta make sure it get's hard and stays hard, ya know, just listen to Rush Limbaugh - but birth control is targeted to be cut. This is a morality and women's equality issue too.	0

I do include those. Mary Kay Henry (CEO of SEIU) makes $300,000 (according to http://workercenterwatch.com/one-percenter-seiu-president-arrested-farcical-protests/ ) and SEIU has a revenue of $300 million. So she makes 1/10th the salary for running an operation with 2-3X the revenue. Given this salary rate of 0.1% of revenue, Mark Helfrich would make $100,000! PP CEO Cecile Richards' salary was $590,928 and revenue of $1.3 billion. She makes 1/6th the salary for running an organization with 10x the revenue. Given this salary rate of 0.05% of revenue, Mark Helfrich would make $50,000! I think my suggestion of a little restraint and a salary of $2M would still be extravagant by any measure. Even CEOs of for-profit companies average a total pay of $600,000 for running companies with revenues more than $100,000,000, so Helfrich is doing quite well (5x better) using for-profit companies as a yardstick.	0

The issue of how best to communicate a somewhat complex message has been a struggle for the community. Not everything in life can be reduced to 4 words on a poster, or a twitter post.

We really do think that tower is a terrible thing for the owners of JFPS (ie you and me), and the kids who go there, and will go there. Full stop. Parents are vehemently opposed to this proposal, but are genuinely not reflexively opposed to ANY tower.

Very true, but it should still have been an Oiler win if the refs, NHL video room, and NHL head office did their job. There is something wrong here. This week along, Crosby gets mugged by two Cap players with a head slash and cross-check to the face, no further suspension, but we lose the player that most fans would agree is absolutely worth watching anytime (c'mon head office, if that wasn't OV's slash, maybe a different suspension). Then Perry's interference on the first goal in Game 4 and the missed offside on the second goal that couldn't be challenged because of the lost challenge on the first goal (Oilers lose in OT). Then last night, Anaheim gets tying goal with 15 seconds to go on another clear interference. NHL seems to have rules for almost everything but lacks real judgement about what actually happened. Talbot was clearly impeded on both goals. Anaheim has benefitted from three goals at key moments, none of which should have counted. Too many rules and no judgement.	0

There's been ugly women through out history - but Clinton is not only ugly through and through down to the bone - she has a vile hideous personality that's like acid to those who have to watch, listen and deal with her. What is so disgusting - is that she feels so entitled, owed, and expects the world to kowtow, genuflect and kiss her ass because she's Hillary Clinton... while she demonstrates a penchant for a complete lack of respect for human life, the willingness to break federal laws of the USA and the world, she's a thief and a shyster, an Electon fraudster and will rig and buy votes if not outright black-mail or kill individuals that stand in her way. What she is really owed is a federal prison orange jump suit with a date scheduled to face a Firing Squad.	1

No kidding. With responsibility comes accountability. Exactly why wouldn't the Minister, with all the perks including a substantial pay raise, announce what she will be doing and what she won't be doing? Face it the crisis came about because another women, Maryam Mosef totally screwed up the file and made that embarrassing display in Parliament demonstrating that she either didn't understand the committee's report or hadn't actually read it. BTW, in all the broadcast, news article and opinion pieces, never have a read anyone blaming Gould, they all blame the Prime Minister because he clearly was out of his depth, was liar or just plain stupid for make the promise that the last election would be the last under the FPTP system.

I would like to see a federal ban on foreign real estate investment. I'm starting to think we shouldn't think of real estate as investments. I took the median family income in BC from Stats Canada, and used it in RBC's Mortgage Calc to estimate the maximum house cost they could afford. There is nothing in the GVRD that the median family income could afford, unless they had a few hundred thousand as a deposit. Keep in mind the majority of BC population is in the GVRD.	0

"Or... Those people can move to where the jobs are. Most businesses are surrounded by a "" eco system "" of suppliers , customers, workers ... that have taken years and years to put in place. To advise, "" hey just move it down the road "" is just not feasible in most cases. A move like that is a "" bet the company "" proposition. And the cold truth is , once you start thinking "" Ugh, okay we have to move it"" all of North America, including Mexico, becomes an option and the places you mention may not measure up the way you hope they do.

"So tired of all this indigenous talk. You were savages destroying each other as a means of survival. You were overrun by Europeans with superior weaponry and a population which kept coming looking for a place to put down roots to continue their civilisation. Basically you were beaten at your own game. You've managed to suck billions of dollars from the white man to carry on some idealistic lifestyle which, frankly, can and does no longer exist. Get over it and join the rest of the world and mankind and move forward. If you want to sit up in the middle of nowhere and hunt and fish do it on your own dime. You lost. This is Canada. It's not some backwater as it was 300 years ago. And I, personally, had nothing to do with it so stop trying to shame me and all the rest of us ""colonizers"" into feeling as though we did something terrible. It is the history of mankind and continues to this day. And you, Mr. Indigenous, are not immune."	1

"The very fact that this article refers to a 'ruling class' is evidence itself that we have a problem. The danger in Canada is not the drift towards US-style negative politics. It is a loss of faith in Canada's institutions. Unless government agencies like the CRA are seen to be serving Canadians equally and not avoiding the vital but challenging task of auditing illicit funds flowing in to our housing market then trust will continue to erode. If programmes such as the Business Investor programme are not monitored or are abused with impunity then, again, trust in government will suffer. Finally, if the idea that our ""ruling class"" enjoys advantages and opportunities not conferred on other Canadians then traditional politics will change for the worse. I can think of no leader who should be paying closer attention to these trends than Justin Trudeau."	0

As I said on Facebook, when someone is NOT from a certain culture (or even married to the culture), they're appropriating it. And if they ARE, then they're bastardizing.

"Now the equation is much worse. On a daily basis the fascist lunatic, Kim, threatens to ""mercilessly annihilate"" Australia, the RoK, Japan and the US; clearly, he has the capability to do it; daily his WMD and delivery capability is improving to carry out his threats. Saddam threatened international law and oil supplies as well as regional stability. Kim and his allies will very soon have the capability to destroy life on this planet. Iran is even worse than Kim in that the Ayatollahs are the world's largest state-sponsor of terrorism and they have no problem whatsoever with martyrdom if it will kill millions of Israeli and US infidels. There is debate about whether or not Kim could be deterred by a retaliatory strike. The Iranians are likely to consider themselves righteous martyrs; thus, deterrence definitely would not work with them. To a certain extent I am willing to explain the basics, but you really need to more reading about NK and Iranian nuclear threats to discuss."	1

You fail to grasp 2 facts; #1 the electoral college was established to bring the states dominated by antifederalists, on board...which didnt happen until the antifederalists got the Bill of Rights attached to the constitution. This is to assure article 10, STATE RIGHTS. We are 50 countries we call states, under 1 flag. We elect our own representatives. Without the antifederalists there is no United States of America. #2 the electoral college just did what it was intended for. To assure a minority of states do not lord over the majority. 35 states voted for Trump. Getting rid of the electoral college is as ridiculous as killing all states. this is gerrymandering to rig the election because the candidate you bought into lost 2 elections through gross incompetence she now b;lames everyone but herself for.

The world is absolutely amazed at how such power can be so gullible and how a ""ruling class"" of governance can sacriface their core to such an extent for oppertunism, in association with such a dangerous coterie. The US is becoming that which is seeks to destroy. The self-eulagized and lauded people and governance of the United States of America will not, can not expunge a racist, sexually abusive, narcissistic, megalomaniacal liar who can't see that he is making a fool of himself and the entire nation. When the majority leadership of the nation will not stand for their espoused values while facilitating the construction of a domestic and international pariah of the entire country, then why worry about that President criticizing Russia?"	1
"There is a passage in the good book that talks about evil and its ""departure"" from me. It is appropriate that we could apply that passage to the troubled and confused U.S, president Donald Trump.

"Canada has no credibility internationally on ghg emissions. We were the second worst performer of the Kyoto signatories having committed to a 6% decrease but by 2012, our emissions were up by 21%. A 27% ""miss"". Only Saudi Arabia was worse. The two main drivers of our emissions increase were; #1 mass immigration, contributing about 65% by adding 6 million people and #2, the increased production from the oil sands at around 35%. Despite the noise about a carbon tax, which is a positive measure, there is no coherent strategy to lower emissions and governments have increased even further the rate of immigration and allowed for higher oil sands production. Canada as a leader in the climate change fight is strictly an image campaign waged in and by the media. Cheers, John Meyer"	0

""" Walkerton was 2 drunken criminals."" No. They were the patsies. The company that sold the water to Walkerton was stupidly allowed to test its own product for safety, with little or no oversight from public health. Readings that were patently unsafe were suppressed because these two individuals knew that the supply would be shut down and their jobs would be on the line. Shutting down production of a major company is a difficult enough decision for public health professionals but they have the power behind them to force companies to do it. Giving two minor employees the responsibility for doing this was utter stupidity. And the situation has hardly changed. The organisation responsible for the safety of our water is still the company that sells it to us. It will happen again."	1

Just to set the record straight Bob, Bill was convicted of Contempt of Court for violating court orders to tell the truth to the Paula Jones Grand Jury from a federal judge. He was fined and voluntarily surrendered his law license in Arkansas. He was also suspended from the Supreme Court bar for a period of time but during his time to appeal that decision, Bill resigned from the Supreme Court bar. Common sense tells me that if you are convicted of contempt of court for lying to a grand jury, after being told to tell the truth, you have committed perjury. While the Clintons have been able to do anything they want, regardless of ethics or the law, at least in this one case, they did not get off scot free. While the House also considered his lying to be perjury and impeached him on those charges, the senate failed to convict. That does not mean that he did nothing wrong. A federal judge says he did and made him pay at least a little bit for violating the law.	0

This is an opinion column, that doesn't really say anything. It doesn't make a point. I know that the author wants to appear sympathetic towards Muslims, but he doesn't meet the mark. We the readers don't need to be lectured about Muslims and Islam and what they represent. If Mister Saunders knew European history, he would realize that Islam when it spreads outside its original lands, represents danger. Islam should be constrained to its lands where it came into being. Letting it out and allowing its followers into other countries is causing too much dissent and hostility. It is not compatible with our European and Western way of life. .	0

It is important to understand that part time/contract faculty should not be treated less than your average contract worker. There is no contract roofer, for eg, who would show up to a job prepared, if you told them that they may or may not get paid on Monday when they come. This is, in fact, how the colleges treat contract faculty. They tell them that they do not have a contract until days before heading into the classroom. Would anyone do a semester's worth of prep work while not knowing if you are being paid for it?	0

Sanger's anti-poor, anti-defectives and anti-Negro poor sterilization plans are a matter of record. So are Hitler's. Their implementation in Oregon and retention until 1974 is also a matter of public record. The last Oregon Court of Appeals Eugenic sterilization was in 1972. It was on a girl who was driven insane by her father's sexual abuse. She was therefore sterilized. All humans have 'feet of clay'. Sainthood is a theological concept invented to control the ignorant. It also works on secular bigots.	1

Over the past three decades Canada alone has handed over close to a million high paying manufacturing jobs to China. We have all stood by silent because our consumer society depends on their slave labor, environmental destruction, corruption and cultural genocide. We have traded our western values for cheap televisions, appliances and electronics. Trump is a fool to think it is not too late to take that back. It is gone. The west could not survive taking it back.	1
"The Narcissistic move to the left. Conervatives, the GOP, Trumpists all experience the horror of betrayal, and what betrayal portends. SOMEONE has always got to experience that in the Narcissist's world. Get it? The redeeming quality of this move is that the only thing ""hurt"" is the conservative sense of ideology. But, the conservaties will attack the same way the (former) progressive Trump haters did, and the Narcissistic need for attention and adulation will be served. Will the GOP impeach now? Three more similar moves by Trump, and I think it starts quickly. And, Trump will not understand why, or how it got that point so quickly."	1
Amazing. Honestly if you believe it's man-made. The PROBLEM. too many people on this planet. One more person borne on this planet = another human adding to global warming concerns. Go ask China to clean up it's polluting factories and to do so increase their manufacturing costs which effects everyone who imports their goods. If you believe the US can do more then the US is not to bear this problem alone as the US been trying unlike the unregulated Chinese. Go google China smog and see the pictures for yourselves! and STOP buying cheap Chinese goods as your supporting Chinese pollution.	0

"""We just want to understand what the implications will be,"" Ms. Wynne told The Globe and Mail Monday. ""I want to make sure we continue to have small businesses invest in our province and grow and thrive and so to the extent that that might be at risk, I would be worried. And that is why I think it's good that we have a conversation with the Prime Minister."" Ms. Wynne - almost any CPA could have told you within days of the stealth-mode launch of the tax reform consultation what the implications will be. They will be punishing. 70%+ tax on investments many business owners have relied on in lieu of a pension. And even higher rates if you try to pass on your business within the family.

GBA, do you realize how ridiculous you sound? While Trump may be doing what he promised, he is doing so while driving America into the ground. For all you who think that a sectionalist United States -- which is terribly hypocritical -- is the way America becomes great again, you are wrong. Trump has made America a laughing stock in just a week of Presidency because he is doing what he promised. You are a terribly uneducated, narrow-minded, hypocritical citizen. If you so purport to be a follower of Christianity and Christ, you must welcome all others just as Christ did. Be welcoming to the downtrodden, the sick, and the needy. Do not shun others because they are different from you. Oh and, by the way, let's not forget Christ and the entire foundation of Christianity was built in...where again? Oh yeah that's right THE MIDDLE EAST.	1

I am really glad to know that this top local high school quarterback of a few years ago, is on our Warrior football team. Earlier this year when it was announced that Larry Tuileta has returned home. I had predicted and I have not changed my mind, that Larry Tuileta will give Dru Brown competition for the Warrior Starting Quarterback position. As it is right now, He could work himself into the backup roll just in case Dru Brown is injured (i hope not) or brown is not moving the offense in a game.  Larry Tuileta will be the starting Warrior quarterback this year...maybe not the opening game against USMASS in three weeks.	0
'Misspoken'...because we have a bought off, little potato, light weight government that turns a blind eye to Communist China's aggression? Crimea river already!

I don't see Uncle Sam returning Alaska to Russia or California and the other states it stole back to Mexico! Our former poor excuse of a PM used the Canadian embassy in the Ukraine as a CIA sponsored front to topple a democratically elected government and support neo nazi elements in the current government today.

But you're a ""so-called"" Journalist when you're nothing more than a propagandist. America helped get her where she ended up. Yes, she put in her effort and talent, but she didn't pay for all she got that supported that effort she put forward. We have few demands. Even our hope that she does her best, is just that ""hope"", not a demand. If we demand that those that claim to represent this country carry that responsibility to heart, they would show respect which includes simple stuff such as behaving and remaining within the law of the host country and not wreck bathrooms, but also to please show honor and respect during all duties and ceremonies. If that's too much, then the work she put into it WILL be overshadowed her stupidity as well those that chose to vandalize and lie about it."	1

Women don't make good leaders. Ask anyone if they would rather work for a women or man, even women will answer with a man. Women get too petty and personal, too emotional about issues. That is not a suprise because geneticly they are programmed to mother hens. If you need a leader to nag and mollycoddle you have found the right one. - Feminism has oppressed women's sexuality. You can see armies of single women in TO, lonely, dispondent and depressed. They have told women to reject men, to reject sex. That they don't need a man to be happy. Maybe they figure men need women more and therefore men will do anything a women asks to get sex. Maybe they are right sometimes. Oppressing sexuality leads to more disfunction and women have been told not to have sex, wait to marriage. We are see the work of a Christian society and the disfuction it produces.	1

We all know, right or wrong, that women who dress in certain ways are going to attract more attention, right or wrong, that is the way it is. A woman who wants to avoid UNWANTED attention could dress differently if she chose to, to avoid unwanted it. Attention can be a good thing or a bad thing, some women use attention in business to gain an upper hand, much the same way a person uses a ""power tie"". Any of us who are married probably have wives who do NOT want attention and probably dress in a way as to discourage it.

Why are you just talking about Colorado? Who cares about just 1 state when talking about a national issue? And that law in Colorado only changed like 3 years ago...before then, no ID was required for any private sales/gifting of guns to another person. And, honestly, im not a gun owner or user, so I cant really speak much on that topic - however, I would assume there are a good chunk of gun advocates that believe their rights were infringed upon when that law was implemented. And my argument for them would be the EXACT SAME as it is for voting - in that I AGREE with the requirement/law to show an ID, but they also need to implement programs to help those who dont hvae an ID, to get one. We are talking about constitutional rights vs. State Laws. If the State is going to implement a law that goes against the requirements in the constitution, then they should be forced to implement programs that help people obtain what they need to be in compliance.	0

"Truth does not change, but our capacity to grasp what the Holy Spirit is saying increases over time, as our minds and knowledge develop. Imagine yourself, for instance, having to convey to St. Peter the idea of heat to make coffee in the morning comes from a plug in your wall through a cord to your coffee maker. The Holy Spirit has essentially the same problem in trying to convey to us the marvellous and mysterious relationship that exists between us and the Divine. Just as parents adopt various appropriate ""half-truths"" to explain mysterious truths to children, so to the Holy Spirit must adapt what she is revealing to our capacity to understand. The four fundamental shifts in philosophy mentioned previously through 3500 years of revelation are profound shifts in human horizon, human vision of reality. How our ancestors expressed what this understood the Spirit to be saying and our understandings are necessarily different."	0

NATO was formed after WW2 so that U.S. can have a formal and legalized control of those parts of Europe it freed from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy conquest. NATO turned these states into American conquered land. As such these states have become vassals of the U.S., give up control of their foreign and military policies, allow basing of U.S. forces in their land. In exchange, U.S. invest in them to restore prosperity. After the end of the USSR the U.S. betrayed promise given by Reagan/Bush 1 not to extend NATO by doing precisely that. Today, U.S. installs combat forces along Russia border to start a new Cold War. It is understandable why western Europe had to do this, i.e. slave to America despite a bigger population. 7 decades long. This is the heavy price for being defeated ex-empires, now controlled by the bigger empire. But Canada does not have to do this. We was not defeated in WW2. There are no U.S. forces here. We have no military role in Europe. We must exit NATO.	0
And Frank, how about we do away with granting them world-wide accounting, and return to separate accounting like we used to have, so they can`t deduct foreign losses from their Alaska profits, as we allow them to do now!! The courts have said we don`t need to allow those overseas projects losses and write-offs against Alaska oil profits. So why does it continue? It has cost us billions in value along with their flagrant repetitive cheating of the state out of taxes legally owed under previous faulty tax giveaways, crafted, like SB21, by oil interests and their employees gerrymandered illegally into in the legislature...

"Mr. Partido, there is an ONGOING investigation into whether Trump and his team colluded with Russia, and it is yet to be determined whether Trump obstructed justice. You make your statements of the ""good side"" of Trump as if those issues have already been determined. They have not. Are you aware that there is a special counsel, Robert Mueller, now conducting such an investigation? Also, the fact that Comey stated that Trump was not under investigation may have been true at the time in question, but you make your statement as if it has been determined that Trump was never subsequently under investigation, or that Mueller's work will not lead to such an investigation. It's not over until it's over."	0

It's clear. Canada has moved quite far right wing. Liberals are now right wing. This is a result of demonizing the NDP for decades, Liberals moving right, Conservatives moving far right. The same thing happened in the US. Democrats ignored workers and the middle class and moved to the right. Now they are all burdened by the far right (fascist?) Trump. Between the bottom 30% of the suffering population and the upper 30% of the wealthy population is the 40% of middle class. They are the vital connection between rich and poor. They are the voters who win or lose elections. They move the country left or right. If they had had the moral courage to support the suffering lower 30%, Canada would have remained slightly left-of-center, but instead they have kow-toed to the rich, pushing North America way to the right.	0

Too funny. The following comment did not match the required storyline, and was rejected as uncivil: Exhibit A regarding why you never show weakness when dealing with lunatic regimes. The South Korean talk of dialogue showed NK that their threats had worked. The South Koreans should be given a little lesson by President Orangutan: start showing some public spine, or the US will stop acting as your shield. The North Korean's military 's strength is a thousand miles wide, and almost an inch deep. Bluff, bluster and threats. And it has certainly worked well for more than a decade as they were allowed to push their nuke program, as primitive as it is, forward. But the North Korean's fear the gig may be up, with a White House occupant who is almost as looney as the Kim's. Hence they're pushing hard now.

The Jews considered going forth and populating the earth the single most important divine command, which is why homosexual behavior was a capital offense. And the Church considers the gift of life so fundamental that it excommunicates abortionists and those who facilitate abortion.

"To those who are critical: My son is a student athlete on the UAF ski team and does receive an athletic scholarship, which pays for a fraction of his tuition. He also receives academic scholarships. I pay the rest. The team provides coaching, travel expenses, and an environment in which time management, striving for excellence, community service, and team work are highly valued. The ski team does not buy his ski equipment for him. His uniforms are on loan to him from the university and returned at the end of each season. He chose to attend UAF after graduating summa cum laude from an Anchorage high school because of the educational and skiing opportunities provided in his home state. He is currently on the Dean's list in the Biology Department at UAF. He plans to stay in Alaska after graduation and contribute to our state in the medical/health field.

"The stories are quite cleverly done. Today, for instance there was this story: http://www.usatwentyfour.com/white-house-press-secretary-josh-earnest-says-men-entering-girls-locker-rooms-civil-right/ The headline makes a stark claim, that Obama's press secretary said that men being able to enter the girls locker room is a civil right. The commentators erupted in indignation, saying if a man enters a locker room with their wife or daughter they would castrate or kill him. Of course, no one thought Trump entering the pageant changing room was the same situation at all! If you look at the transcript of the press conference, there is a question about HB2 and then some blah blah from the press secretary about standing up for civil rights has been a priority of the Obama administration. He certainly never made any comment about ""men"" in general being able to do anything. To that audience, it would be just as upsetting if the headline said ""transgender"" but it pushes one step further anyway."	0

Sara, those men didn't have to go along with it but most men are cowards when it comes to defending women against the sexual harassment of other men.

Perhaps examining Zinke's take on coal taxation might be revealing of his mind set. What coal producers do is mine the coal and then sell it to a subsidiary company. They pay taxes based on that. The subsidiary company then sells the coal for export at a much higher price but the company does not have to pay any taxes on this now much more valuable coal. Obama had sought to stop this and tax the coal at a more equitable rate. Zinke reversed that. Why does this matter to us? The taxes from resource extraction are shared among a half dozen states in the west, including Colorado. It seems pretty clear that he is going to support the bottom line far more actively than the interests of the states and the people therein. I don't think this bodes well for public lands.

Many of these international agreements with INTERPOL were primarily designed towards catching your mostly garden variety common criminal crossing international borders. Since the advent of the Putin regime, Russia has morphed into a hybrid militaristic quasi mafia state headed by an imperial Russian mafia Don, Vladimir Putin, who has made mutual beneficial pacts with his inner circle of bought and paid for political lackeys and powerful business oligarchs, of which many are also close friends. What's happening in Russia today is glaringly obvious for anyone to see. Oppression of Putin's political opponents, intimidation and murders of investigative journalists, and anyone else who runs afoul of Putin's new order of doing business. Obviously INTERPOL has to update itself to meet the challenges of corrupt regimes who attempt to weaponize potential loopholes in existing international agreements in order to silence regime critics. In Browder's case, reason has prevailed.	0

The Immigration Dept. , for example, will allow an ""immediate relative"" of a U.S. citizen to become a lawful permanent resident (get a Green Card) but that ""immediate relative"" can only be a spouse, an unmarried child under 21, or a parent if the U.S. citizen is over 21 years old."	0
The 5th Amendment extends to folks outside the US? The order targets citizens of 6 nations who do not currently have visas or green cards. The court didn't like that they we all Muslim majority nations. Despite that 90% of the worlds Muslims are not affected by the order , the court's insist it is a Muslim ban. They base this on not what is in the order but on Trump's campaign rhetoric. Scalia looked at original sources to try to divine the meaning of any given part of the Constitution . The courts here are not looking for what the Constitution means. . These rulings had nothing to do with that unless you believe that there is something in these sources that extend rights to folks outside the US. Any harm done to someone in the United State seems temporary as the order is. Again- this order , as written, is no different than orders signed by Presidents of both parties.	0

I think Christy knows that is the NDP gets to govern for even a few months, there could be a movement in the party to unseat her. After all, the Liberals (and previously the Socreds) are the natural governing party in BC and it is when the leader becomes personally unpopular that their dominance is threatened. So it is in her interest to have another election asap. That way she gets rally her forces and campaign again, something she does well, all things considered. She's counting on significant policy changes (I predict there would be more) and remorse by thousands of erstwhile Liberal supporters who didn't vote or lodged a protest vote. I'm no great fan of hers but for the sake of the provincial economy I hope she's right.	0

So give rural economies a chance to survive. Rural CO is dominated by agriculture, mining, oil & gas, state & federal employees, and tourism. The first three groups provide good paying jobs but they are being regulated out of their livelihood, because urban liberals hate them for a myriad of social and environmental reasons. State & federal employees will always part of the landscape to some degree…and then there’s tourism, which is virtuous because it provides urban liberals places to vacation and nice settings for the (often international) wealthy to build trophy houses. Except tourism jobs are seasonal and don’t pay very well, the money brought in benefits a few corporations such as Vail Resorts, Inc and not the locals, employees rarely live where they work, and there are so many sick social problems such as crowding and congestion, drugs and alcohol problems, prostitution and increased crime.	0

"I partly agree with fr. Pavone's intent. If one wants to hold that a fetus is a person and abortion is murder (in a culture where 80% of the public doesn't agree), then why not shove a graphic example before that public's eyes? I'm not sure why pro lifers are horrified by what Pavrone did with this video. Some are saying it shows ""disrespect"" of life. But if they also say abortion is the most flagrant disrespect of life, how can showing an aborted fetus be disrespectful? The dead fetus finds it disrespectful? Pro lifers display cognitive dissonance: They want to say abortion is murder....but they never want to say that they want to put women in prison for that murder. They want to say women who choose abortion are ""victims"" ... but women are almost never actually coerced to choose abortion. They display graphic photos of abortions at PP centers, but when Pavrone does the same thing in a video, it's terribly wrong?"	0
"I see no ""moral equivalency"" is condemning the ""bad"" and the ""worse"". Attributing the KKK and Nazis as Trump's base is beyond ludicrous.

Hmm ... what's wrong with this picture? Seem greedy to you? It does to me. Washington wished for the Moon and got there. *Wishing* to say bye-bye to NAFTA's Chapter 19 will be equally easy, but getting there will be far harder than another Moon landing, especially when the governments of the two other participating nations agree that the sky is *not* the limit on American ""demands."" Why even negotiate with a nation that is as volatile as any other banana republic? The USA could disintegrate at any moment, owing to reasons that are all-too obvious. Why sign a trade agreement with a lame duck partner in Washington?

However, nobody thought to check if there was actually any public support for it. it took fifteen long years and a lot of replacements in both houses to get it rescinded.

But what has been the result of his international provocation? China flying nuclear bombers around Taiwan to demonstrate its commitment to ""One China"". Is this what we want... an angered world ramping up shows of force? And this is assuming Trump has a coherent strategy about China and Taiwan rather than one morning thinking, ""Hmm, I've got some developments being planned in Taiwan, let's give them a call and butter them up a bit"". If he wants to offload security and state department briefings to Pence he can do that, but he can't remain ignorant and then play in the international sandbox as his whims demand."	0

Only the little people pay taxes"". Substitute ""respect the rule of law"" for ""pay taxes"" and that pretty well sums up the imperious attitude of the Alaska Legislature ruling majority caucus.

You're right, I didn't answer your question. Didn't feel like wasting my time on every dumb aspect of your comment, so I picked only one. Trump should have done what any real leader would have done. Lay out just enough of the evidence to show that we know he did it, then demand they stop immediately, then tell him the current sanctions will not be lifted until after the 2020 election and a full analysis by our intel finds no Russian meddling in that election. And make it clear if we catch them again there will be proportional response, such as more sanctions, or freezing of assets, and possible cyber attacks that could cripple their infrastructure. The kind of relationship Trump should have come away with is one where he made it clear that we won't tolerate attacks of any kind against our democracy. How hard is that?	1

All taxes, except those that you do not pay, are regressive. Spin it any way you want but it is true. A sales tax gets everyone who spends money in Alaska in the game to help pay for government and the services it provides. You can exempt essential items which would reduce the impact on low income individuals. Further, with a little judicious buying you can minimize the tax one would pay further reducing its perceived regressivity. Not to mention a sales tax is more fair than an income tax that fewer than 50% of wage earners would pay.	0

I have really bad news for you. Men can watch children playing from any vantage point. The options are endless. Men can watch from behind a tree, while hidden behind bushes, from the privacy of their vehicle, from across the street, from a window. For that matter, so can women. Men can also watch children ride bikes or skate or walk to school. No wonder American productivity is at an all time low.....	0

Another issue that has been ignored is the unfair or inequitable treatment of homeowners and other asset owners regarding income on capital gains. In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help. These are all understandable and addressable issues.	0
"You should take note of this Hawaiian Hater. You claim to be employed by ""KS"" which I presume to be Kamehameha Schools, which you have never disputed.

Switzerland, where almost every adult male is legally REQUIRED to possess a gun.

In the past when the young moved out, they didn't go to a house, they went to an apartment, that was shared with others. Three bedrooms three room mates. Not everyone had a pension back in the day, and people managed to survive. The big difference today as opposed to earlier times, many of the young have no desire to leave a house that is probably better then they will have in a long time perhaps ever. Everyone I knew didn't live at home after school, and wouldn't dream of such a thing. Once we went off to university or college, home was just a stop over, no one went back to live there. But then again we took courses that would actually get us a judge, and would be embarrassed to have to have our parents help us after we graduated. Most of the people I went to school with never owned a house until their mid thirties.	0

"Perhaps if there were more reporters with conservative views that didn't quote Breitbart, RT, Alex Jones and Rush ad nauseam, they'd have more opportunities. Sorry, but the right has just about cornered the market on inflammatory, poorly sourced, deceptive and outright lying news. How are we to trust media that takes a obviously false narrative and runs with it for as long as it serves their purpose? I know there are examples of liberal reporters doing the same, but no where near the length and breadth of the conservative side. Luckily, there are still some conservative sites (National Review, The American Conservative) that actually strive for ""Fair and Balanced"" reporting and I encourage my fellow leftys to step out of the bubble there."	0

“Russia hacked the Democratic Party's computers AND that they interfered with the election with a planned and widespread disinformation campaign” Like they did in 2004, the Dems are complaining about what is in fact TRUE. In 2004 Swift Boat Veterans For Truth holed the traitor Kerry’s campaign at the waterline. Thereafter Dems used the pejorative ‘swift boating’ as their way of objecting to the TRUTH. Now we find that Dems are similarly exercised because of the TRUTH - - and the truth is that Podesta did indeed write the damning emails exposed not by the Russkies, but by Julian Assange. // more to follow //	1
"Much of pot is NOT ""smoked"". I've read that in Washington State and Colorado, about 45% of it is vaped (no combustion and its chemically-induced carcinogens), and about the same percentage of the remainder is in ""consumibles"" - edibles like cookies, tea, tinctures, etc. I also take issue with your claim, ""pot and booze are both mind altering"". I know that alcohol does do damage to the brain, but it also changes people's personalities - and usully not for the better. Pot is more mood altering than ""mind altering"". (We used to call it an 'attitude adjustment' - which worked perfectly as an after-work wind down.) Despite the stereotypes and myths, people can actually converse fairly cogently on pot. I know of 2 writers who wrote a best-selling business advice book on public relations that spent 9 months on Canada's best-sellers lists while on weed. Some of our best literature and favorite music was produced by people on pot. If that's ""mind-altering"", I'd say it was for the better."	0

"More honestly stated; in a post-election survey conducted by a racist, left-wing hate group, still parading itself as a legitimate human rights organization, a well-orchestrated survey of 10,000 of its life-term members, 90 percent were told to say that the climate within their brainwashing facility had somehow, someway, been negatively affected by the Trump campaign. Not surprisingly, only 80 percent of the life-term members of the hate group SLPC were instructed to imagine some non-existent anxiety and fear among every student with the exception of all the white, cracker-ass students.

This silliness in your newspaper today is what you get when you avoid the elephant in the room, which is the impact of the billions and billions of dollars of overseas money flooding in.

Frank, Fireworks are like firearms. Neither of them will ever cause a problem unless there is a careless or stupid person around. Perhaps that is what needs to be addressed. The creation of stupid people? Accidents do not just 'happen'. At some point a careless or stupid person was involved in committing a negligent, careless, arrogant or just plain stupid! Calling for a total ban on anything has little effect other than creating a society totally controlled 'for their own good'. The translation of that is a society devoid of any personal responsibility because the elite agency in charge has made everything safe, secure, warm and fuzzy so one can never even scrape their knee and get a boo boo.	1

"I went to the NOAA web site and there is a list of cases going back four years. Most of the cases if not all were ""committed "" by or for financial gain. Down in SE Alaska we have a presence by the NOAA ship, the NOAA law enforcement officers too. They have tons of great information and resources designed to educate but not the personnel to do it. At the two Sitka Whales Fests I attended NOAA had a booth with lots of ""freebies"" that I admit I helped myself to for my grandchildren. It had ""prevention"" information for boaters regarding the non-harassment of whales, information about what to do and who to call regarding injured protected mammals. It is an education issue and maybe this incident will provide the opportunity for education as you said. It really needs to be covered in school and at home but needs to be accurate information. By the way, have you studied up on Public Law 280 states ? Alaska is one of six and the Alaska Natives/American Indians were given no choice about it."	0
"Kitty's 58-member homeless taskforce, which conducted meetings for over a year, included a wide spectrum of people, including some homeless people. The only tangible results were Opportunity Village Eugene, and I believe some rest-stops. Yes, apparently we need housing, but I doubt ""newly"" built housing will ever be ""affordable"" for low income renters. Some people seem to believe that can happen, but if rents are too cheap, those projects won't pencil-out and developers will not build. I believe a better job market with better wages is the key. But in Eugene, the city doesn't seem interested in any new businesses (manufacturing) except the hi-tech industry. With all the projects the city seems bent on funding ( $25 million city hall, $6 million silent rail crossings, $48 million in URD projects, etc.) I predict more property tax measures and storm water increases. This will increase the cost of living for everybody. I'm glad I'm near retirement, or I would've left years ago."	0

Only works if you categorize those abusers as homoesexual men rather than as victims of abuse themselves. Consensual homosexuality and pederasty are two very differernt things. Equating these serves a social agenda of certain bishops who are deflecting from their own shoddy vetting, likely claiming that they were made to admit gays to seminary rather than asking candidates the very simple question, have you ever been a victim? Gay priests usually have relationships with other gay priests, not Altar boys.	0

"Your interactions with the white sector of the country have been hurtful and difficult.

And of course there are other very large cultural groups that you do not mention: the so-called ""coloured"" and the Indian population who arrived here as either slaves or indentured labour. And let's not forget the refugees from Somalia and elsewhere North who are derided by local Africans as “makwerekwere”. So yes, we certainly do need to talk about racism in all its aspects and as Ms Thlabi says: ""not all white people are racist but that does not mean that racism does not exist"" and my caveat to that is ""not all black South African people are racist but that does not mean that racism does not exist in every sector of society"" And how will you change it?"	1

your an idiot. most cases False. rare cases true. a lot of these guns these people are getting come from mexico. you really are stupid to think that every single gun has passed through a law abiding gun owner. your rare cases are people who arent felons n get the guns turn into felons people conduct back round searches because they are law abiding citizens. i really think you should do more homework before making blatant stupid ass comments. majority of these guns these felons get are stolen, or have been traded which in this case used to commit a murder, then sold for $45 in a different state. by none other then the felon himself. its not hard to go find a gun. go to ghettos in your area and start asking. you will find one real quick.	1

"I think sometimes, we miss what's laying right in front of us, as we look to find ""something bigger."" For all the media hype/spin (OMG, did Trump say THAT????, or compare president X versus president Y's response, etc...), the REAL story was not partisan politics, it was not racism, it was not sexual politics, religion or anything else. The real story in the Houston floods was that ""rednecks"" from Louisiana created a VERY long caravan of people pulling flat-bottomed boats, heading IN to Houston, to help rescue people. The real story in Las Vegas was the number of everyday people who put their own lives on the line and dove back INTO the concert venue to try to help get others out, even as a crazed madman was still shooting. Etc... The real story here is consistent: when the chips are down, people rise above racism, sexism, economic disparity and religion. Everyday people set ALL of that aside to help each other. To me, THAT's what to watch for in all of this, not the talking heads."	0

He has been black balled, but if he didn't know there would be repercussions to his stance, specifically protesting during the national anthem then he's not very smart.

The city isn't looking to develop something there, it's looking to encourage private enterprise to do it. When you think about it that's part of how the government solves the resource problem. How much revenue do you think they generate from a parking lot versus a 12 story office building? The tax income alone would be more than parking, never mind the economic benefit of driving more business in the area. Part of Alaska's problem is we've been on oil so long we forgot to diversify our state economy, now we see where it lands us when oil slumps. Taking steps to draw in more business is a good thing for the city.	0

Our home was robbed twice, the workers on our houses substituted whatever materials they could find other than the mahoghany our contract stipulated, I was held up at machete point, a second time at gun point, a third time attacked with a bat by an employee and a fourth time by a trio of thugs holding hammers. By our fourth year, I would fly my wife out of the country for any medical care and would not allow her to go to Belize City alone and would not allow her to not hold my hand.

"When Christians act with hatred and violence, we can point out that their actions are incongruous with the teachings of their founder. These animals, by contrast, are following the teachings and very example of the founder of their death cult. It's the cultural Muslims, the alleged ""moderates"", who are *not* following the teachings of Mohamed. Among cultural Muslims are atheists, secularists, and other free-thinkers. In their own countries they are persecuted, imprisoned, and killed. These are the people who western pseudo-liberals should be supporting instead of leveling the indictment of ""islamaphobia"" against anyone who's ever read a history book. Islam is a particularly repugnant form of the Abrahamic family, an ideology at odds not only with American values, but against human rights in general.

"From today's Star Advertiser ""Defective sensor may be reporting Kauai heat wave"" ""A National Weather Service technician on Kauai who was alerted to weeks of “suspicious data” coming out of Lihue Airport determined this week that the heat sensor located just off the runway was “reading a little bit high.” Officially, since June 27, high temperature records for the Garden Island have been broken (six times) or tied (eight times), but the blame might lie with malfunctioning equipment rather than climate change. “So many records in such a short period of time,” Birchard said. “With one after another from the same station, I’m a little suspicious. It’s at the point now where we’re noticing it.” “Several years ago we were noticing the same trend at Honolulu Airport,” Birchard said. “It turned out the sensor was (off) by a degree or a degree and a half. It only takes a degree or two to set records in Hawaii.”"" This is why ground based records are not reliable. Conspiracy?"	0
Trump won't give a shit about Canada. A far right President and a far left P.M. It's chalk and cheese. If NAFTA is open, it will end with a U.S. advantage. The milk lobby is already lobbying Trump's team to force us to get rid of our supply management system. Carbon taxes here; no carbon taxes in the U.S. That, immediately, puts our businesses at a disadvantage with Trudeau unlikely to respond. Combined Provincial + Federal corporate tax in Canada is approx. 27%. Trump will lower U.S. corporate tax to 15%. Another disadvantage for us. And in Ontario, we have a hapless left-wing Gov't raising hydro prices to record levels, while just over the border in the U.S., they're a fraction of the cost. Advantage US. Trump is going to eat us for lunch because we are now run by left-wing Socialist morons with no business sense who see the giant iceberg up ahead but refuse on political principal to steer the ship in any other direction. Get your life preservers on and get ready for the impact!	1
"I hope that one day a journalist (or a gay historian) will tell us the reasons that led Harvey Milk, 39, and his lover to leave New York abruptly, his hometown, immediately after the events of the riot at the Stonewall Inn in June 1969. What municipal authorities (police department) who have served on Milk that he was ""non grata"" and leave New York within 24 hours? What was the participation of Milk, lawyer, very well-known agitator from the authorities (for the defence of the rights of gays in Greater Manhattan) within three days of rioting of the Stonewall, the ONLY gay bar 'authorized' of the city and held BY the New York mafia ? (Don’t forget, this is the SAME day of Judy Garland’s New York funerals- ALL Gay Manhattan & “foreign guests Drag Queen” around the World (20 000) are in mourning of their SUPER SUPER Icon of Gay Culture and above all just of the middle of VietNam War, “enough” is “enough” !

Speaking of ignoring problems, why in the world is Lisa Murkowski supporting Donald Trump for president? That alone is disqualifying for her reelection. A crystal case of party over principle. Again.

Hi Laicus, I understand your concern; we want the will of the community to shine through in determining what is and is not acceptable behavior. That's part of why we ask humans to read and rate all of the comments, instead of using language processing algorithms to do it. (Language processing algorithms also just aren't nearly as good at determining sentiment or understanding nuance or the social rules of a given community as human beings are.) The role of our algorithms is largely to keep the voting fair and unbiased; we can't blindly trust all ratings, as humans are, well, human! Most people act in good faith most of the time, but our algorithms pool the votes and look for patterns of abuse. It's working well, so far; there is still plenty of passionate debate, without the name-calling and harassment. I hope you'll stick around and see how it goes for you! —Christa from Civil	0
Burglars have gotten more people killed that just about any other crime. Countless innocent children and spouses have been shot by family members fearful of those entering occupied dwellings. I stand by my comment: I hate burglars with a purple passion: they are in the same category as rapists as they strip people of their sense of security: they violate us in many ways. The only reason I don't support the death penalty for them is that I'm opposed to this due to the imperfection of the system. That being said, If someone shoots and kills a burglar in the act, I congratulate them and celebrate the grand occasion.	1

I meant exactly what I posted, that Civil Comments should intervene when posters make disparaging comments about the mental health issues other have to deal with. It's not enough just to delete those posts, they are quickly re-posted. Making fun of those dealing with mental trauma, questioning it, posting that they are faking, or words to that effect, it should never be tolerated. There are examples all over of those bullied and tormented by online abusers, some have taken their own lives, and to have this forum allow that sort of commentary, we now know better. The online bullies use similar tactics to other bullies, there's nothing new here, defending their right to free speech, maintaining that if some don't like their comments about mental health, then don't read them, that doesn't get it done. A show of power, Civil Comments, the Globe need to step in here and take action. It is not acceptable to make, or allow others to make, these comments. No way.	0

Good column, thanks for that. A divisive political issue to be sure, for which we can thank (among others) our catholic leaders.

You've yet to establish being transgender is a mental illness. As the clinical diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria clearly states, the issue isn't with transgenderism in general but rather potential psychological afflictions (depression, stress, etc) as a result of which and that may manifest for any number of reasons. Now substance abuse disorders are real, and the poor are more likely to suffer from these disorders. What your essentially arguing is that the poor could potentially be excluded or treated differently for the sole fact that they are more likely to have psychological issues, not that any given person does or will have such problems in the past present or future.	1

It has quite likely gone down a bit in the last 9 years, but I lift very heavy weights and am very, very, strong for a woman of any age. Why not? I went to an automotive store last week and bought a car battery. I didn't need any help lifting it into the shopping cart and then into my van. Strength means independence for older women."	0

Thank you, Mr. Magliano, for this wonderful article about these farms and workers. My heart breaks for them when I see them in the fields in extreme heat and doing back-breaking work hour after hour. I harvest my own food during the summer on a 20 acre community farm, and can usually not stay out there more than two hours in the sun, and can bend for such things as beans and spinach and strawberries for no more than 10 or 15 minutes. And we also have many vineyards near us that require very special knowledge and abilities. This work is skilled labor and should be recognized as such. Whenever I buy picture perfect berries and other fruit, I think of the workers and the skill it takes in picking to keep them that way, yet they are getting pennies for it. I also thank the NCR for publishing articles such as yours. I'm so glad to have found it this year as it very closely represents my Catholic and catholic viewpoint.	0

As this series of investigations continues with more revaluations of those with more than cursory affiliation with Russia and the campaign there will be opportunities for the Republicans to slowly build a case against Trump in an effort to put a classic Republican into office: Pence.

Says a lot when the city council, almost to a person, is introducing this Liberal Prime Minister. The spin, and I use the term loosely, is they want to open a dialogue with this Gov't. Says that their mindless voting for Reform/Conservatives hasn't served them well. The cherry on this cake is the town-hall with students this morning. It's not like the PM will be taking any tough questions but there he is.. probably sitting on a bar stool, white shirt, no tie and talking in his broken cadence.. effectively telling everyone of them they can be him.

"Now, DonInKansas, I can tell by your frequent smileys that you love Jesus so much that you could hardly open your mind to this, but it's true: Peter's use of the sword against civil authority was not clearly an act of self-defense. The soldier was under orders to make a lawful arrest, and had a duty to carry out that order. Peter, by opposing lawful civil authority, was ""living by the sword,"" i/e/. using the sword without just cause. Further, Peter was unwittingly trying to obstruct God's will for Jesus. The fact that Jesus' trial later turned out to be a kangaroo court does not alter the nature of the soldier's act or his duty. Furthermore, if Jesus had intended that Peter never again use the sword under any circumstance, would he have told Peter to put it back in its place (as he said), or instead, to throw it away?"	0
Now he's not only going to flag, he's going to sue an anonymous internet commenter for stating the obvious, that Trump is the white backlash candidate who can't stop taking swipes at people of color long enough to help PR?

Blame it on Colin Kaepernick or Steph Curry or Carmen Yulín Cruz or Jamele Hill or Kenneth Fraizer or LeBron James or the Central Park 5 or the black people who were prevented from renting Trump apartments because Trump told his supers to mark applications from black people with a 'C' for colored or... Trump's racism is a feature, not a bug. Ask the DOJ who busted him for illegal anti-black, anti-brown housing discrimination. Conservatives knew they nominated and then elected a racist.

"Dear Fr. Thomas, Thank you for writing this article. Of course, the identity of the Church's priests is a very important thing: they are first and foremost servants of God. What I can't understand, then, is why sexual orientation need be an important aspect of that priestly identity: you seem to agree, insofar as a man should not be turned away from seminary based on sexual orientation. At the same time, would the irrelevance of sexual orientation in selecting priests not also carry over into the active lives of the priests? It is perfectly irrelevant that a man is attracted sexually to this or that category of people when that man is a priest. Hence, there is no meaningful classification of ""gay priests"" or ""straight priests"", but only priests as such. What good is to announce one's ""identity"" as a ""gay priest"" if that is irrelevant to his duties as a servant of God? That only exacerbates issues through the prism of identity politics and needless sensation."	0

"I have visited a few different Trappist monasteries especially St. Benedict's Monastery, in Snowmass CO. for over thirty years. Every one of them I hear silence in their monastery ground. One beautiful February crisp cold sunny day I walked to the monastery and saw this saintly abbot Joseph was chipping the ice on the cement steps. I stopped to say hello, and for a few seconds it was Jesus who was looking at me. When I met with Fr. Keating, I felt God's presence because he was in the presence of God. One time I was having a private retreat at the New Melleray abbey in Dubuque, IA and had a car trouble. I met this monk who fixes the monastery cars and explained what is happening with my car. And I heard silence of this mechanical monk. I will never forget him.

One incarceration for normal sane people would be enough to deter them from committing anymore crime(s).

So, we create a crap shoot lottery to fund education? Along with closing 1-2 Pioneer Homes (to save money) and throwing seniors out on the street, if I as I suspect many have no place else to go? All to protect the wealthy from paying into a balanced an progressive tax plan? Is this truly the kind of state we as a collective wish to create? How much lower can our Republican lead Senate drop to? I have no kids to educate nor do I have any family or anyone I know living in a Pioneer Home (so I have no stake in this), but I do know that I am willing to pay into a progressive income and/or sales tax within a balanced plan to insure that seniors are housed and that your kids are educated.

There is no doubt that John A. MacDonald was one of the architects of the cultural genocide policy implemented in Canada. What I find incredulous however, is the ETFO's complete lack of self-awareness regarding the role education has played in this cultural holocaust. Canadian educational policy and practice have been integral to the destruction and decimation of Indigenous culture. Historically, it has been educators who were responsible for implementing and advancing the cultural genocide advocated by John A. MacDonald through educational policy and practice steeped in racism and oppression. Teachers and teacher organizations are as culpable as John A. MacDonald for the terrible injustices that have been wrought upon the Indigenous people(s) in Canada. I would suggest that educators and educational organizations such as the ETFO begin to take responsibility for their own part in Canada's history of cultural genocide.	0

"Part 1 Marty, I suggest there are three usages of the term ""natural law"" in Catholic circles, each representing entirely different meanings, three distinct concepts. (1) The first (and most prevalent) essentially replaces argument and reasons for a moral conclusion, with an unsupported appeal to authority. Those who use it this way often can name magisterial pronouncements proclaiming the conclusions, but are virtually never able to point to serious, sustained, published, full arguments that make the academic case behind the magisterial position; and sometimes they are not even able to specify the truncated rationale presented in the magisterial documents themselves. This usage is arguably “dishonest” in as much as the term “natural law” is employed as if that were in and of itself an argument for a moral conclusion."	0
I love riding the train. But we have structured transportation alternatives, e.g. car, airplane, bus, with such massive subsidies that trains, except in specific locations, cannot compete. Those who give mouth to concerns about global warming would be totally upset if highway subsidies and such were reduced to the point where auto drivers paid the total cost and thus be motivated to use mass transit. As it is, except on the east coast, the trains do not carry enough passengers to be making significant impact on transportation.	0

"We have a citizen part time legislature. This is what the people have chosen. The people voted they want the legislature to convene for 90 days. Of course, that usually means an extended session. We don't pay legislators enough to not keep their careers in tact. They must continue to be employed or self employed. Alaska is no more likely to be corrupted then any State. This ""expert"" doesn't like the legislative priorities so he wants to claim corruption. He wants to stifle free speech and participation of others he does not agree with. The Supreme Court has already said people have a constitutional protected right to donate to any person or cause they believe in. Limits on a person's ability to donate is stifling free speech."	0
Legislators from both parties do it all the time. If they stuck to their guns with the local issues the same way they do on national issues, they would quickly be voted out of office.

Obama on reading/writing: For me, particularly at that time, writing was the way I sorted through a lot of crosscurrents in my life — race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole. 45 on reading: ..what books are on your nightstand? Well, you can see some of them over there. You can see some of them right over here. This is one that I just.. This is one. It’s very good. ... I like a lot of books. I like reading books. I don’t have time to read very much now in terms of the books, but I like reading them.	0

Sorry, that dog don`t bark my friend. Ever heard of a fellow named Steve Jobs? Iphones ring a bell?. That testimony was over four or five hours or more with an evening committee meeting to accommodate everybody who might be urged to vote in a call, or to email a position to the committee`s email. The committee chair, which switched between Seaton and Foster waited until every single person who had signed up, during extended sign-up times, was reached and counted and given ample time to speak.

I quit watching any late nite tv and SNL when it became open season on President Trump and his family. The comments made are not funny and tend to be crude to the point that I'm surprised they get past the censors. If the poor losers would accept reality and try to make things better instead of encouraging hate and discontent maybe our country could begin healing. And I might start watching late nite tv again. Also, I keep hearing about what a good Catholic that Colbert is. How does he reconcile his actions with Christ's teachings?	0

"Oh sure, our crosswalks are a real joy to use. Two days ago I had a motorist fail to see me in my bright orange ANSI class 3 jacket while I crossed in a crosswalk with the pedestrian signal mid-day. His excuse for nearly running me and my partner down? ""I couldn't see you because of all the stickers on my windshield."" Not to be outdone, an hour later a woman nearly ran us over twice at the same intersection. Both times we were in the marked crosswalk with the right of way. Also, three days ago at the nearest crosswalk to the incident in this article I witnessed two motorists nearly collide as one turned right and the other turned left. Had there been a pedestrian in the crosswalk it was pretty clear that neither of them would have seen him since they couldn't even see large vehicles. I believe that many people choose to cross mid-block because of the unlawful dangerous behavior of our motorists. You only have to be nearly killed in a crosswalk once to get the message."	0

Hi SirJohn I know it is difficult for you to square facts but please do so with this one: In the USA right-wing extremists committed 74 percent of the 372 politically motivated murders recorded between 2007 and 2016.

LesterP, There weren't many people at the rally in Nashville, the heart of Trump country. The floor of the arena was crowded, but there weren't many people in the first level of seats, and nobody in the second level. The crowd was way below what Trump was getting during his campaign. It reflects Trump's drop in favorability in the polls.	0
Yes. It seems that Trump's team knows Congress will be unlikely to let the U.S. exit NAFTA because Congress members are getting a lot of pressure from constituents about the negative effects exiting NAFTA would bring. The Trump plan looks to be to keep heaping on more, and more, ridiculous demands in the hope Canada and Mexico will pull the plug. Then there would be no reason for the U.S. Congress to agree to exit NAFTA.	0
I am interested if that support by this legal group includes First Nations asking for a moratorium on immigration until the issues are fully addressed to ensure that their rights aren't further diluted by the variety of interest created in a post-national high immigration level state. For example, many refugees receive far higher consideration and benefits than our own first nations. Or does that disrupt the narrative?	0

A great many people around the world don't like Israel. They don't like how it came into being, they don't like how it treats the displaced Palestinians and I especially don't like how it interferes continually with American politics. The Russians are no threat to our elections compared to Israel which has a massive influence and works tirelessly to direct our elections each and every cycle. Many highly placed government officials are dual Israel/America citizens and that is about as bad as it can get. Who do they serve, Israel or America? I know who I think takes top priority. I hope America joins the boycott of anything Israel soon but I am not holding my breath. We will probably give them even more billions in military aid instead.	0

Right. How about the attackers that are very well at avoiding attribution? It certainly exists and there's always someone better than the last. Doubting that hacking never happened becomes difficult, but certainly not out of the realm of reality. When you couple that statement with zero evidence to even arrest an individual let alone try in a court of law, reasonable doubt is not there. Like I said I'm unsure either way but the rule of law means I have to presume innocence as there is no evidence of guilt, at least that you or I or any other commenter has seen. Certainly the media has not seen it either, but with the non stop articles on it you'd assume a jury is out for deliberation already with a shoe-in guilty verdict. Once again show me a shred of evidence. This ties into Darcy comment further down why trump doesn't comment. Simple, because he is not in court and doesn't need to. In my lifetime I've seen government get it wrong far more than they get it right.	0
This is the first step to merging with the Wildrose and creating a new, big tent, moderate conservative party. The NDP are an accident and a merge will ensure they are gone for a generation or longer.  I moved to Alberta because it didn't have NDP/ high tax/ loser type mentality. It will be great to get Alberta back on its feet and prospering again. I think Alberta hardcore -NDP types should move to another province so that Canadians who want prosperity can work hard and achieve it. They shouldn't have to move to the US to get this. There are already lots of high tax, low opportunity provinces they can move too. It is unfair they are trying to turn Alberta into one as well.	0
Natives shouldn't be allowed to manage anything beyond what they own. They've been given enough. But their never happy with that. Oh no, someone came and took your land.

To all of you women marching against Trump I have a question for you. What about the killing of Muslim women by a horrible patriarchal middle eastern religion and society??? Women and girls are rocked, tortured, mutilated, raped, and burnt. And you are protesting against TRUMP!!!! WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IS YOUR PROBLEM!!!!! Why aren't you rioting for Muslim women? If you are so concerned (which we know you are not) why aren't you rioting for them? Again! What have you done to save Muslim women from death by Husband or men? The real question is Why don't you focus on more important things like saving Muslim women's lives Or maybe the idea doesn't fit on your Facebook page with your Madonna selfie. In truth you women are the phonies - not Trump You are pathetic micro minority of women You do not represent women - you represent the jobs you and your husbands will lose under Trump. Thank god we are rid of you. To think we lived under your tyranny this long.	1

Ms. Wente's simplistic analysis of the Confederate statues issue avoids the true underlying issue, namely white supremacy.

"[Continued from above] Finally the piece that I originally included on this topic [about the 'woman priest' in a Zurich deanary] is a part of Chapter 8 ""The Hidden Women Priests"" by Marco Politi in his book POPE FRANCIS AMONG THE WOLVES [New York: Columbia University Press, 2014] pp. 90-93. This chapter is partially the story of Monika Schmid, of Effretikon, Switzerland, who is the Gemeindebeauftragte [individual placed in charge of the parish]. She studied religious pedagogy, theology at Luzern [Switz.] and Salzburg [Austria]. She was currently studying interreligious spiritual theology, based on points of contact between Christianity, Jewish mysticism, and Islam. It's the case, also, historically, that in Switzerland the parish community engages [and pays] its curate. No Church taxes---they hire, they pay and they can fire. As Politi states, at Monika's parish they only have Mass on Christmas, Easter and twice a month. For the other 250 days a year, Monika's the PRIEST."	0
"As with pretty much everything Trump says, this new policy of his--and its rationale--were pulled straight out of his you-know-what. Still, what should we expect from another feckless GOP Chicken Hawk who knows what's best for the military yet used 6 deferments to avoid serving during the Vietnam War. Trump is clearly pandering to his evangelical base. To firm up their support and the alt-right/racist groups that adore him, I predict he will next demand that all gay men and lesbians be kicked-out of the military. Then it will be women need to go. And just to assure the purity of the U.S. military once more, African-Americans and anyone not wearing a cross along with their dog tags (i.e. Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, etc.) will not be wanted anymore. The pandering by this Bloated Buffoon is beyond entertainment! I'm looking forward to the ridiculing ""tell-all"" books and TV exposes' done when he eventually slinks off into infamy."	1

Doesn't matter what they eat they MUST eat. If there are very few fish and berries aren't around and someone puts a little chicken out here clucking like a wild bird then they WILL eat them! If you're scared to walk down your road in the WILD of Alaska, in the woods, have to shoot a cub with a shotgun and a glock. Go live in the city down South.

Globally the last three years have been the warmest in recorded history, each one warmer than the previous. What else you want to know GM? No single model is going to EXACTLY nail how fast sea levels are rising because there are a bajillion moving parts in such models. But they are going to get the overall trend, more or less correct. And that's good enough. You are claiming fake science yet the computer you are using was built using the same science. You don't get to pick and choose which science to believe, GM. It's true, even if you don't believe it. So carry on with your conspiracy charade all you want, the rest of us folks who believe in science will be moving on and figure out how best to approach this problem.

You and Comey seem to conveniently forget that intent is one factor, gross negligence is the other. So you are saying that a woman who does not have the intelligence to recognize classified material and sends and receives classified material over a private, unauthorized and unsecured email server located in her home is not being grossly negligent? The law also stipulates that classified information may or may not be marked to apply to the law requiring protection of classified information. Hillary set up the private server to circumvent the FOIA and Government record keeping laws. Everything she has done with her private email server is a crime if anyone else had done so, especially if a republican had done so. I am surprised that you seem to be the only person on the left who finds that Bill Clinton's meeting with the AG privately two days before the FBI announcement as not being a problem. Almost every talking head on both sides found the meeting very problematic.	0

"There is nothing bizarre in the fact that every species of animal[fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects and mammals] has members that are [for want of a better term] 'homosexual'. This IS the resulting conclusion of many biologists studying thousands of species from around the world. Humans also belong to the 'animal' kingdom and are born this way. Humans don't select their mates the way animals do. FEELINGS are strongly involved. But they also involve biological influence. Many biologists/medical scientists believe that enzymes transferred from one parent or another to the embryo begin the process.

Friedman is wrong when he says the BDS movement is out to destroy Israel. It is exactly like the BDS movement that arose against the white supremacist government of South Africa, a government that many in this country supported, people like Reagan. But somehow the movement worked, and Nelson Mandela was freed, and South Africa instituted one person, one vote, and the apartheid homeland prisons of the Bantustan were shut down. Yes, it was the end of apartheid, but that didn't mean those who supported the effort were against South Africa. The people in favor of BDS against Israel see it as the only way to fight peacefully against the wrongs perpetuated in the occupied lands of Palestine. And yes, I do hate myself, for commenting twice on the same article. When I see others do that I wish they wouldn't, but his first comment was just wrong, the BDS people aren't out to destroy Israel, they are out to save it. Hugh Massengill, Eugene	0

"Thanks for this. No, really. Gotta keep up with the times. Good to know what people are talking about. A risk-free way of knowing stuff that's embarrassing to ask about.  I've been burned once before. It happened in 2002, after I'd been away from Canada in a 3rd world country for a year and a half. I heard the talk when I returned, and--at the risk of appearing doltish--asked a couple of people (made it worse--they were half my age!) what they were talking about when they mentioned...a ""Blackberry."" So, appreciate this G&M. Truly."	1

I can find numerous studies on this issue, but really don't need to because I can use COMMON SENSE. You believe it is good for people to take drugs - I believe it is NOT GOOD (and yes - BAD) to take drugs. Why on earth anyone would tell young people taking drugs (even legal ones) is a good thing as long as it is in moderation. That is the same thing as saying, hey you can take a little bit of Arsenic, that is good, but don't take too much. DRUGS KILL PEOPLE IN MANY WAYS, they ruing lives and cause any number of health problems. If you depend on drugs to get by (as you do), then I suppose you are not going to be able to accept this.	0
Provincial mismanagement of medicare is a scandal of waste, that has tried the patience of taxpayers in more ways than one. but the public is fed up. 16% blocked hospital beds, no mental healthcare, no pharmacare yet we are paying $2K more per year per citizens than modern countries miles ahea dof us, who already have all of these things.

Cont. If the union disagrees with any proposal, the City still has the option to approve. Often projects (in this case GPS) may have been dropped because based on union consultation the union and/or some of its members did not approve. In summary, all the hoops and loopholes in the relationship between the City and the union make Corporation Counsel's approval of Mr. Totto's request for GPS meaningless. No follow through may be the union did not approve and Corporation Counsel was not willing to do battle on the GPS request.	0

No, Pearl, it is not a bad precedent, the State's fiscal difficulties be damned. Did you not read the story at all? The man was assaulted multiple times before he drew his weapon, and warned the attacker that he was armed, and to stop said attacks. You Pearl, are what I consider a sheep, in that rather than securing your own safety by whatever means possible, you would choose to call upon law enforcement, hoping that they would arrive in time to save you from harm, or death. You WISH for a civil society, and actually, I admire you for that, but said society does not exist. There are those that shall not only hurt you, even kill you, for no reason that you can fathom, and no law enforcement agency can stop it, only react unto it.

The answers are rooted in politics and cowardice. Muslims are the biggest losers when such questions go unanswered."	1

This makes a LOT of sense - the gas line project, at today's prices and for hte vast foreseeable future, is a total WHITE ELEPHANT and needs to be killed. The project was great @ $11 N Gas, but @ today's $3??? No way. The only sensible natural gas project is to process the North Slope NG on the North Slope and export it from there, onto LNG ships built for Arctic conditions. A new LNG ship is $200 mm, so let's say we double that: a 5 ship fleet @ $400 mm each is $2 billion. Add in the same processing plant as would have been built on the Kenai, add in a VERY short pipeline into the Arctic Ocean to a mono-buoy and the project is finished, for what, $10-$15B? The State's $45 B plan was a fool's dream and needs to be killed, NOW. I applaud the senate.	1

The idea that Obama killed the middle class is incredibly ignorant and anti-Obama rhetoric based in partisan talking points of no merit.

Wait 'til China reigns in its crappy processes and starts making quality, tell your kids to learn Mandarin; this century belongs to the Chinese.	1

It's beyond bizarre to see NCR writers arguing for the de-funding of other media outlets because of a dominant bias. I don't agree with folks like Williams, but is there any prominent conservative voice that NCR gives space to in order to challenge or balance its undeniable bias? If anything, Allen is at pains to provide for many different voices & from my POV scrupulously tries to avoid the polarization that is plaguing the Church. And Winters has some childish obsession with Weigel. For nearly 3 decades during the previous 2 pontificates, NCR was the unabashed home for many papal critics who were given platforms to level their complaints about the direction of the Church; for that same organization to now complain because another media outlet provides platform for other (and new) papal critics is hypocritical.	1
This is a joke. How about if you ask a question do you support a $13 billion rail to Ala moana center.

Rail will cost at least 13 billion and I would say more like 15,000,000,000 to 20,000,000,000 if it ever makes it to Alamoana.

The researchers said: The scenarios – which include a wave of anti-globalization, a severe earthquake, steep oil price declines and a massive housing correction – are all chosen as worst-case events and are not forecast to actually occur. A commenter says: Everything they have modelled as unlikely extreme events are pretty much all guaranteed events . . . The researchers said: The agency forecast Canadian house prices would fall by 31.5 per cent over the next five years under its anti-globalization scenario as unemployment levels in Canada spiked to 15.3 per cent in five years.

Authoritarianism is not solely a Democrat or Republican issue. The State of Hawai'i is an authoritarian state. Where was the outrage when it began? Some Democrats are just upset that they are being censored and restricted like the rest of us are. They mistakenly believed that being a Democrat makes them immune but they are not which is a shock. Furthermore Ms. Mary Alice Wilhelm tried to censor Bronson Ka'ahui at the plenary session at Na'i Aupuni https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mlA2Xc2_lE I oppose federal recognition and the Akaka Bill but it's hypocritical to complain about censorship when she herself tried to censor another Hawaiian. It was other Hawaiians including those who support and oppose federal recognition who voted to let him stay. This shows how great and forgiving Kanaka Maoli are despite the hypocritical bad apples who teach Hawaiian children to be hypocrites like themselves. Aloha.	1

"This article states that there are only 59 national parks when in fact, there are over 400 National Park Service units in the United States and territories. It also mentions that Oregon only has one national park. Correction, the state of Oregon has four: 1) Crater Lake National Park 2) Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve 3) John Day Fossil Beds National Monument and 4) Lewis and Clark National Historic Park. Yes, there are only 59 park units with the name, ""national park,"" but they all fall under the U.S. Dept. of Interior, National Park Service and funded out of the same budget. I believe the author is aware of this but this article is somewhat misleading. As an Oregonian, I felt compelled to correct the number of national parks in my home state. Additionally, point out that there are more than 59 national park units but with varying names depending on designation by either congress or presidential proclamation."	0

Some day, this newspaper and the rest of the media will get it through their thick skulls that our elected representatives were not elected to serve their respective parties. This was one of several reasons why Trump was elected. Intelligent and informed voters want proper representation not a bunch of hacks doing the bidding of their party leaders. I am quite sure the AP writers of this story believe they have stirred controversy, most people who distrust the media and seek many informational sources see this piece for what it is...an attempt to stir the pot, but fails to actually inform the public in any way....which is the role of news organizations.....real journalism is dead, nor are there any real journalists.

"I agree, I would expect that any neo-Nazis punks, and other of those members of white supremacists extremist groups should be screened out, and would also fail any proper test for Canadian values. Would we really accepting people like that today, because we have no way of screening them out? How many would be applying anyway, wouldn't they already be here, or in the US? would there be no reaction if someone wore a neo-Nazi t-shirt or hat, or confederate flag, at a swearing-in ceremony, or would we just just shrug it off in the name of ""diversity""? Or maybe we have an actual chance of being able to screen those out because they aren,t playing the ""religion"" card?"	1

Peter, I had the good fortune of meeting you once - your vanity plate on the red Lotus gave it away. Like others who have commented, your writing is more a matter of human experience than cars. Electric bikes in bike lanes, winter driving in a convertible - but especially your family's relationship with the K-car, vicariously through your mother-in-law. Tremendous. And like you, my fave is unlikely - my 1998 Jeep TJ (now know as a Wrangler). Noisy, bumpy, gettin' rusty. But it's seen my two wives, assorted ex girlfriends, 4 cities, two countries, and 3 malamutes. It will be sold or scapped only when I myself am in a box. Best of luck to you.	0
I wouldn't call dividend tax credits boutique - apparently these have been under consideration as well. Don't disagree about other very narrow tax credits, though they by no means benefit solely the 1%. If middle class boutique credits are eliminated, this is counter to Trudeau's platitude 'helping the middle class by asking the 1% to pay a little bit more', but rather it is a sneaky revenue grab.	0

"""In the 1970′s and 1980′s, in particular, there developed at certain seminaries a “gay subculture”, and at these seminaries homosexual liaisons occurred among students or between students and teachers... ... the sexual corruption that entered into seminary training in the 1960′s and ’70′s did not come before the increase in sexual permissiveness that had taken hold of segments of ordained clergy, but rather resulted from men, already ordained as priests, bringing their attitude and lifestyle recently acquired back into the seminaries as teachers during a period of significant confusion in the Church. This sexual licentiousness occurred concurrently with a rising crisis of confidence among all clergy … The atmosphere of disciplinary and doctrinal defiance common to the time [60's & 70's] would have encouraged confusion among the rank and file priests, and in the deviant, set sexual behaviour afoot ...” http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2265&context=lnq"	0

I suspect it's simply increased competition higher admission standards brought on by international competition quelling access to US higher ed. That's a recipe for resentment, elitism and racism (which there is much more evidence) which some call ""nationalism"" which others refer to as ""ugly Americans"" or ""deplorables"" as one politician suggested...mentalities for an army of Putin's bots to mine the computers of millions of Angry Birther Americans.

Public funding of any large project, is usually at a finacial loss. The 300 million public Library, will cost tax paying citizens, as will the ring road, museums, parks, concert halls, and even recreation facilities. In all of these cases, only a handful benefit.

Yes, but not in the short term. Soon enough the whole house of cards is going to collapse, it is the inevitable outcome of socialism. The only possible way it can end is by the government trying to confiscate anything left of value and preventing individual freedoms of those who might oppose such moves up until it becomes a dictatorship and there is nothing left of value to steal. Once there is nothing left to steal and no one left to lend them money with real value they will try to print up their own money, but it will be worthless and no one will want it. At that point the government will do the only thing they can do: Use their military on their own people... until the military stops listening to the government, often in very short order. Those who are following Venezuela know that they are already almost at the end of that inevitable chain of events. Sadly after this chain events comes a collapse, and then a long and arduous rebuilding process. But it will get better.	0

I concede to “adjudicated” being a legitimate qualifier. I’m not sure, however, that the judicial system could handle the load.

When it comes to implements that can kill as fast as a trigger finger can twitch, I believe in erring on the side of caution. ———— Rational reform could begin by requiring Universal Background Checks on all private, as well as licensed, transfer of weapons.

Lol really. No offence but that’s an idiotic statement. I’m not looking for likes from the douches on the left/ right political side of things. You can’t honestly think this though. Our government federally and provincially across Canada works exactly like this. The more money in the more money spent. It is always, and will always be spent with little oversight, common sense, little efficiency. That’s it. You see provinces with hst taxing more that have massive debts. Obviously more money didn’t make them better money managers, quite the opposite actually. They post phony surpluses but debts are ever increasing. The problem is the way money is spent. That’s it. Bloated public sectors that’s sole obligation is to become more bloated. What bloats more then more money. Don’t be naive to think less equalization would magically turn these inept politicians to manage money any better. That includes cons, libs, and dippers. They have zero sense of money management and probably never will.	1

"Nearly all the verbal testimony submitted during the public form on Jan 23rd was about the ongoing problems in Eugene's downtown. The worst the problem becomes, the more complaints voiced during public comment, thereby more time spent. The ""process"" (public comment/input) is directly proportion to the public's dissatisfaction. Changing the process does nothing to solve the problem, it would probably only further sour the public's feelings toward the city, and give the impression the city is not interested in listening. In other words, it would be counterproductive to change the process to seemingly minimize the outrage; doing so sends the wrong message. I hope that helps."	0
So, in Belgium the highest tax bracket is a little higher than ours, and those making less than ten thousand US dollars pay no income tax. That doesn't sound much different from us. I wouldn't be in the top bracket. Would you? But the last several years I paid taxes at a higher rate than did Mitt Romney. Believe me, that hurts. Do you think that's fair? I don't, yet the Republicans in Congress want to give rich people more, huger tax breaks while cutting benefits for the so-called middle classes. Do you approve of that?	0
"Kent Mortimore, a longtime deputy DA under Doug Harcleroad, also had experience as a local TV news reporter. He certainly could have shared some insight on how to handle interviews.

A market this size has two kinds of reporters -- the naive and the content. Both require hand-holding. Otherwise, they'd be elsewhere.

"It does not state here in the article which lane the cars were in when they collided, but my guess is that it was the ""left"" lane for those traveling properly. I learned many years ago that, at night, except as needed to pass someone, always stay in the right lane on a divided highway. Drunk/drugged/confused drivers traveling in the wrong direction will normally stay in their ""right"" lane, which means that from someone traveling in the proper direction this drunk/drugged/confused driver will be in that left lane. Add that if it was drunk or drugged, they may not have had their headlights on, meaning that a person traveling in the proper direction but in the left lane would only have about one to two seconds to even see the other car coming directly at them."	0

"""Leave Black Catholics out of it."" You are shifting the meaning of the metaphor. That metaphor has nothing to do with the color of one's skin, much less one's religion. ""Brown priests"" of Nazi Germany were black-hearted to compromise the Gospel as are Imams today in the Middle East who exploit the tensions there to attack everything about the West. Nancy is just as black-hearted, making sub-textually the sins and crimes of a few intrinsic to the faith-integrity of everyone in the church. Maybe a better metaphor for Nancy would have been ""white-fanged"" to best express the center and excess of her anger. As for you -- Raymond J. Jirran, Ph.D. -- you need to go back to English 101 and attempt to acquire a literate knowledge of metaphor. A metaphor like an big onion should have successive peelings of meaning. Not one!

Now, you raise an interesting point about ""the products this firm manufacturers could have implications for national security."" Possibly. Then the federal government owes it to Canadians to quickly buy all the exciting new processes and programs this company produces--to help meet Canada's own security needs, and in so doing, stipulate that the buyer (Canada) enjoys an ""exclusivity"": no other nation can be offered the same stuff. Ottawa didn't. That we know of. But your guess about why is as good as mine; because (1) there's nothing there to compromise Canada's security or (2) the fed. govt. wouldn't know a security advantage (or disadvantage) if it tripped over it. Either is certainly possible!"	0
"Dear all--I make a six figure income and I pay a lot of taxes. I am not self-employed. I do not mind paying my taxes if everyone else pays up properly.

I am outraged that they are dodging their taxes in this way. It is high time such tax-dodges were stopped.

This type of murder-suicide has happened many, many times before, where a student super upset over being given a poor grade retaliates against their teacher and kills him. And in some cases like this one, they then follow that up with committing suicide. You cannot pass any kind of law to stop this sort of crime. I guess that if college professors like this unfortunate man were to give all of their students an A grade, then this sort of thing would never, ever happen.  But that is obviously unrealistic and impossible to do. http://laist.com/2016/06/01/ucla_shooting_victims_id.php	0

I would like to see the same survey done among the American Catholic hierarchs - ie, the American Catholic bishops, archbishops and cardinals.

"The CCC which was mostly the work of Joseph Ratzinger, is going the way of the Baltimore Catechism. It has no sense of the importance of some truths over others. Everything is presented as of equal importance. So the Trinity, the Incarnation, and guardian angels are all on the same level [BTW, I'm all in favor of guardian angels]. But they aren't the center of our faith. AND the CCC is hard to read and BORING. The CCC is not a book one would read for spiritual guidance and growth. Fr. Rohr never makes that mistake. What elements of Catholic truths are important ARE important to him, as well. His books are very readable and his books are for spiritual guidance. Secondly, you would be hard pressed for any credible Catholic group to list Richard Rohr as a heretic. What you are spreading here is nothing but orthotoxy. And it is not Catholic or even Christian. This only shows that what you read in the CCC has not made you a real Christian---but ""arrogant and intolerant...."""	1

"Wow. Talk about having your head buried in the sand. First of all, proposals have been made regarding the term ""Islamophobia"". The motions proponent responded that ""she would not water it down"".Second,the suggestion to clarify it with ""irrational fear of Muslims"" did not just miss the clarity mark, it misses the truth. There is a rational basis for fear. Take groups of 10,000 people & categorize them by religion and or race. The Muslim group is the one where you are far more likely to find a terrorist(s) than any other. And further, while factors such as low income & brutal home governments may be a factor, the terrorists and the sociopaths that recruit suicide bombers, have a direct motivation baked into the origin story of Islam: a prophet who led people in a ""struggle"" or"" Jihad"" against ""others"" seen as ""oppressors"" who encouraged, devised & executed acts of violence in its furtherance. Whatever else appears in the texts & history of Islam re peace, this is the founding exemplar"	0
Sorry, I have a different opinion, which you might appreciate if you were an experienced teacher. Although they are a necessary beginning, personality type and values alone do not make a good teacher. A person may have the best of intentions, to impart ability and love of learning, but a well-trained teacher knows how to present knowledge and problem-solving without putting down a student's natural ability. He/she knows how to say 'Lets's try a different approach, shall we?' without hurting feelings or making anyone feel 'dumb'. A trained teacher knows how to communicate with 'ordinary working people' to help them learn. It takes a certain kind of person to be a teacher, yes; but to be effective, training is needed.	0

"Actually marches supporting programs which are in jeopardy is real live ""grass roots"" democracy in action. We're not at the point of ""winning elections"" right now. We at the point of folks working to defend the ACA and funding for Family Planning. Those are ""social"" issues, but they are, in fact, both economic issues as well. If you or someone you know has had serious medical issues NOT covered by health insurance, you realize that those issues are, in fact, not just ""health"" issues, but ""economic"" issues as well. I'm guessing you know that medical debts are the #1 cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. If there is not a nationwide outpouring of grassroots support for these programs, the GOP controlled Congress, in convert with President Trump, will likely end the ACA and cut the funding for Planned Parenthood. There's a very big difference between ""whining"" and a grassroots support movement. regards, Gary"	0

"Welp. SL, wrt sexual assaults in the name of Jesus in the US and the many cover-ups thereof -- for the former I refer you to the Boston Globe, NCR, LA Times, & lots of other sources you could locate easily enough. wrt the latter, I suggest a chat w/ Benedict XVI, the late St. JPII (via prayer, perhaps?), & the USCCB. The US perpetrates campaigns of mass murder continually in the name of God, His Son and Their will, in thrall to diabolical delusion. Cf. e.g., Vietnam/Cambodia/Laos (LBJ & Nixon); Nicaragua (Reagan), El Salvador (Reagan), Guatemala (Reagan), Iran/Iraq (Reagan & Bush 43), u.s.w., to specify only some of the more egregious instances. In His Name either quite directly and brazenly, or, more often, indirectly, insidiously.

"Islamophobia is perfectly understandable, even justifiable. Why? Four reasons: 1. While many Muslims are nice people, invite 20 million to come here, and Canada will be a Muslim society with a Muslim government. Some Canadians are asking themselves: Do we want to live in a society similar to those in the Middle East? Also, long before Canada has 20 million Muslims, there will be attempts to change our society, such as demands for the introduction of Sharia law. 2. The violent conflicts between Muslim groups in the Middle East are well known. Do we want to import those conflicts into Canada? 3. Many Canadians from Europe are familiar with the history of the ""white slave trade"". Between 1600 and 1830, 2.6 million white girls and boys were kidnapped and sold in the Middle East slave markets to serve as labourers, domestics and sex slaves in harems. The Barbary pirates in North Africa sailed as far north as Ireland & Iceland to kidnap white children. (continued below)"	1

He has a harbor full on floating prison fishing vessels in Honolulu.

Feel like I just got invited to diner at AG's Chin's house and was served a baloney sandwich and a cup of tap water. I can best describe AG's Chins philosophy to human rights as ""one State, two policies"". Sinister, evil, conniving, self serving and deceptive.

Equal doesn't always mean equal. A unit of oil far exceeds the value of a unit of natural gas. Both contain 1 million BTU's yet a barrel pays us $54 and a million BTU's of natural gas pays us $3. I put my money on crude oil: Black Gold. I also put my money on Black Diamond. We'll never transport worthless natural gas profitably. We have an opportunity to harvest existing resources that Alaskans can pragmatically export. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline does a fine job pumping crude oil from the North Slope to Manuel Valdez and we have a fine pipeline that hauls another valuable store of oil from Alaska's Interior to the Port of Anchorage: Alaska Railroad. Reflecting it's value around the world, Black Diamond is a colloquial term for Coal and Alaska owns a third of the world's deposits. Our coal is the purest and cleanest on planet Earth and Eskimos have been burning this treasure for 10,000 years. Dumb old Walker is Alaska's Nixon. We bought and paid for him.

The US tested 67 nuclear devices in the Marshall Islands during a 12 year period sixty years ago. If their combined explosive power were divided evenly over that 12-year period, it would equal 1.6 Hiroshima-size explosions per day. Not surprisingly, the Marshall Islands are by far the most contaminated place in the world. The people of the Marshall Islands have been heavily impacted by the effects of radiation, experiencing very high levels of cancer, birth defects, and other illnesses and diseases. The US has a moral obligation to the people of the Marshall Islands. It has only partially fulfilled that obligation, allowing them to enter the US freely. The US federal government provides some financial support to states and territories with Marshallese migrants, but not nearly enough to cover the costs of services provided to them. Hawaii has taken a compassionate stance by covering the costs of programs such as Medicaid. That compassion should be extended to legal immigrants.	0

This story makes me wonder a number of things: First, if this land is so sacred, and the corp rules that way, this would mean the Kachemak Bay lodge would have to be closed and knocked down to put the land back in it's 'pristine condition' - RIGHT? Second, how could this 'Pristine Land' ever have been put up for sale in the first place? Why wasn't it listed as protected property never to be sold or put under specific covonents to protect it's Pristine and archaeological importance? Third, McBride is quick to point out that natives live there at one time and 100 years ago farmed fox somewhere near there. Does that really qualify it is archaeological in nature that calls for setting it aside now, and why now and not 45 years ago when he built his lodge their that charges $1,000 a night? Forth, would the new China Bay operation negatively affect the Kachemak Bay operation and might that not be the 'real' reason for his oposetion now? The list goes on but am out of charactors, sorry	0

I wondered exactly how much United Airlines can actually be responsible for? They did have the right to remove Dr. Dao but they were not responsible on how Dr. Dao was removed. That falls on the airport police who do NOT answer to United Airlines. (Many apparently believes they do.) Once law enforcement arrived at the scene, everyone else become a secondary status as it is in any situation of this nature. Obviously, United wanted that passenger removed but airport police were the ones that determined how that passenger was to be remove. People and city of Chicago will probably end up footing for all the compensations once the emotional and outrage feeling toward United are removed from the equation. Airport police were pretty stupid in the way they handled this entire affair. An more intelligent approach would have save everyone a lot of headaches but that is what you got when everyone involved, got the case of the stupid!!!	1
This is a truly amazing post. You're admitting that Trump is a liar. OK, we all know that..Then you say it's OK that he lies because he's doing it to get elected. You suggest the racist, xenophobic, homophobic, sexist, mean-spirited Donald Trump is just a facade he using to get elected. You make his possible election sound like a big, oddly shaped, heavily wrapped Christmas present. 'We don't know what's in it, but you assure us it will be really fantastic.....It will make America Great Again!!! Your post would be good for a giggle if you were kidding. Unfotunately, you're not kidding, and electing a man like Trump to be our President is hardly a laughing matter.	1

"We used to own a Xebra almost a decade ago, now we have a proper EV. It was a terrible vehicle, but hopefully it is a little bit of a different situation from Arcimoto, ZAP imported those golf carts from China and slapped their own name on it, In the mean time they promoted a series of ""fantasy"" breakthrough EVs that were just around the corner in order to make a name for themselves and pump up their stock price. Arcimoto at least made a vehicle all their own from the ground up and got this far, something at least a dozen EV startups tried and failed in the past decade. But unless it's under $10K I can't see it selling in great numbers, within the next year or so there will probably be a half-dozen EV sedans with range over 200 miles for under $40K, so you no longer need a tiny vehicle to get decent range, which was the case when Arcimoto started out."	0

The view from the other side, as a white male: My mother's father was Ukrainian, her last name is constantly mispronounced, everyone gets it wrong. For me, people think I am Chinese because of my first name, and often use my family name as my given name, Chinese people in particular seem to think I am Chinese. My name is actually an old English name that happens to also be a common family name in Chinese. It's annoying, often I just don't correct people, but I don't worry that everyone is a racist out to get me. Jerks come in all shapes, sizes and colours, and from all kinds of different backgrounds, religions and cultures. It's not because you're black, its because they're a jerk.	1

Many of these old Methodist congregations leave behind buildings more suitable for Catholic liturgy than some of the theater-shaped or circular buildings misguidedly built by Catholics in the last 50 years. Often the WASPs were in these places long before Catholics, so in some towns the Protestants have good buildings--even if their tabernacles are empty--and the Catholics have shopping mall/airport terminal stuff ill suited to participatio actuosa and sacrifice of the Mass It is too bad there isn't a trust of some sort to buy them and hold them until a diocese or religious congregation (or association of the faithful) can purchase them for use as a chapel or as a replacement for a poorly done parish church. They were built for Christian liturgical worship (however defective) and built to last. It's a shame to see them put to worldly use.	0

The puppies were adorable but I was worried about the mess puppies leave knowing I do 95% of the cleaning in our home, but he promised. About a month into it after two surgeries for cherry eye and countless arguments about poop and pee and snoring and cages I chose to Go On Strike. There was pee on the floor for three days and hubby was so angry no one was helping with the dogs. We almost got a divorce the last day the puppies were here.(seriously) He ended up giving them away to a vet in town. I ended up cleaning the pee after all.	0

"But now you are speaking about Christianity. Islam is, essentially, a summation of early Christian heresies and myth and not, necessarily, situationally. The OT has many more references to God analogously taking on traditional male and female characteristics. It was through Jesus that God revealed Himself as Father, though this is not meant as a gender indicator but as an actor in the lives of His children. This is not so for Islam, as I understand it, where, though masculine pronouns (which may have a neuter gender) are often used, the Surah I provided is, at least for those with whom I've spoken, a ""proof text"" that Allah is masculine. Primarily, though, I just think Leo is the better character for the job of delivering the line."	0

Here is an easy solution for this entire thread. Let's require a national ID card for everyone. It would show full name, citizenship status, date of birth, ADA status, and anything else we need to prove/allow. Oh yeah, it would be a picture ID also. What's more, they would be free unless replacing it due to loss. It would be the federal government's responsibility to pay for the ID card and the individual's responsibility to prove everything on it. Kind of like what we have to do in the military, whether one is active, reserve, guard, retired, dependent, and now as a Veteran. Well, the Veteran ID card I think may still be voluntary, I'm not sure. Its been a few years since mine was made.	0

Trump & his traveling clown show will do significant damage to our country. Indeed if he runs the government anything like his casinos the damage will be epic. But the basic incompetence of the circus and the man himself may in a way limit the damage. Sans my vote but not long ago we elected to our highest office someone just as unqualified and unprepared as Trump . And just like Snowbank Snooki, I don't see Trump lasting a full term. We're stuck with the most unqualified & ill-prepared man in the history of the republic because a whole bunch of conservatives threw an electoral hissy fit. But I am prepared to give Trump the same benefit of the doubt that the average conservative gave to President Obama...which is a big fat none. If a Trump presidency doesn't turn out to be an extinction level event for American Democracy, it'll only be because Trump is ousted from office in time.

. What? Still no mention of serious irregularities re Beltrami's candidacy in the AK Dispatch? http://mustreadalaska.com/vince-beltrami-shouldnt-even-be-on-the-ballot/ BELTRAMI DIDN’T TURN IN HALF THE SIGNATURES REQUIRED When Vince Beltrami filed signatures to run as an independent candidate, he came up short. He had 70 verified signatures. He needed 170. But the Division of Elections certified Beltrami anyway, ignoring state law: AS 15.25.170. Required Number of Signatures For District-Wide Office.... The Division of Elections has had a bad year for performance. It had to have one of the legislative races,... Division of Elections will not release a copy of the signatures on Beltrami’s petition,.. Walker/Mallott = inept + mismanaged + untrustworthy	0
oh save the harris absolute lies you idiot, harris having been handed a 10 bill deficit went to work on it from day one lowering the RAE deficits every year until then running 4 years of balanced books, now again as in the past answer this coward, should harris of fired say 100,000 public sector people just to ensure no debt added from day one OR was it better of him to work it down? knowing you wont answer being the alt left coward you are,, we know what harris did was great for Ontario!,, , and did it while the FED LIBERALS were downloading and cutting billions in transfer payments, OH btw Remember the over 800,000 NET PRIVATE sector FULL TIME JOBS that were created under harris?? HA HA you cant spin your way out of this loser, harris is what we are going to need again to deal with now the LIBERAL DEBT	1

"""What is it with this quaint custom of emphasizing hobbies and extracurricular pursuits ..."" Too, too logical Georgia An.

Ahhh, but my hunch is, they are important clues to the employer who posted the ad. ""Is this my kinda guy/gal?"""	0

Really, does the Trudeau government think voters are stupid? The federal debt at present is on the order of $651 BILLION. Under existing policies and assumptions, Ottawa expects to run deficits every year from now until 2051, racking up at least $900 billion in new debt. In 2016/17, interest payments on the federal debt will total $25 billion, which is more than what Ottawa plans to spend on transfers to Canadian families in the form of children benefits ($22 billion). It’s also equivalent to the federal government’s planned budgetary deficit ($25 billion). Put differently, in the absence of federal interest payments, Ottawa could wipe out its deficit this year, despite its marked increase in program spending. How can the PBO say that they expect the entire federal debt to be paid off when the Liberal government’s own forecast is to add $900 billion? Politely stated, this defies credibility.	0

Feel free to criticize Obama's policies, but here are some facts: 1) Obama didn't spend his time lashing out via Twitter at people that criticized him. 2) I have seen no proof that Obama isn't a good husband. I'd be hard-pressed to say that Trump has been a good husband. 3) Obama seems to have had an actual role in raising his kids, who seem fairly mature and pleasant (no, I'm sure they're not perfect). Compare them to Donald's 2 sons that are as big of liars as he is. 4) If you think Joe Scarborough is a liberal, you are sadly mistaken. Held a rating in the mid-90% range from the American Conservative Union while in Congress, and voted for Bill Clinton's impeachment. He was critical of Obama on his show when it was warranted. On top of that, he has been a lifelong conservative and Republican, unlike the guy you seem to worship. I guess you forgot that Trump was a big Clinton donor once upon a time.	1

That's how it is done all across Europe. Like they do in Washington at places like Anderson Island. Reserve a section at a beach, charge a nominal fee to cover cleanup and policing, and let people do what they're going to do anyways, but in a safer and controlled manner."	1
"You can't refute my arguments so you indulge in personal attacks by implying I'm a coward. I've received too many death threats in my lifetime to take that seriously.

Example, 75 MILLION native Australian marsupials, rodents, birds, reptiles and frogs disappear down feral cat gullets each NIGHT, while animal rights imbeciles like over-the-hill ""sex symbol"" Bridgette Bardot shriek and flail about Aussies' ""murdering cats."" Sorry, I want my Australian granddaughters to see king parrots, blue-tongued lizards, kookaburras, wallabies, children's pythons, echidnas, White's tree frogs and numbats somewhere other than in a picture-book of extinct Australian animals.

"Speaking as a regular Kwiaht volunteer, I want to encourage people to check out our website, indanisland.info, to find out more about the species we monitor and help protect at the island, and to join us in our volunteer work. We are out there nearly every tide that's low enough to walk out without wading (April to August) and you don't have to have special training in order to help out. Our volunteer calendar will be found on the website closer to the new season. Thanks, Mandi, for such a thorough article summing up a complex presentation. Just one thing, though: our pal ""Bertha"", who we didn't see last summer, was actually a short-spined star that would often be seen submerged in one small area of the eelgrass meadow, recognizable for the pink color of the species, which are much larger than ochre stars. The absence represents diminished species diversity in the sea stars we're seeing."	0

"Having spent a couple of years teaching and counseling in the Douglas County jail I find this Yakima program a positive force which will help some inmates get their lives back together. I remember the great support Chaplain Glen Smouse gave us back in Roseburg, and though he was not of my faith I always saw his work there in a positive light. As long as jails are careful not to indoctrinate inmates with a particular faith, and allow for religious services for all, including Native Americans, this should not be a concern for Liberal supporters of the First Amendment. Only the most obsessive critics of religion would prefer seeing these inmates waste their time in the dark, destructive, negative miasma of jail culture. Those who would be critical of this program for its ""religious indoctrination"" should find another way to help guide these inmates back to a productive, satisfying life. Our community, as well as the messed up young inmates, would benefit."	0

“The only job she cares about is her own,” he said at a campaign stop in Kamloops - NDP Leader John Horgan I imagine that is an overstatement but that there is more than a foundation of truth in the statement. However, if Horgan really cares about the environment, he would support such a plan regardless if it was his party or Clarke's implementing it and he would back the plan rather than attacking it (nothing to prevent him from also adopting it as his own position). Electricity runs North-South in North America, not East-West. Turn off the lights, the flow of fresh water and of Canadian oil to the Yankees and they will quickly learn about the importance of NAFTA (while the US is now a net-exporter of Oil again, many refineries have been overhauled to process Canadian heavy crude and converting to other sources is a lengthy and costly endevaour). That said, hopefully the NAFTA assault brings an end to Dairy Supply Management. A scourge if there ever was one.	0
"All Cory's constituents need to think about this: limiting the premium differential that insurers can charge older customers compared with younger ones Are you one of those who are ""older""? This part is aimed at allowing insurance companies raise your rates. Stop requiring specific health benefits This means that your basic policy can be nothing more than catastrophic coverage. Life does not always follow those restrictions, like developing a chronic health problem. Allow insurers to charge more or end coverage for people with preexisting conditions. If they charge more it is easy to make it so expensive that it effectively makes it unavailable. Any of this apply to you or your family? Cory is going to vote for this."	0

THANKS Love the humor!! The author is to be applauded for pointing out and acknowledging that there are serious problems with marijuana impaired driving. Many of us are for properly administered and controled legal marijuana .... but have concerns about the public health impact. Unfortunately he is on target with the concern that there is little available to law enforcement to determine marijuana impairment. More trained officers in the detection of the physical signs of marijuana and other drugs certainly is needed. Tests of function that are specific and sensitive to the dysfunctions caused by marijuana are needed. Marijuana impairs retinal ganglion cell function. The tunneling of vision and increases in brightness/color perception are examples of changes and dysfunction in the retina induced by marijuana. Our technology IMMAD - Impairment Measurement Marijuana and Driving tests this retinal functional impairment. IMMAD is in an objective form for law enforcement use.	0

As for TNR ""helping reduced feral cat populations"", by all means provide ONE scientific study that supports that claim. Just one. I'll wait. I've already provided an example, and a very embarrassing one, from the country where TNR was invented and has been practiced the longest. Feral populations there have DOUBLED in the half-century since the advent of TNR. It reduces euthanasia, and that's ALL it reduces. It doesn't reduce feral cat populations.

I understand this is to help. But the other side most don't realize is for some victims this could be very dangerous to just show up to this.

Trying to leave can get you badly beat up or even killed. & the shelters are the first places they will look. & 99.9% of the time they will go back because of fear, threats made of harm, & even the thought if I don't he will kill me. There needs to be places like simalar to Foster homes to have someone always with them everywhere they go because almost 100% of the time the abuser will not approach the victim if they are not alone. This way they can in a since get rehabilitation knowing there safe & can & know they can move forward. Also maybe this D. M Presentation can go to places of employment.

These PR concerts by military bands are always free, and take place all over the country. Is the Shedd being paid for use of the venue? Why isn't the concert in a public park, where I've seen similar concerts in other cities? I love your attitude: ""Here's something free, whether or not it's something you like. Win/Win...now shut up""."	0
"Becca: You make a good point about stores potentially losing customers who are turned off by having obviously fraudulent service animals running around their stores. I am sure that most store owner/managers would love to be able to do something about this problem. But, under the current ""wild west"" regulatory environment there are really no good options for businesses to deal with the problem. Businesses can ask an offender to take the animal outside. But, they risk a civil rights claim which they first of all have to epend time and money to defend, even if they are right and prevail. And, second they face the risk of making a mistake and literaly being fined or sued out of business.  Most businesses lack the expertise to deal with these situations under the current regulatory environment."	0
"It sounds like your conceptualization of real leadership is limited to insular ""deciders"", strongmen who indulge their own ""bigness"" and assumed ultimate infallibility.

The more effective model these days is the consensus builder where is team of competencies looks at options from a much wider range of perspectives and values. I know which one I prefer even if it is the other that is more likely to push ""the button"" as a last ditch self-defeating move to prevail."	0

Also, Scott Saiki is not particularly intelligent. He, the other Iolani grad japanee, that creepy Johanson and the expired Mark Takai were all cut from the same cloth, hence their tight bond--scummy, overly ambitious rats with high ambitions and zero leadership skills that nobody in power (Say, Takumi, Luke, etc.) ever trusted.

If no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast for that office in the primary, the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes will be listed on the November ballot.

Trump's campaign is collapsing because of Trump's repeated outrageous inflammatory comments and lack of self control. He himself is handing the election to the Democrats as all they have to do is play the tapes of his own statements. Statements that were not seriously challenged during the primaries, are now being easily shredded and destroyed and used against him. Accepted without question by angry whipped up Trump supporters, the ill advised childish Trump attacks, unsupported lies and gross personal exaggerations turn off and scare the general US population. His doom and gloom message is not shared by the majority, who while dismayed by political gridlock, see a generally strong America. He has completely failed to shift the primary contest strategy to one appealing to the general population, and he alone is to blame.	0

Of course people now realize the media has created fake articles like they always do against all Republicans. Up until 3 weeks before the election they were no accusations against Trump Now, there are 17. Amazing isn't it?

Transport Canada has several inspectors who haven't touched an airplane in more than 5 years. Their own rules for delegation of authority state that their pilot inspectors must be current and qualified to act as inspectors. This regulatory change pencil-whips their own regulatory violation, that's why they've done it. It also saves them a lot of money, but in doing so, this allows other pilots who rarely fly to keep current without actually flying an airplane. Unless you are a pilot you can't begin to understand how foolish that is.	1

Totally agree with David B. That is the beauty of modern theatre- explorations of different identities for different roles can make many plays thoughtfully enlightening. One thing I have noticed over the last few years in the reviews of J Kelly Nestruck (a white straight UK male -if we are going this route) is an almost obsession with the ethnic or racial breakdowns of each production he reviews as if theatre (of all areas) has an machiavellian agenda on promoting the Alt Right. I remember one review he had with a British director last year I believe, and the one question he asked was why the actors in the play did not reflect the breakdown of the population and the director just sighed and walked away. I feel sorry for any current directors because in this world they will never get it right. But kudos for still trying to bring the public good thoughtful theatre in this era of budgetary restraint.	0

""Mudd, who had previously slammed the Trump transition effort as a “clown show,” is the latest former agency bigwig to openly criticize the president’s speech. ""On Saturday, former CIA Director John Brennan said he was 'deeply saddened and angered' by Trump’s 'despicable display of self-aggrandizement' and that the president “should be ashamed of himself.” Trump supporters can defend themselves all the want as not being ""deplorables,"" but no one can deny that Trump himself is about as deplorable as you can imagine.

"Hard to believe these actresses thought they were not going to be sexually harassed. This kind of casting couch culture has been ingrained in Hollywood culture every since it was created.

Nice to bribe your kid in by monetary donations like Joseph P. Kennedy did. Did you see how the female winners of Academy Awards were so gushing with kudos to Weistein even though they were raped by this hairy repulsive schmuck?

No, they're not. The institutions referenced in your comment are long gone.

What replaced them, and what exists now, are institutions that are mostly a swamp of corruption and incompetence. They're too corrupt to be repaired. The best thing to do is what is Trump is doing: draining the swamp and building new institutions in their place. It's not only in the US though, the kind of institutional rot created by neoLiberals is also in Canada, the UK, France, etc... The only solution is Trump-style populism.	0

"Trump was completely out his league. This wasn't about getting a good price on land, greasing the local zoning authority, screwing over the local subcontractors, and approving his name in lights. This was about Superpower hegemony, ally relations, military strategy, global and US economic stability, all in the context of human species existential implications, as well as isolated lives in South Korea, Japan and China, as well as NK. He thought he could bully and bluff all those factors, and put on the show of those two things looking for applause. Totally out of his league. I also blame his staff for failing to stop him. The ""generals"" are showing their limitations. They like the big body stuff. It's stupid in this day and age, and absolutely moronic in that situation. Why do you think FOUR Presidents before Trump never went anywhere near that approach? Answer: To avoid this outcome."	1
It was wrong for the judge to disregard the ballots voted for the actual candidates, thus depriving the voters of their lawful choice. That should never be the decision. The law requires that a court follow the intent of the voters, and the disqualified voters intended to vote for one or the other actual candidate. It shouldn't matter that these voters also marked another ballot that had no candidates on it.	0

He would do what he had to do, keep it to himself, and go become successful in his new job. Women demand that we let them in to everything and let them try everything out. Then, they complain when they have to meet the requirements of that job, and always cry that it is unfair and sexist. They do the same thing in the military, and fire departments, and on ambulances! They want the glory, but don't want to do the initial hard work to earn it. Part of that, is going through pre-employment requirements, one of which, is a physical exam. ""Invasive"" or not, it is a medical exam. Gals, you know what you're in for. No one is forcing you to take the job, no one forced you to go to the doctor.

"You're pig wrassling, and that gets you in the mud, on their level, and they are comfortable there. When the majority realizes that, perhaps there can be a solution. ""Free"", as a material value, service value, means it is worth nothing. No monetary value. As such, ""free"" stuff, things, are disposable, easily discarded, and are easily replaced. But if you have to actually work to get what you want, in fact buying it with your own return for labor, the material or service has incurred value, and is respected as such. That is why people get so damned mad when something is stolen from them. They are invested. But ""free"" stuff is worthless, and it is a shame so much taxpayer earned money, given or taken by government, is then given ""free"" to people who are not in any way interested in being invested by labor or effort in acquiring that material or service. They feel entitled to sleep, pee, where they want, in ""freedom."" Suckers work and pay taxes."	1

"Yes. President Putin aims to: 1. Engineer the fragmentation of the European Union because a group of competing small nations is much easier to manipulate than a united bloc of nations. 2. Break up NATO, because that would eliminate all coherent military response to Russia's acquisition of a ring of buffer states. 3. Destroy the cooperation between international intelligence agencies in order to give Russia's intelligence community free reign. 4. Ham-string every intelligence and federal police agency in the USA so that Russia can continue to operate in the USA without significant opposition.

I see exactly why violence in Chicago, IL, Berkeley, CA, Charlottesville, etc. is promoted by the Democratic Party. Violence is never the answer. Never. Some nitwits marched to espouse their moronic vitriol. Tragically, that's their right. Just like 1M other groups I don't agree with. The ""state sponsored riot"" was simply to leverage the DNC's ""Resistance"". The DNC continues to decry all the GOP as vile racists and anyone who voted for the POTUS as an equal racist.

mandering, I'm not clear on your argument. In the US class distinctions and divisions are much clearer. In Canada our leaders hide the class war against the working class. You see, folks who supported Hillary and the Democrats are middle class who are prospering. Folks who supported Trump are working class who are not prospering. Many were part of the middle class when they had manufacturing jobs, but have fallen out of the middle class into the working class. The establishment politicians and economic leaders need the middle class to vote for them. They do not wage war against the middle class; on the contrary they get lots of tax breaks (See British Columbia). Trudeau never even mentions the working class. They don't vote as often as the middle class. They are smaller in number. They have much less clout. They don't count for much. They are vulnerable. That's why leaders get the middle class to dislike the working class, rather than directing their anger at the leaders.	0

I don't have a problem with timber harvest. Actually, I owe a debt of gratitude to the timber companies for allowing me to enjoy so much time riding my bikes on their roads; I'm well aware that this access only exists because they make money harvesting the trees, many of which are on BLM land. That said, the O&C Act clearly mandates the protection of watersheds. It doesn't mandate large timber harvests, only sustainable harvests. Taking less than the maximum board feet is sustainable; taking more than that at any time would not be. Creating another boom-bust cycle is great for capitalists, but just happens to be explicitly prohibited by the O&C Act.	0

"I think it's very sad that the #1 topic of women's health is abortion! All of you who are so much in favor of it being federally funded have done nothing other than fall for the Dems favorite line, like lemmings. Considering the percentage of women that get abortions, then how many women are not getting pregnant, and those who are under age, those past child bearing years, etc, etc, etc, the population that is actually in the ""need of abortion "" is very, very small, yet it completely dominates the women's health discussion. Those who feel the feds should finance abortions simply are refusing to listen to the vast majority who feel PP should be self-funded, instead of relying on federal dollars."	0

"You are ignorant, Bill. Niggardly is a middle English word that means ""miserly"" or ""lacking in generosity"", and predates the ""N-word"" by centuries. The two words aren't related. Today you posted that you don't know what radon is, yet you continue to challenge the science of climate modelling as though you knew any science, which you obviously don't. You don't know science even at a high school level. Now, out of ignorance, you accuse me of using a racist word which has nothing to do with race. You do that out of pure ignorance. You are completely ignorant of the law. You insist that undocumented Mexicans (that's what we are talking about here) are not only criminals, which they are not; you insist that they are racists, robbers and murderers. You said so plainly.

The pages which were 'found' show a loss for Trump in one year, how much is not clear since an accountant added some digits (good story, but fishy). They could be a smoke screen to take some heat off the demand for his tax returns. The fact remains he refuses to release any official returns, showing there are things he wants to keep from us. He's counting on winning, and never having to reveal his tax information.	0
"(cont) Mr. Trump is ""what he is"" and that's exactly what he's been all his life. Change?

"Hi Heckler, could you identify a few of those anti-Trump barbs? After all, Trump is the President of the United States so anything he says can be considered news. Certainly, there are journalists who slant their stories, but this one seems to be relaying the facts of the story, with mostly a he-said, she-said approach. The Russian paragraph at the end might come close but since the main story is about the dialogue between two leaders of different countries, the possible (""reportedly"") disclosure of sensitive information seems pertinent."	0

What I've written, out of respect for several people on this site, is nothing like the real antipathy I feel for Trump. There are many people of equal or greater wealth than Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's vanity is absurd when looking at people like Gates, Buffet, Hemingway, or the accomplishment of women who have overcome bias to excel in education, the arts, motherhood and industry. I'll celebrate the 95 year old matriarch still guiding her grandchildren to a good life, thank you. How about the pastor or counselor who faces great emotional pain every single day and does so in private?  Trump expects worship, he'll get none from me. It's my opinion. I don't like the man and it has little to do with his wealth. I've met braggers and bullies my whole life, as you the reader have. The fact that Trump wears a thousand dollar suit doesn't hide his sociopathic behavior. It's an opinion. everybody has one. lol	1

I am aware of the good and bad views put forward by Margaret Sanger, but I am not sure how that is relevant today or to this topic.

"Everyone is aware Trump has the right to say things such as of a female journalist, ""there was blood coming out of her wherever"" or his reference to Clinton's visit to the restroom during the debates as ""too disgusting"" or when he said about Latinos ""they're rapists,"" they are simply questioning his judgement and fitness for the highest office in the nation due to his willingness to defame and denigrate entire groups of his fellow citizens based on their ethnicity, religion or sex for the purpose of gaining votes. There are de jure and de facto limits to free speech: you can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater without risking arrest and you can't call someone ""nigg*r"" or ""c*unt"" without risking injury in many cases. Trump won't be arrested of course, he'll just be put out to some pasture where hideous, old, shriveled, small-handed tycoons belong. He's promised not to show his face again after losing.

Ah yes, I remember now: You equate kindness to animals with racism. I believe you've made comments in the past to the effect that those outraged at acts of cruelty to animals are necessarily racist. You're too smart to have that be anything other than a deliberate fallacy, so I can only assume you hope turn this and other conversations into a conversation about race. I think the argument goes something like, Only privileged white people have the luxury to concern themselves with the well-being of animals, and because they do they're racist and guilty of genocide because they SHOULD be devoting all of their time to tackling the only important issue---race awareness and racial injustice. I don't necessarily agree with Ms Kretzler; I'm just saying you missed her points. Now I remember why.

Good question, Brad12, why lie? This is my take on it: George Papadopoulos was a low-level and inexperienced foreign policy advisor member of Trump’s Campaign who was trying to make himself more important than he really was by trying to set up meetings with Russians to obtain dirt on Hillary. I believe he was unaware that meeting with Russians or politically-connected people from any country is not illegal, but he may have believed so or was led to believe so when questioned by the FBI, and tried to cover his tracks by providing false statements. It makes me wonder if he had a lawyer present during the questioning.	0
Has Harper been out of power for a matter of months, less than a year? Prime Ministers and Presidents don't get credit for what happens as of the day they take office.

Contrary to the popular accusation, we white people really do want reconciliation.. White Canadians want to come to a finalization of these grievances so we can all move on. Native and aboriginal leaders actively try to prevent it from happening by moving the goalposts with ever-spiralling demands for more money for things that nobody today is responsible, while they refuse to admit the many terrible things natives have done to each other. Reconciliation would end the lucrative white man guilt industry and that will never happen. Reconciliation is just a big word that sounds noble, but means nothing. it is not the money per se we are upset about, but the entrenched stagnation.	0

It is too bad people like you are so ignorant of history. Slavery in fact was abolished in Upper Canada shortly after the colony was created (Impetus was that a slave-holder beat his slave to death). People who had slaves were allowed to keep them. But the children were free. So slavery as an 'institution' was never very widespread and withered away within a generation. Further, slavery was abolished everywhere in the British Empire in the 1830's. Of course racism did exist in Canada, along with 'elites' (Family Compact) looking down on the less fortunate. (Probably the most abused group at the time would have been the Irish.) Isn't great, though, to be living today and being able to look down on all those evil people living 200 years ago?	1

"My cat, which I adopted last year when he was somewhere between 7 and 11, was declawed and appears to have not suffered any ill-effects from the procedure. I am told, however, that many cats never are the same again. My little guy has had a rough life - he lost one eye 5 years ago and had all his teeth extracted on Friday before I adopted him on Monday a little over a year ago. Nonetheless, he is the sweetest, most trusting guy in the world. I would totally support a ban on declawing. I almost didn't adopt Phillip because he was declawed and I had heard about problems declaws cats can have, but then I thought, ""It wasn't his fault that some jerk had him declawed. Give him a chance."" I'm glad I did!"	1

"We're not used to it - but the Liberals this time were not ""the government in waiting"".

None of that afflicted Harper's Conservatives. And for all the newbie mistakes the Liberals are making - they are not the crass political operatives many Harper Conservatives were/are. So the Libs are muddling more than anyone expected or maybe, likes. But to say they are ""as viciously partisan as the Tories"" is ridiculous. First because Harper is not a Tory and secondly because Harper viciously attacked every new Lib leader in public, in the House, Senate and in Con friendly mass media as we have never seen before. If Trudeau is equal in vicious partisanship to Harper- where are the ads savaging Scheer as Harper publicly savaged Dion, Ignatieff and then Trudeau years before an election?"	0
Edge? Kinison was edgy. A generation before him, Lenny Bruce was edgy. Clay was simply a boor. There is such a thing as smart stupid -- I see it in the music of The Stooges or The Ramones, and in some of the comedy of Monty Python -- but there is also stupid stupid. That defines Clay. And to call Yiannopolous a provocateur cheapens the term. A provocateur is supposed to make you think. Milo's sub-moronic and self contradictory pronouncements might have made the cut at Breitbart but I think aside from the trolls we would all agree that's a pretty low bar. So Clay has descended from selling out the Garden to cheesy floor shows in Vegas. Milo will probably still get his book advance, since his publisher won't want the lawsuit, but once that's spent I doubt he will be able to get a gig on public access cable. Waiting tables in a flyblown formerly hip café is what his future likely holds -- and rightly so.	1

"axel53: I wasn't a Harper fan and I'm not a Trudeau fan. Harper was too remote from most people and seemed to feel that ordinary Canadians would just have to deal with the fallout associated with the kind of dehumanizing globalization he favoured. Didn't Conrad Black - hardly a bleeding heart lefty himself - describe Harper's style as that of a ""sadistic Victorian schoolmaster?"" Canadians opted for a sunnier style in 2015, which they certainly got in Trudeau. But personally I find that he comes across as a policy lightweight and a poseur, although the latter description is perhaps unfair in that it implies that his behaviour is deliberate whereas too often he seems to come across more as gormless than manipulative."	1

Strange frame in this story tends to obscure the story itself. Obviously, if these increases happened, the younger judges would benefit far greater over time because they would have a higher salary over more years. That adds up! Younger employees who work for the state have in some sectors also benefitted greatly from the market-modernized pay scales that have been put in place over the last few decades. Those adjustments have lagged in some sectors for older workers. I don't know how it is for judges. Younger state employees have lost retirement money (measured as percentage of salary replacement) relative to older workers as PERS retirement benefits have been reduced over time. But the story just doesn't seem quite accurate. Salary and benefits increases benefit younger workers over time more than they do older workers, who receive the (compounded!) benefits for far fewer years. So what's the point of pitting younger and older workers against each other anyway?	0

Unfortunately our corrupt political system is fixed on rail and will not scrap the project. As one who always opposed rail I see that the challenge now is to make the best of a bad situation, modify the plan, and stop the elevated monster at Middle Street by bringing it down to street level through town. This would be better for 5 main reasons: - elevated to Ala Moana is ugly & expensive; COMPARED to BUS TRANSFER at Middle: - inconvenient transfer at Middle takes time; - rail offers a smoother ride than bus, with roomier vehicle; - rail could be extended to UH and Waikiki eventually; - space can be found on our streets for light rail, with selective widening and upgrade of roads, such as N. King St and S. Beretania St. train plans can be modified so that the vehicles travel elevated to Middle then come down to street level and continue at street level, a technology operating with great success in hundreds of cities worldwide. This will make the best of a bad situation.	0

Many of us have mixed feelings about this. Slavery was all over the world and had been for centuries at that time and had been the practice in Africa and among Native Americans. These men are the founders of our nation and stopped slavery with the Declaration of Independence and with Lincoln's Civil war they ended the practice. Adding oh, but they had slaves is wrong. Isn't there an African American Museum in Washing DC? This is political.	0

"I am sure there are, the possibilities are endless when dealing with Athiestic mindsets, I mean we could all be living in a digital simulation and nothing is ""true"" or ""real"" and everything is suspect to validation, which includes anything physical, this is what De Grasse-Tyson says, right ?

Empty, useless prayers for the victims while those professing to know the intent and nature of the invisible ruler over all spew forth hate from the pulpits, the mosques, TV stations, and even government elected/potential officials on a daily basis.

So righteous Jerry. Guys like you talk so mighty but are really cowards who wouldn't protect their daughters. So she accepted money before. So what!

You've hit on an interesting point. Sanctification of suffering in the purposeful reenactment of a painful initiation rite will reenforce the validation of worthiness. Taken to excess, this impulse is just an act of vanity, (i.e. Pride). Bring on Vatican Council 2.1 so that we can update the meaning and practices of wholesome and fruitful self-sacrifice. These pseudo-conservatives are just laying the groundwork for their own public edification. The new Pharisees praying in public. Their ridiculous self - promoting wars only add to their illusion of indispensability. Case in point: It takes a lot more courage and character to uncover the root causes of a conflict and negotiate a useful diplomatic solution, than to blow a lot of hot air and then push buttons and pull triggers expecting a positive long term result. Of course we do have to deliver Quarterly results for the stock holders. The sufferings of Calvary will not be mocked.	0

"No doubt that Trump is a bull in a Twitter shop. Who knows what his presidency will bring. What's more fun and interesting right now is watching the folks that don't like Trump.

Despite the fact that both results were fair and square according to the rules they believe they were robbed. The US electoral system that has served the nation for so many generations is apparently now ""broken"". One example. Dem Rep John Lewis who has been re-christened Civil Rights Icon John Lewis spouts a conspiracy theory that Trump's 'russian-assisted' election isn't legitimate. Trump blasts him for the failures of many of America'r inner cities - which are majority Black and mostly run by Democrats. That fact that Lewis marched in Alabama in the '60s has nothing to do with what Trump was talking about."	0

"""How can they force you to license to a competitor? "" Sure they can. That's because a patent holder total power of license is a concept unique to America, land of free competition. Most foreign countries do not accept the concept. Note that we are talking only patent (invention), not technologies or implementation. A invention, any invention, must be available to all, at a price of course. It promotes competition. It is up to the buying of license to actually build something out of the patents, which is by no means a sure thing. Qualcomm is also accused of overcharging royalties. where royalties of its chips are based not on price of chips but on the 'value' of the end products that contain the chips. Qualcomm can define value anyway it wants. Qualcomm is accused of 'stuffing' all kinds of 'values' not connected to the chips to inflate royalties. I think Qualcomm copied a lot of nasty business practices from the heydays of an arrogant Microsoft."	0

You probably saw the news this week that the Trump Justice Department is launching a highly dubious new project targeting discrimination against white students in university admissions policies. A pretty straight-up attack on affirmative action in admissions.

Tort reform would limit claims---not make people millions of dollars when a doc makes an honest mistake . Another factor that is causing high medical costs is doctors are having to often order un-needed tests just to cover their rear ends.

Tort reform would save over 60 billion--for starters .	0

You may be able to stop globalisation by becoming more tribal and insular,(though I doubt you will be successful), but you're certainly not going to be able to stop automation any more than farm workers were able to stop tractors, or buggy makers, the automobile.

"White extremist men from both extremes of the spectrum have been going at each other on the internet for a decade and more now. Now they are taking it to the streets. While the white supremacists are scum, they are nevertheless a tiny fringe movement, as seen from the small numbers they were able to assemble for this demonstration. But they have arisen in response to the provocations of the other extreme, their mirror image, who love to gloat about the extermination of the white race, white males in particular, which they have demonized as the source of all the world's problems, to be replaced by the somehow inherently more virtuous ""brown races"", which can't come soon enough in their view. Those extremes have been yelling at each other for decades now, in print and online, and the spiralling of hate has brought us to the present state of near civil war. Both sides came ready to fight.

Try being honest, Bob. The whole idea of per diem payments is that they are a generalized reasonable amount of compensation for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses; there is no accounting and the IRS accepts these rates unless they are demonstrably unreasonable. My belief, and I was an MVP Gold for twenty years or more on State travel, is that in mid-winter, the federal rate is generous, but from May through September, it is barely if at all adequate. If you're using commercial accommodations in ANC in summer, $270 won't cover it unless you're in a flea-bag hotel. The real issue is that the Leg doesn't define travel, so legislators get to claim per diem in situations where EB employees couldn't. In the EB, less than 50 miles isn't travel. For the Leg, less than 50 miles from your home shouldn't be travel unless it requires a common carrier to travel. BTW, the EB barely uses per diem at all anymore; it's all actuals and M&IE allowances.	0

I’m sorry, much as I want to hate trump, can’t bring myself to. There is always something humorous and comical about him, his spontaneity that brings laughter in me. I start my political/News day reading the headlines in Real Clear Politics, then go from there, with an open mind and reading diverging sources. I.e. if i read the WSJ on a subject then immediately read the New York Times for the counter opinion. But this morning reading about dossiers, opioid crisis, etc, then came to this part “he may even try to save our beautiful monuments”, laughed out loud.

This is a guy who is only in cabinet because Trudeau puts race, gender and ethnicity ahead of experience and competence. He is a Somalian refugee, and you can expect him to pay very little attention to those who think we should toughen up screening or focus on higher quality immigrants at the expense of bringing in family members, including seniors. If you check his wiki entry he's a guy who puts a lot of effort into cultivating the Somalian and Muslim communities. You can expect him to be doing his best for those communities, as opposed to Canada.	0

Obama said he'd buy a Chevy Volt and cared much about the environment and race relations. We'll see whether he maintains his presidential interests and lets down his voters.	0

These angry con bots never deal in facts..... they refuse to believe in climate change despite what the earths best scientists tell them. These con bots somehow know more, truly astonishing that their minds have these blockages.... even the guy at the top misleads with his 5X comment.

I think these guys liked the smog days under Harris as it reminds them of the days when they smoked cigarettes.

It's '""too clever by half"" to think most people would follow the nuanced arguments put forth by Chell. As the majority of Americans find flag burning disgusting it's one of the reasons that many people believe liberals love the US less than they do; it's the kind of wedge issue that helped get Trump elected . Worst of all, unpopular protests will only justify and support Trump's popular increased authoritarianism in the name of ""security."" Read your history."	1
The difference this election was that white voters in the Rust Belt that voted for Obama or did not vote at all the last couple of elections, voted for Trump this time. Obama did save the auto industry and went thru hell and high water trying to convince them that he cared about them. I know quite a few white men that would never accept a female leader, much less a strong assertive woman. They have been hating Hillary for 30 years. Their wives stood by their men. Like the mother of a cop that may think the Black Lives Matter movement is a threat to their child, those Rust Belt mothers feared many things that might endanger their families, like the opiate epidemic in Appalachia that is effecting mainly rural white folks. They feared Hillary didn't care about them because she cared about minorities. In their mind, caring when it comes to minorities in general and black folks in particular, is a zero sum game. Black folks gave Hillary well over 90% of their registered vote voters.	1
Who cares about electoral reform when Canada faces all kinds of other more serious problems? With Donald Trump on a rampage and about one third of our economy at risk, who needs a divisive referendum? The idea of electoral reform is a good one, but it can wait until Trudeau's second or third terms. It's an elitist issue, people don't really care about it, and while the NDP was hoping it would save them from oblivion, who really cares about the NDP? When they made a deal with the Cons for a referendum, they blew themselves out of the water. Nobody will miss them either.	0

First of all you have judged me wrong--I don't eat white bread--only wheat as it's better for me. Second , it has taken me how many years to agree with you on something ? The republicans , starting with Murkowski , need to be taken to the wood shed . They deserve a slap down of biblical proportions . They have had all this time to get their acts together and have failed the American people .Trump called them to the White House and told them as a group the same thing. Here they have a president ready , willing , and able to sign a new health care law fixing the lie / disaster know as Obamacare and they didn't get it done. Yet. Worse than that , Murkowski has put federal money and assistance from Trump at risk by her lack of loyalty . She deserves to be stripped of key positions and excluded from meeting due to her disloyalty .That liberal Alaskan's are cheering her on for what she has done and the price Alaska will pay for it is pathetic.

"Actually, the Germans developed the first guided ballistic missile, called the V-2, which came into use in January, 1944. It contain a metric ton of high explosives, and rose to a height of 55 miles before falling to earth in a parabolic path later called ""Gravity's Rainbow"" by the writer Thomas Pynchon in a novel that hypothesized the death by suicide of the human race. After the war our government enlisted Germany's chief rocket scientist, Wernher von Braun, architect of the V-2, to design our own ballistic missiles. Those of us who grew up in the '50's remember seeing Wernher on TV explaining rockets to children on several Walt Disney science specials. He seemed like a nice guy with a noticeable German accent. George Will is right to encourage restraint in the use of nuclear weapons. If we do it, everyone will do it, and it would be ""lights out"" for the human race. Was Pynchon right? Are we riding ""the road to nowhere"" with a suicidal impulse? Is Trump dumb or vainglorious enough?"	1

"My wife works on a barely-above-minimum wage. A lot of debate around minimum wage ignore the other aspect of minimum-wage economy altogether: hours worked and hours commuted. Point is, businesses often respond to minimum wage increases by replacing full-time workers with part-time ones. Even worse, since businesses that employ minimum wage workers in the first place typically belong to the same industry, this means that entire industries reduce hours of their ""least valued"" employees, which means that in practice employees have to accept this new schedule, because they have no choice. And, yes, it often means worse service for customers - who also accept it because there is no choice. But even worse is the fact is that under this new minimum wage employees still need to commute the same amount of time, which creates a situation that for every paid hour you can spend another hour in a commute, which effectively halves your pay per hours spend on work. So everyone loses."	0

Living a LGBTQ lifestyle is sin. The Bible clearly addresses the issue. God teaches to love the sinner but hate the sin. As a result, the sin cannot be condoned by society. A LGBTQ lifestyle is not to be enabled and glorified. The individual is to be treated with respect, but societal accommodations simply enable the behavior and endanger the rest of society. Males and females do need their privacy in certain situations. LGBTQ behavior crosses the boundaries of that privacy, because it is scientifically impossible for humans to fully change sexes. Society cannot let people simply act in any manner they wish, for it will cause a slow deterioration of that society. In general, people do not like to be told what they can and cannot do. It is sad that a law like this has to be put in the books. It is sad that right is becoming wrong and wrong is becoming right. Laws forbidding marriage between the same sex and rights to privacy are far from bigotry, for It is simple consequence to sin.	1

"The problem with the Senate is that they are unelected and unaccountable. The only ""saving grace"", such as it is, is that the Senate is also useless. The Senate doesn't have the moral authority to do as you suggest but at the same time the government should try to pretend that the Senate is anything other than a useless anachronism filled with unelected and unaccountable individuals. Trudeau created this mess by trying to pretend to ""fix"" the Senate. In reality he fixed nothing, Senators are still appointed on the advice of the PM and not elected. By removing any sort of party connection the Senators are arguably even less accountable then they were before (and they weren't very accountable to begin with). But by pretending that they were a legitimate body he encouraged them to do things they had no moral authority to do."	0

We have 2 alternative universes in the US. People who love Trump and refuse to see any of his flaws, and people who see him as a childish egotist who makes them ashamed of America. The majority of people in this country hate him. That is what the opinion polls say. Some of this majority tunes in to late night TV to see him mocked and at some points seriously criticized. It is foolish to think that the late night TV ratings are a good proxy for the opinion polls. The fact is that Trump is having a difficult time staffing his administration, and many people he has hired, can't stand working with him and leave. That is not fake news and is strong evidence that he is not qualified to lead the country.	1

Sadly, too much dogma rests upon a literal interpretation of this text (which, incidentally, has much older pagan roots). Very few theologians are prepared to address it in the light of the Incarnation but follow the traditional teaching of the Fall. [I do recommend Elizabeth Johnson's book 'Quest for the Living God' (which now also has a slightly different title).] Catholics are no different from literalist Protestants when it comes to this passage - it is as if the revelation of God through the Exile (leading to Genesis chapter 1), the Restoration, and the Incarnation have never happened. Much more comfortable to be locked into these comfortable, culturally based, misogynistic norms. Until we, lay and ordained, are prepared to open our hearts and minds to the FACT that we have had it wrong since beloved Aquinas (and probably before him) - and to the Spirit who is Holy, we shall continue to flounder in this mire.	0
"The thing about any substance is, they alone aren't inharently good or bad. I like the saying ""there are no good or bad drugs, just good or bad 'relationships' with drugs"". I consider alcohol a drug. I do get your point though. Alcohol doesn't need to be glorified in advertising. It's tricky because from a business stand point, they need to advertise to help make sales. They need to be appealing to people interested in consuming alcohol. People want the drink that seems classy or fashionable. It's not fair for the vulnerable like kids and people who have bad relationships with substance abuse to have catchy ads shoved I their faces, but it also isn't fair to businesses and people that can drink/use responsibly. I don't drink because I rarely have been able to drink responsibly. I don't like beer commercials that pop up when m kids are watching a show, which usually have a a bunch of idiots parading around. Not cool."	1

At the end of the day, the economy is what Canadians vote on, or at least perception of the management of the economy, even though this is the area over which PMs’ have the least control. Under Trudeau the economy has grown faster than it has in a decade and we lead the G7 in that record, the price of oil has recovered to sustainable and historical levels, Canada is considered at full employment at today’s unemployment rates (the U.S. calculates their rate differently), housing is correcting but not crashing, deficits are coming in lower than projected. Who knows what 2019 will be like (recessions happen about every 10 years, but infrastructure spending will be ramping up to offset unemployment). If Trudeau can get a new fair NAFTA deal signed and sealed along with other trade deals (CETA, possibly TPP2) his economic record will be solid.	0
How on earth could anybody think that LNG or Site-C are economically-constructive, ethical industries? They are quite the opposite.

I don't understand why you hire a writer who hates TIFF (and himself) to cover the fest every year. The contempt Semley shows for his subject and his readers is disgusting. These articles a waste of precious newspaper space. Such a shame that Canada's largest and most prestigious paper continues to publish the work of such a loathsome jerk. He must have friends up high at The Globe. He certainly doesn't have any fans amongst your readers and we're getting sick of his nonsense. No one cares about Semley's private whining as much as the author and his journalistic navel-gazing poisons a paper with so many genuinely talented and insightful writers. I wish The Globe would hire people who actually like movies to review films and TIFF rather than continuing to employ this narcissist. I'm not alone in that opinion either. He is loathed outside of the Toronto bubble that confuses snappy self-obsession with intelligence.	1

This is hardly ""one bad season."" Rather it is the result of 4-years of trending downward due to a myriad of poor decisions both on and off the field. Yes the head coach has been on the job for 4-years! This team is HIS recruits. These are HIS coaching hires and promotions(see an OC and DC who have never held those positions during their careers). It was HIS decision to abandon HIS recruits at the QB position and instead go after quick fix, one and done graduate transfers, Two years ago they played in the National Championship Game...now they finished in LAST PLACE IN THE DIVISION.

I'm not remotely suggesting that they not get some serious time. These were truly horrific crimes perpetrated by defendants who seemed to be devoid of both conscience and humanity. But I don't think anyone would be well served by a sentence of life for all the defendants. It won't fix anything. Some may have some potential for rehabilitation. It also would mean that, since they're young, that by the time the four died in prison, they would EACH probably cost Alaska at least $2.5 million in today's dollars. How many people who are promoting life sentences for them do you think would give up a single PFD to pay for them? I also wonder if the prosecutor did their jobs in the Eagle River blackmail case? I'm reminded of the Jerry Active case where prosecutors, from A.G. Ohio Dan Sullivan on down, failed to do their jobs in prosecuting an immensely dangerous defendant for his previous crimes, nor did they back up the recommendation of the probation officer who did the pre-sentence report.	0

Justin Trudeau has enough trouble getting his head through doorways already, there is no need to inflate his defect there.

What I am not okay with is a leader of Canada who got his job because of a famous last name but who thinks he got there through some kind of intrinsic, earned substance - a man born on third base who nonetheless tells everybody he hit a triple the day he was born...	0

Sure, it's actually a left-wing liberal conspiracy. But it works the other way too for you on the right . You for example probably believe the one about Hillary giving birth to an alien baby, and the nonsense about Benghazi, not to mention the one about the cover up of her having MS. And you don't believe that Trump cheats his workers, cheats on his wife, cheats at golf, sexually assaulted women, etc. etc. etc.	1
"I said that he has a holding company. https://nelligan.ca/article/understanding-holding-companies/ ""Tax Benefits Depending on the percentage of outstanding shares held by the holding company in the operating company, the dividends paid to the holding company may be tax free. For shareholders with a high marginal tax rate, a portion of tax on dividends from taxable Canadian companies may be deferred until dividends are paid by the holding company to the shareholders. You may be able to locate the holding company in a province with a lower corporate tax rate."" ""Estate Planning Holding Companies may help with succession planning by facilitating the transfer of wealth to the next generation. Shares in an operating company can be transferred to younger family members through a holding company by way of an estate freeze, structured to cap a person's tax liability upon his or her death and transfer any future growth to family members."""	0
"""Responsibility to Protect"" is unrealistic idealism. How many army divisions does it have? How many jet aircraft does it have?

I don't always agree with Sam, but I do appreciate that he looks out for our money.

I'd easily believe that Tillerson is smarter than Donnie the Drama Queen. Donnie is just a grifter who was born with a silver spoon in his (loud) mouth, and never really had to run a company in a normal way or actually have to prove his worth - he was the guy with the money. He's so bad at business that most of Wall Street would not loan him money. Tillerson became CEO at Exxon after working his way up through the company. Sure, company politics can sometimes (or often) be arbitrary and capricious, but if someone is obviously incompetent and stupid, like Donnie, they will not last very long. Tillerson also became an Eagle Scout.	1

You can't compare the environmental impact of a damn verses a petroleum project. Well, yes you can ! That's exactly what an EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) is supposed to do. Look at 'alternatives' and decide which has the least negative impact and most positive impact. In my experience, yes a damn and reservoir have impacts on the environment, but they are miles less damaging than burning fuel, or using uranium for energy. The Great Lakes were created by glaciation damning the natural drainage and they in the long run are a great asset.	1

Sorry, Stephen, but I don't believe you. And even if this country gets rid of the Zupta scum, it's going to take a moerse lang tyd to fix it up, and a huge amount of money. These swine have officially stolen a trillion odd Rand, and I reckon it's probably two or three times that. We see it in Cape Town, where 70% of our rates are spent on 'pro-poor' initiatives, basically which means servicing the million plus economic refugees from the ANC's incompetence in the Eastern Cape. And they're still living in shacks. But at least they're getting some sort of education, unlike elsewhere. Nope, it's going to take 20 years to fix IMHO, and I frankly don't have the time to waste waiting for that.	1

Dear AmyNam, If you read closely, you will note that it was not that scurrilous rag, the Denver Post, that cruelly shoved this story about Donald Trump being a moron back in your face this morning. I admit, I was as surprised as you were to see it back in the news. But if you read the whole... Ahem, if you read the first four words of the article, you will learn that none other than President Donald J. Trump put the story back on page one. I know, I know. How do you describe that kind of behavior? Moronic, maybe?	1
Damn those Mexicans anyway. Is this Slim guy a rapist with calves the size of melons like the rest of them Mr. pew?

"A socialized ""system"" implies many parts working together - so perhaps I misunderstood that you were just referring to health care. sys·tem noun 1. a set of connected things or parts forming a complex whole, in particular.

They must be doing some thing right. Taiwan's income tax rate runs from 5% to 40% - depending on tax bracket. I am just not convinced that single payer, letting the ""State"" run health care is the best way to do anything. Just look at that huge VA Hospital sitting east of the city.

Immediately come the stupid calls for gun control, before the facts are known. There was gun control that would have prevented this sick and twisted individual from buying his guns. Unfortunately, someone in government forgot to file the proper paperwork. The man had assaulted his wife and stepchild, for which he received a dishonorable discharge, and for which he was supposed to be prevented from buying guns. Gun control failed. And the man was an atheist. Actually, he was a rabid anti-religionists and a serious mental case. He was confronted by other citizens, using their guns to force him to stop. He then took his own life and has almost certainly discovered that Hell does indeed exist.	1

Simply, the fact alone that this has been an ongoing issue which has not been brought to the public's attention until now is due to the Diagnostic Imaging personnel's desire to build a bridge between their department and the administration of the hospital, not to create dissension.  They ARE involved with care that could determine life or death, and these technologists are licensed and registered within the State of Washington and also the United States. It's time for the scrutiny to be redirected at those who are supposed to be helping them care for their patients. The people of Whidbey Island need to understand the issues at hand, and then help this department care for its community.	0
"In my opinion, yes the author may be correct that Canada does not face a direct conventional military threat, but it is important to remember the Canadian way of defence has not been based on a ""Fortress Canada"" but rather the deployment of forces in a forward defence to ensure that such threat remain away from our shores....This policy is a start, but a lot more needs to be done....the recent Senate report was perhaps more realistic of what is needed to enhance our self sufficiency in defence with less reliance on the US...."	0
"Your anger isn't at the NRA; it's at the United States Constitution. If you cannot handle the risk inherent in living in a free country, then you need to find a solution for your feelings of discomfort that doesn't involve burning the Constitution. Sadly, and predictably, I am forced to point out that this ""concern for lives"" by the anti-2A crowd is put-on outrage. Far more die by alcohol abuse and drunken driving, and yet you're not only not calling for prohibition, but you don't even want any more new restrictive alcohol laws passed. That speaks volumes about you, buddy. Bottoms up."	0

Problem is that this pig used the term on a recorded line and when people investigated why no police showed up they found out the on call pig would not respond because he thought the EMTs (do dos) were stupid for not wanting to respond to a crime scene without pig back up. So the DoDos felt unsafe without the pugs and to this day the speed bump lays brain dead and in a coma in a Seattle hospital. Now I respect the pigs, I appreciate the dodos dedicAtion to life. Do you see how society calling people names in public is kind of inappropriate and bad for the Dodo, speed bump and pig.	1

The BEST improvement IMO is in the short Middle Street tunnel going town bound as you come off the freeway!

Kid is stubborn and doesn't want to learn to read: special needs. Kid has crappy parents who don't help with homework: special needs. Kid is tired a lot because they dont go to sleep when they're told: special needs. Kid is easily distracted in class: special needs. You see where I'm going with this. My former stepdaughter was stubborn and wouldn't read, she'd guess from the pictures. She became ""special needs"". The school sent her to counselling, told us not to get a tutor, made us wait perpetually for a psych exam, yada yada. I taught the kid to read in a couple months and she now reads"	0

"The information and data sets are out there to be looked at and you can read many general reports on human based activities that are causing anthropogenic climate change. There are documentaries like ""Chasing Ice"" which shows the change in glaciers over decades. There are many factors that cause the rapid changes in climate but the most easily understood is that there is a excess of energy being stored by this planet, which is translated into heat. I would suggest reading Dr. Hansen's work ""Storms of my Grandchildren"" to get a better understanding of the factors in climate forcing, methane hydrate release (and methane then breaks down into carbon dioxide), and how aerosol dispersion by fossil fuels leads to the rapid increase in CO2 loading which is so rapid that the planet's natural feedback processes are overwhelmed."	0

That was a rather long set-up to get to the point -- another denunciation of Trump. Nothing wrong with denouncing Trump's policies, IMO, but using a long parable about mercy, charity, kindness, and (temporary) blindness to set up another attack on Trump felt like bait-and-switch.	0

"You want to know why wages stagnate? Because you have illegal immigrants that will do the work for a lot less.

Of course you don't, but don't try and blame Trump for a problem he didn't create unless he hires illegals which I doubt since that would be all over the news. Trump is an idiot, but the illegals are still illegal. The worse that can happen is some white bread lawyer will have to cut his own grass or pay someone a lot more to do it for him. People should read about Rome and its rise and fall and see the similarities between it and Canada and the US. We all want bread and circuses and free cheese, but no one wants to pay for it.

How do you know? Senators aren't in a position of authority merely by virtue of their status as Senators. R. v. Audet confirms that. This has nothing to do with whether *this* Senator was in a position of authority or trust over *this* minor. Given the circumstances of the case, it appears he *was*. He had the ability to influence or control the minor's destiny and sought to take advantage of that fact.	0
Yeah, I do not know what's happening now--but when I had two package stores, they constantly sent in minors and if you sold to them you could lose your license and at the very least you were fined astronomical amounts of money. The ABC Board (who supposedly controls liquor within this state) has jurisdiction over sales to minors--I wonder where they are in this situation. Oh yeah---they are stopping a restaurant/bar from opening in Big Lake. 5,150 people want it, and 18 people do not---bureaucracy at it's worst.	0

When a legislator like Meyers has the Corrupt Bastards Club disease, we can't very well expect people like him to know the difference when a lobbyist is slipping money into his pocket (via nights out on the town) and then he provides the tip by giving the lobbyist what he wants.

The democratic majority in Iraq is Shi-ite Muslim. They're aligned with Iran. (That 100% predictable outcome was ignored by the Bush administration when it invaded in 2003.) So given that the USA and its Gulf allies are deeply hostile to Iran, how will they counter Iran's influence over the government of Iraq? By tacitly supporting Sunni Muslim extremism in Iraq, the USA and its allies have a powerful counter to the influence Iran has with the Shi-ite Muslim majority. Hence, the fall of Islamic State will not bring the end of that extremism. It's just too useful a tool for the US to discard. Islamic State may not continue, but Sunni Muslim extremism in the region will.	0

If we are starting an 11,700 year natural cycle and temps have gone up about 1.5 degrees in 100 years, then at that rate they will go up an average of 15 degrees in a thousand years. Projecting further, that would be 150 degrees until about the end of the so called current warming cycle. We're doomed! Of course the problem is that the rate of temperature increase is about a hundred times faster than what has naturally occurred in the past. Oh, and Dale also does not mention that our 6% of the world's population consumes 20% of the world's energy (with equal CO2 effects) or that China is engaged in the largest deployment of solar energy systems in the world. At least one thing is right: Climate change deniers have morphed to acceptance of the fact. Now they might start to think how over 7 billion people are making an impact on the climate.	0

You are absolutely right Utilitas. I have been more than a bit angry about these kinds of duplicitous situations myself. The treatment of Father Hall by his fellow priests is despicable, but I saw the exact same thing happen to a priest friend of mine after he was removed from a teaching position at a Catholic college for being gay. Twenty five years down the drain and only a handful of his fellow priests and less than that of his fellow professors called to see how he was doing. We both felt the lack of response was due to fear by association since he knew half of his brother priests were gay. It still sucked.	1

"""Trumps [sic] the greater threat to the U.S.!"" Well, yes, obviously. But Trump is also a greater threat to world peace than North Korea. Note that Trump, the Trump Regime, and The America Treason Party want to deny many tens of millions of USA citizens health care. In the USA we already have about 45,000 citizens die every year due to the lack of medical care--- according to Harvard University, year 2013. The number is probably less now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Repealing the ACA will kill more USA citizens every year than died in Vietnam; more than in Korea; more than all the domestic Christian terrorists in the USA have; more than foreign non-Christian terrorists have."	1

Of course when referring to policy in the ME/NE/SWA and if it's working? You mean the Obama policy, right? As far as we know, Trump has left those policies in place for now. Not because he doesn't have one of his own, but because of Dem footdragging in the Senate confirmation process, the full DOS complement of appointees is being slow walked. All your examples were Obama failures. Especially qaddafi. I still wonder why he didn't promote himself from Colonel all those years, but I digress. I just hope our President doesn't try the out-of-session appointment trick, but waiting until the end of the month for Congress to come back is frustrating. Rep. Gabbard, for what it's worth, is speaking her mind and her thoughts outside of any influence from most in her party and is being both chastised and lauded. Just how its always been w/ elected officials and the general public. I wonder what she would have said if Wolf had asked her a question about Susan Rice. THAT would be good!.	0

As a resident of a Canadian city, I see multiculturalism in action every day and I like it. I own a small bookstore and my daily customers are from very diverse backgrounds. My impression is they are happy to be in Canada and enjoy participating in the community while having the freedom to engage in their own culture and heritage. They often are eager to share stories about their past, how they got here, and what it is like now. They want to hear my stories and are seem quite taken by the openness and diversity of their fellow Canadians, whether they are citizens, immigrants or refugees. That is perhaps why the yearly festival here called Folklorama is the biggest multicultural event in the world. As a friend of mine described it, her new neighbours are Nepalese, Indian, Indigenous and Portuguese, all of whom welcomed her to the neighbourhood when she moved there. She is fifth generation Francophone. Multiculturalism is a positive experience for many of us.	0

'Hypocrite' is almost certainly too strong a word. But there is a fundamental disconnect between talking about the vital importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time acting as an unabashed cheerleader for the domestic oil and gas industry (as Obama did as well). It's like someone trying to lose weight on a diet of cheeseburgers, cake and ice cream. Domestic politics aside, it should be noted that if Canada had the per capita emissions that Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia do *today*, we would easily meet the 2030 target, even with a population of 44 million.	1

"I didn't say ""gay makes you a pederast."" You keep drawing that conclusion. I did say that men who have tendencies for boys are homosexual. And that is exactly a subset of homosexual behavior. Likewise, if an adult had tendencies towards children of opposite gender, the heterosexual classification still applies. Both straight/gay alike who want' to act on sexual tendencies, are, hence, both called to lead celibate chaste lives. The Church specifies deep-seated homosexual behaviors as they differ. When a man sleeps with say a woman, they generally have a child - most often/common. Deep seated homosexual don't result in having to raise a child/children. Since people with preference of same gender cannot have children together. So the Church explicitly points out these actions do not follow from Christ's birth. Nor the necessity of life for Baptism. Also, the function of marriage between one man and one woman. That is why the homosexual act is scandalous, but isn't the worst of them."	1

The real reason for Kamala Harris' hypocrisy isn't stupidity, perhaps cruelty is a partial explanation, but the real reason for her hate for Joe Arpaio is that he is a white man who refused to bow to pressure to uphold immigration law. Kamala and her Marxist allies want uncontrolled, unlimited immigration from Mexico and elsewhere because it would accomplish two wet dreams for the commies: ensure future electoral invincibility for the Marxists, and ensuring that whites are a minority in America as quickly as possible. The latter point has been something that they don't hide, but have been openly looking forward to and celebrating for decades. Bill Clinton mused to an interviewer on how wonderful that will be 20+ years ago. Harris and all the rest of her radical Marxist allies hate you and want you dead unless you are a member of a group approved by the totalitarian, Marxist New World Soytopia. Hetero white males are not on that list, and will cease to exist if these SCUM win this war.	1

Creative people are always seen as slick. That is envy. Of course, some creativity is deciding to deal with crooks. That’s Trump. Meetings held at the Republican National Convention are, by nature, political. Anyone who who met with the Russians there showed poor judgment, the kind that should lead to a resignation. With Sessions, let’s wait until his seat is filled first. For the very latest on corruption, see the New Yorker article on Trump in Azerbejan or Rachel Maddow’s treatment of it last night. It takes the scandal to a level where Trump needs to not only be impeached, but jailed for not just being stupid, by willingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.	1

The $60,000 income or less provision insures that no one who can't afford a $1,000 tax bill will be asked to pay one. I am surprised they didn't raise it incrementally, but good for them. One correction, Bill 50 does not include neighborhood boards. It includes the neighborhood commission which sets policy for the neighborhood board system, approves any changes to board boundaries, dissolution of existing boards, creation of new boards, and adjudicates complaints against neighborhood boards. But it is separate from the neighborhood boards themselves. The original charter commission proposal clearly included them, so not sure why Bill 50 left them out.	0

The MTM Show was filmed in those halcyon days of far fewer channels and yet far superior programming. And to me, The MTM Show was the finest ensemble cast of actors ever assembled for any recurring series. The characters were all unforgettable but the most unforgettable of all was undoubtedly Mary Richards who gave the show its spark and its heart and who was virtually impossible not to like and admire and if one was a young adult male, to love. Beautiful, bright, independent, down to earth, humble and caring, Mary Richards somehow made a youngish guy (or at least this youngish guy) want to ravage and to comfort her simultaneously. I'll never forget the hilarious MTM characters including the two actors still alive in their 90s and, incredibly, still working (Betty White and Ed Asner), Ted Knight, Cloris Leachman, Valerie Harper (still alive and battling brain cancer) and others. All of them made me laugh. But only Mary Tyler Moore could turn my world on with her smile. RIP M!	0

"Rather shoddily written article: -in 2015, China emitted 10,642 Mt of CO2, and the US 5,172 Mt, less than half. Where does the graph data come from? -""Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year — enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather."" Given that sea levels are set to increase by 2-3 feet by 2100 (not 30 feet ""in the near future"" as Al Gore claimed), this will make a difference of an inch or two by 2100. Also, recent studies suggest that weather is not getting more extreme, but less extreme in recent years. -despite China emitting more than double (29.5% of global emissions) of what the US emits, they are not obligated to start reducing emissions until 2030 or later. This is simply ludicrous, especially when they already have a huge trade surplus (i.e. competitive advantage) w.r.t. to US and most other countries, on account of their manufacturing."	0

Late night Comics have forgotten that the American people need to relax. The reason that we tuned in to them in the past is because they made us laugh. It was a nice end to a sometimes difficult day. Now the comics want to be politicians or political analysts. They should leave these late-night spots and seek these kinds of jobs as we are not interested in their political opinions only their comedy. What has happened however is that many Americans particularly all of the Americans who wanted President Trump cannot watch them anymore. This country that all Americans love is under attack. If we don't come together as a nation and respect our president and our flag, we could very well be doomed. I have never witnessed such disrespect for the president of our country. This disrespect is not a laughing matter. Stephen Colbert should be ashamed of himself. And Jimmy Fallon hosted that great role model for young women, Miley Cyrus.

There are multiple needs conflicting with rural broadband. Without a doubt, it is a vital and ever more important part of daily life. Unfortunately, it is also very expensive to provide with rapidly escalating costs as density goes down. Investor owned utilities have little incentive to invest the billions still required to grow the service. State PUCs have used unrealistic service lives of up to 40 years on the outside plant needed for this service. Jump back 40 years ago, when cell phones were a novelty, cable was just emerging and phone lines were built around a 64 K voice grade standard -- guess the world changed a bit.  A new model of municipal owned exchanges will be required to solve this problem. The citizens will assume the risk, but they will be aided by both FCC and State revenue streams. It may even be socially desirable to provide limited funding from the general fund. But if those who stand to benefit will not assume the risk, why should we?	0

Roy, when did you become a rail engineer, and how many street level systems have you used? You’re unaware that modern light rail vehicles have wide doors with low floor rapid access and exit, using smart card sensors on board that quickly take fares, as I’ve witnessed in dozens of systems I have used. Street “stations” are unnecessary, it’s more like a bus stop. Future capacity can be added with double-deck trams. Regarding speed, even if light rail is a bit slower than elevated in the few miles from Middle to downtown, it delivers riders more quickly to the urban center (and eventually beyond to UH) rather than to Aloha Tower and the outdated, ridiculous end terminus at our tourist shopping mall that no local needs to reach during rush hour. As usual, the anti-street-level arguments make no sense. Witness Alto and his ludicrous scheme for a subway that he believes would be cheaper to build!	1

Yes, what has become clear in the past few months is that South Africa is a kleptocracy and the corruption and thieving and incompetence has become so huge and so blatant that every day we add years to the time it will take to recover. Also, the ANC has shown itself to be incapable of governing with integrity and excellence. If the DA is sincere about governing efficiently and effectively, with integrity, growing the economy and South Africa being a functional constitutional democracy with functioning institutions, then it cannot give up and must get rid of a bad president and bad government. Maimane has spent the past few months interacting with voters across the country, so he knows how bad things are and how people are suffering.	0

if any one thought the action of the united states marks an about-face in policy for trump is delusional. dumb old chump is and will always be a puppet played for the fool that he is by his advisors, world dignitaries, and the media. it has been the stated goal of neocons in america to bring about regime change in the middle east whether dumb old chump wants to play president or not. and it looks like he has been easily made to understand to toe the line as with his predecessors, singing the tunes of the military industrial establishment that would put the blush of pride into any mother wishing her son to be the ultimate lackey yes-man.	1

"Here's my take. As a mother trying to think how this scenario could come about. Why would I have my child give up their bed for what was expected to be 3 months? Probably to light a fire under my own kid's butt to move out. Given the little information we have, except that they live in Toronto, I will assume that LW is older than the cousin. Cousin is first time out of university and their own home, LW is a few years older, has a job but considers growing up and moving out ""Too expensive"". I don't think the mother is a doormat, I think she probably doesn't feel like she can criticize her niece's behavior when her own daughter seems like a miserable, immature person."	1

I think we all know why the EU was established. But it's gone way past its remit by trying to force all these countries to meld together, whether they want to or not, in ways that don't necessarily benefit all the countries equally. If the EU breaks up due to this, yeah, intra-European conflict indeed. But it wouldn't have to happen if the EU technocrats weren't so damned determined to focus all power in their hands and compromised more with national sensibilities. It also doesn't help that no one's forgotten what the Germans did to start the last major war - and that the Germans are now running the show.	0
I see part of your problem - not your fault entirely. There are multiple discrepancies between the table, the chart, and the correct Finance Canada data- no wonder you are struggling; specifically, their years and deficits do not match, and they are trying to rewrite history by having Mulroney present his budget before he was elected. Must be a Communications Graduate at work. That's why I always try to go to the source documentation when I can. Go to the Finance Canada stats like I suggested, you might not be too old to learn if you open your mind.	0
"The bromide that Republicans freed the slaves is way past shelf life. Southern bigots opposed the Civil Rights Act, ""When the bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the ""Southern Bloc"" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator led by Richard Russell (D-GA) launched a filibuster to prevent its passage.[14] Said Russell: ""We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our (Southern) states.""[15] Today, those senators' states all are Republican. Does anyone in their right mind really think Lincoln would be part of today's Republican party? In my earlier comments, JP, I was referring to the fact that many commentators who strongly dislike what they saw as ""political correctness gone amuck"" said it was time to stop all ""concessions"" including college admission preferences because we were all now perfectly equal."	0
I wonder what the ratio of your posts are complete speculation to actually having a clue? For example, it seems far-fetched to believe the Republican majorities have tried to work with any individual Democrat. Remember with the healthcare bills? Working with the Democrats was a threat if it didn't pass not an option to help pass it. One of the reasons why it was so laughable when Trump tried to blame the Democrats for it not passing.	0

I am not quite sure what you are trying to say. But I think you are looking at it from the wrong end. A business open to the public, Masterpiece Cakeshop, is refusing to provide a cake for a gay couple. The business is not participating in a religious ceremony, nor is it practicing a religion.

Meanwhile, though the Iranians are no angels, a moderate was overwhelmingly elected president, largely on the strength of the Iranian nuclear agreement, which Trump has signalled he wants to walk away from. President Manbaby's naive and unwise alignment of the United States with Sunni Islam against Shiites will do nothing but bring more death and destruction to the region.

Exactly. Partisanship is a form of bias that seeks to peruade, not just inform. The positive of partisanship, is that each side digs into the ugly stuff that the other will never self-report.

It is devastating how many secrets are going untold in this article. John Javelet is being charged with 4 counts of rape, because this girl had a false I.D that stated her age as 19 which means he had NO IDEA this girl wasn't over the age of 18. Yeah, he had a criminal record that wasnt very good but HE'S NOT A RAPIST AT ALL!!! Actually he is one of the best people i have ever met, he was the only one who protected me from my extremly abusive boyfriend.  Joshua Wesley Sherman is my BEST FRIEND. Yeah, his record is bad also but the Lane County Legal system is cruel and unusual. Most everything they claim he did wasnt true. They just pinned him guilty by making it his only option. They tell you the details they want to but they arent telling you EVERY DETAIL. Joshua wasnt present when the crime was commited he has an alibi but they silenced her. If the TRUTH came out maybe it wouldnt go unnoticed when the police do faulty ass shit.	1

All of the Republican legislators are 'tax and spend liberals'. They believe in welfare...for oil companies. They won't give up their boondoggles or their perks, they have to have a new palace even as they cut schools. The Republican Majority rudely ignored every amendment to SB21 offered by Democrats to protect the state at low prices, transparency, hire Alaskans etc. Since they waste so much money and don't want to follow the Alaska state Constitution and collect our fair share of oil profits, The Republican Majority Senate already passed a bill last year to take your PFD for government spending. One of the problems we have here is that Alaskan Republicans keep voting for anyone who puts an R by their name. They think Alaskans are fools and will just vote for them because they are Republican. I would be so embarrassed if they kept taking advantage of my trust. I understand it is embarrassing but sometimes you have to admit you made a mistake and STOP VOTING FOR THESE LIARS!	0

Pervert? Really? Very fair of you, don't you think? Glad I'm not a snowflake or I might demand civil comments... No, I said it is for believers. You are a believer, so it applies to you. (You love to play games, but you are more of a believer than you think.) You are right about one thing, Matthew 25:31-46 is the only part of chapter 25 that isn't a parable. But we have to take the Gospels as a whole, and some parts can't be a command to the whole world and others a command to His disciples. But what confuses me the most is your insistence that we are a secular society but you want us to act according to a biblical mandate. And no, we as a society do not, ever, never, at no time, need to act kind because of a DEMAND. You would be the first to scream to high heaven if a demand to act was placed on you. So quit being a hypocrite and just debate the issue on the merits of your argument and quit speaking for others.	1

The sign was just fine until the words on it offended someone. Certainly signage laws should be enforced and obeyed. Now lets talk about the A frame signs on sidewalks. No? Signage enforcement is only for this sign? There-in lies the issue. The sign was ugly and poorly done. This enforcement was selective and content based. I'm not on any side, just pointing out the obvious which no one else will. ""Queer"" is legal, based on Langley legal precedent, to call someone; whether they object or not.

Complete garbage. His agreed upon salary with the Foundation was $180,00 which was less than his Chief Justice salary. And he was actually getting paid that - the foundation could not afford to do so - so the disclosed payments to Moore are accurate. And you snide remark about Moore being like a televangelist betrays your anti-Christian bigotry.	1
If he is looking at tax cuts then he should restore the basic amount to a realistic level. It was $10,027 in 2016 which is nearly 10% less than it was in 2011 ($11,088). This affects low paid workers particularly and should be around $12,000 to account for the effects of inflation. Just another way this government has been grabbing more and more tax over the last 5 years, in fact acting more like the NDP.	0
Speak from experience? Is that what happened to you when you met trump?	0
"""France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, all are small governments with modern economies"". With an personal income tax rates of roughly 50% could hardly be considered a small government. Those tax rates vary in these countries but the average in roughly 50%. So yes, before some idiots jumps out and shows one country that is with less than 50% there some less than 50%."	1
I agree with the writer. There is to much fear and he speaks the truth when he talks of foolish people. There is alot of stupid going around, it seems to be breeding also. You don't run a trail with an ipod in your ears when you know there are bear in the area. You certainly don't run or hike where you know there are salmon spawning this time of year. I lived around brown bears in the bush in southeast for seven straight years. Close proximity, even walking up to the dump to put trash in while 3 were laying only 25 feet away and nothing happened, they didn't even move. I knew how to behave around them and how to act. More people need to learn how to behave in bear country and there would be less attacks, less maulings. Stupidity will get you killed in Alaska and this advice is for all the lower 48rs who have moved here and for those who come to visit. Brown bears are not something to fear, they are beautiful animals and just need their space.	1
Meanwhile, low and mid-level entrepreneurs are fleeing the cities because of the high tax base, crime, and labor issues. It's looking more and more like a 4-year degree is a ticket to only one kind of life: urban corporate dronehood. If you want to actually raise a family, instead of a credit card debt, a young man might want to rethink that.	0
If you actually think that Drumpf and his crew care about you and this country well... they've thrown a bone to the little people to appease them at the moment, his tax cuts won't affect you as a matter of fact depending on your income you may be paying more while his 1% buddies rake in more money, and speaking of wolves whom do you think will be occupying the W.H. NOT little red riding hood, the rights recently earned by the disenfranchised are in danger, and a woman's right to make her own decisions may be very well in jeopardy, they have no desire to take us forward but backwards about 50-60 years	0
When the PRC honestly looks to address human rights issues, political freedoms and the rule of law, maybe then some discussion can start. Anyone who wants free trade with an authoritarian regime that tolerates no political freedoms needs to look in the mirror and decide whether his wallet or his basic decency and integrity is most important. I expect my public policy makers to have some character and choose the latter. The rude and demanding behaviour of their ambassador tells us all we need to know about how this relationship would play out.	0

I do not oppose gun ownership. On the other hand, I know way around them and I respect them. What I oppose is about 99 percent of comments in which people opine that if so-and-so had been armed with a firearm fill-in-the-blank situation would have come out better. In most of those cases an armed victim would either not have made a difference (at best) or would have resulted in a perpetrator getting his hands on a brand new weapon (worst case). Your second scenario - in which a family member intervenes is valid in my opinion. Training, licensing and permitting competent stalking or harassment victims is also valid. Carrying a firearm wedged in your car seat in case someone gets in your face in traffic is not valid. Etc.	0
Broncos need to clean it up - a lot and everyone including coaches. We weren't up to the challenge on the road, we wouldn't have even won at home with that performance. TS made some bad decisions (2) and throws (several) but so did Vance (1 punt decision) and Von (1 unsportsmanlike) among many others by the rest of the team. Our vaunted D also gave up 26pts without forcing any TOs on BUF. It was a total team failure, including some stupid penalties that extended drives for BUF. Not much help from STs either, other than the McManus FGs. All in all, we sucked today. Let's hope KC and Oak also stumble... but I doubt it.	1

Seriously, how the right continues to yawn at this story is jaw-dropping. Every American should care, yet the Fox/Breitbart/Trump bots could really care less.

Trump is a loudmouth fool who only talks loud to cover up his ignorance and divisive nature. He is not a person who will unify the country but will instead use the POTUS platform to advance his own businesses and will ultimately reduce this once great country to rubble or is it ruble? He should stick to failing businesses and failing marriages.	1

Why aren't we seeing media orgs and journalists attacking this elephant in the room? Trudeau reneged MASSIVELY on his promise on electoral reform. That backpedaling was tantamount to a scandal and yet here we are, months later and media still salivating and licking their chops, pillorying Trump daily.	1
Obviously, the only way one can learn history is through idolatry. If my child wanted to learn history, I would tell them to go stare at a statue. That's why in Germany, children do not learn about the holocaust and do not visit sites...but rather, they have statues of adolf hitler everywhere. It's sad that idiotic liberals actually believe history can be learned by reading and/or visiting museums etc	1

FREEMAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TRUMP CONFUSION TO ADVANCE HER PERSONAL AGENDA AND CAREER. WATCH OUT! It's no secret the Freeman is a Russia hater, a Ukraine lover. Russia - 25 years of stable democracy now in world leadership role, admired by many, defeated Islamic State in Syria, strategic partner of China. Ukraine - 20 years of upheaval, civil war, economic bankruptcy, coup and Neo-Nazism. Lost Crimea because that autonomous region voted to split due to illegal coup to topple the president it voted in. Into this Freeman picks side. Nobody in Canada urge her to do so. Freeman suggest Canada rearm. Is she going to restart America's Cold War 2 on Russia now that Trump admit it's a stupid lost cause? Yes, Canada will lead the way in a new Cold War to defeat Russia!! Out American stupidity, in Trudeau's hand-picked stupidity. It is shocking Trudeau allows Freeman to turn Canadian foreign policy into a tool of her personal ambition, her personal vendetta. Get rid of this nonsense.	1

Immigrants r the reason why I agree with Trump. Can't speak a lit of english. Americans we are allowing immigrants to learn the American dream and they going to use it against us. I love in Chicago. I hate it's a sanctuary city. We have a big population of immigrants. The Mayor only care about the well being of immigrants. He don't care about what's going on in the black community. He trying to get funding for immigrants. He don't care what happens to blacks. We can kill ourselves. That makes more room for immigrants. He always talking about money to build more things for tourist. That can bring jobs. If all this violence keep happening. Ain't no tourist be coming to Chicago. He need to get Chicago right first. His vote is out for me being re elected. 4 and a half finger lol. Trump u need help building that wall. America is black and white not immigrants. Immigrants are sneaky.

Australians have a similar mentality, whenever someone enters a known crocodile environment, and is taken by a croc, locals go on a crocodile hunt. In my opinion, it's pathetic human behaviour. We really should accept responsibility for our own actions, and when entering a wilderness area where wild animals are known to exist, we must accept that the risk is entirely our own, and the consequence of an encounter with a wild animal is not the fault of the animal, nor is the animal to blame.	1

Harper cost us a fortune losing on this battle TWICE, and it's good we have a PM who is not so blinded by ideology that he wastes millions of taxpayer money losing AGAIN.

They had nothing substantive or consequential to offer us. They just wanted to get on a bullhorn and scream senseless nonsense to attract attention to their intellectually bankrupt cause. Sorry, but we have no obligation whatsoever to listen to nonsense and idiocy. The long and short of it is this: There is no plan for Hawaiian ""independence."" None whatsoever.

"Then you haven't been reading the comments. That type of comment is a constant leitmotif among a certain segment of commenters, and dismissing them as insignificant while claiming a few hotheads making hateful comments about Muslims are a major social problem is rather one-sided.

Why is it ""ironic or somewhat hypocritical ""to talk about our society being secular when so much of it has a religious origin""? There is no contradiction. Of course our society and culture has religious origins, respecting those origins doesn't mean we aren't secular now. Just as our society has features based on paganism, others based on Roman or Greek origins, it doesn't mean we are either pagan, Greek or Roman now.

"The unions love the ""pay their fair share"" slogan. It would ring more true to me if the tax they favor (and will try again with another of their own initiatives) was actually a corporate tax instead of the most regressive of sales taxes, with no way to exempt food or medicine when corporations pass it on to the consumer. Why don't the unions consider another tax that would be far more fair, like raising income taxes on both corporations and high-income individuals? And the unions could support a temporary suspension of pension accruals, especially for the Tier 1 members. That would be ""paying their fair share"", but they refuse. The unions have completely alienated most voters, and this is bound to be reflected in future elections."	0

Yes this Broncos team is pretty good. But they seem to have hired another timid coaching staff. Just like the last two coaches, as soon as the Broncos built a solid lead, the Broncos stopped mixing up their plays and started trying to run out the clock. This doesn't work if you don't have a dominant offensive line, and they don't. No surprise they got pushed back on their heels, started turning the ball over, then playing tentative defense as well, almost blowing the game. These coaches need to learn that you win NFL games by playing aggressively on both sides of the ball for 60 minutes, not 45 minutes.	0
"Right! And our federal government is just overrun with such ""honorable"" people who never ever lie! When more than half of US States recognize the medical and far-safer-than-alcohol recreational use of cannabis, then its only a matter of time before the criminal abuse of US citizens will end. Cannabis is now the cash cow of the judicial system and its multiple private contractors, such as prison corps. Hopelessly outdated information that a minority hopes that with repetition will come true, is a fool's game. Belief in the 80+ year old ""Reefer Madness"" propaganda ignores the reality of the benefits and safety of cannabis that has been proven scientifically over and over again. Even the Feds know this but big money creates filthy hypocrisy. Ignoring proof of modern pharmacology and global medical studies merely delays the inevitable, and costs us all mega bucks and individual freedom. Can't figure out if this minority are control freaks, need psych care or are just plain stupid."	1

The good doctor was a paying passenger. He was just sitting in his seat trying to get home and the airline calls the cops on him. The airline is totally responsible, they overbooked the flight, they should have found another way to get their employees to Louisville, they turned this into a law enforcement encounter. Seriously who calls the cops on a paying customer! And yes it may be a flight operated by a contractor, but its still a United branded flight and you bet United had better address this action that was done in their name.	0

The administration of evil moves increasingly toward a right-wing religious jihad, nothing American about it.

None of these so-called food allergies and sensitivities existed back in the day when kids were exposed to things from birth and allowed to develop natural defenses.

It also makes them stupid, and unable to cope with even minor problems in real life.	1
This article is pure delusion, pure distortion, and a big fat lie, to boot. Saunders and The Globe haven't caught up with the rest of us who already know what's going on in Europe. We read German news and have a huge pool of online information available to us so that we can get the straight goods and make up our own minds about what is actually happening. None of this information is hard to find. Too bad I can't share any of it, due to the Globe's tendency to censor difficult truths. But really folks, if you believe what Saunders is writing, you are being played for fools.	1

When you put on the uniform, you swear to uphold the Constitution, not the political party of your choice. For a proposed Commander and Chief of this country to openly ask an unfriendly foreign power to hack the private emails of an opposing political party or a private US citizen is treason.

They don't have much of an option except to work with it and hope that changing back to democracy is still a possibility in the future."	0
Agree. Naming an airport after a person and not its actual location is the most confusing, stoopidest thing you can do. Also agree it was done WITHOUT public input by two neighbor island State legislatures, Ron Kouchi and Scott Nishimoto (a former aide to Inouye), who control the legislature. I will never use the name Inouye airport and always refer to it as Honolulu airport, especially to people who do not live in Hawaii. As others point out name the Oahu train to nowhere project as the Daniel K Inouye train line.	0

Come on folks surely our adversaries if they choose to say shoot a missile at the OLF it would mess up the landscape not to mention those lovely border blocks everyone is raving about. Only fair that someone inform the little big man in North Korea that before he can fire one his missiles in our direction he has some paperwork to fill out. Oh don' t forget also to inform the little big man that the paperwork is subject to a committee vote. Being a party man I would assume he would be comfortable with that.

In addition to the 250TCF of identified methane reserves in gas-domes over associated crude oils we also have another 200+TCF in methane hydrates in Nslope. Plus we can gasify 100% of Nslope CRUDE to make another 1000TCF of alkanes. Plus we can gasify 100% of AK-Coal to make another 5000TCF of alkanes. Plus we can gasify 100% of wildfire biomass to make endless alkanes. Big problem is; anything we do, such as EM-drive rocket engines or AKLNG, China will beat us to it on a fast end-run, this deflates the value of AKLNG as it's currently designed. FLEXIBILITY of AK-Gas delivery system is our only hope of making a profit from AK-gas. LNG is NOT the ONLY product we can make from AK-gas. Talk of GTL and the Delberts for DilBit wanna stuff it into TAPS risking more oil spills. GTG can profitably convert fluffy methane into EZ to move LPG & alkanes. Polyolefins in Alaska is a superior pathway, ask Gov.Dalrymple of North Dakota. AK-made flexpipe is more valuable than the gas shipped in it.	0

That is truly hilarious. Our current PM lacks the intellect, education and experience to write a speech on anything more complicated than his favourite action hero. His speeches and virtually everything else he utters in public are carefully prepared by smarter and more experienced people in the bowels and the Butts of the PMO and are then reviewed by one or more others. If the speech is important enough, as this one probably was seen to be, key cabinet and deputy ministers may also input and review the speech. As a former drama student and drama teacher, Justin's one talent is delivery and he sounds like he actually knows what he is talking about. If only it were so! Oh well, he fooled you. I am baffled as to how any rational person could contend that The Doltish, Dimpled, Dilettantish Dauphin from 24 Sucks Us Dry has the common touch while actual folks born, raised and remaining part of the middle class like Scheer and Rempel do not. Perhaps it takes a special kind of stupid.	1

"I don't know why you keep insisting that treatment for gender dysphoria makes the military a ""social service organization."" Does treatment for ptsd, sexual dysfunction or depression qualify also? All these conditions, as well as others, are treated by the military in keeping service members fit for duty. Only if the conditions make them unfit for duty are they discharged. Studies have shown that treatment, which does not always include reassignment surgery, does not have as much of an effect upon military readiness as critics claim. And, btw, gender dysphoria is becoming recognized as a medical condition, and not a mental illness. It's much like homosexuality was once considered a mental illness, but no longer. It is also not related to sexual orientation. Please get past the ""ickiness"" of the subject that hysterics focus on."	1

"I think that the idea of cultural appropriation CAN be an issue in criticism. It can generate some insights, such as those the author expressed in his example of the various types of forest gods in literature, poetry, art, etc. However, what could be a valid CRITICISM of a work of art isn't really what's being encouraged: what's being encouraged is a blacklisting of various works and their creators when they are deemed to have committed cultural appropriation. In other words, they are not saying ""I see an appropriation of an idea that can only be expressed by people with such-and-such an experience/background/etc."" They are saying ""I see an appropriation of an idea that can only be expressed by people with such-and-such an experience/background/etc. Therefore, No One should be allowed to see/read/hear it.""

Are you saying that everyone who voted for Trump knew he was lying when he promised healthcare for everyone, better and cheaper than the ACA? That everyone who voted for Trump knew he was lying when he promised not to cut Medicaid, either in dollars or in persons covered? That everyone who voted for Trump knew he was lying when he promised to preserve coverage for pre-existing conditions? That everyone who voted for Trump knew he was lying when he said he was pro-life, that he would protect healthcare for women and children? I could never wrap my head around the notion that anyone believed any of those things, but some people did. I know some of them; and they know they were duped. Of course, Trump has a base of supporters who didn't believe any of those things and don't care about them. These are the idiots who think Mexico is going to pay for a wall; the bigots who want to exclude Muslims; the racists who want to deflate minority voting; the science deniers; and the very, very rich.	0

"No more ""drawing a red line or a line in the sand"". It's getting embarrassing since neither Obama nor Trump really meant it. The big problem with teaching Kim a lesson by attacking is that the U.S. has 26,000 or so American troops in S.Korea within U.S. Army and Air Force bases. If Kim retaliates by attacking S.Korea, many of our GI's will die. That will lead us to annihilate Pyongyang and we will be called the aggressor. The only practical way is to strike from within North Korea, with internal ""kill Kim"" assassins. Money, a great deal, talks. Do to Kim like he did to his half-brother."	1

Affirmative action was enacted to balance the clear damage done to the education of black citizens because of blatant racial discrimination in funding and quality of primary education. It was a good idea and more than most support, actually did help America's black citizens improve their educational opportunity.  As far as the whiner goes, if admitting a relatively small number of minority students that did not meet the current academic measurement, cost him/her admission then they were only marginally acceptable in the first place. That still leaves them hundreds of schools as options for admissions. If there is damage, and there could be, it is in lowering the expectation for academic progress once in the college. It the same risk as setting the goal of 100% high school graduation - you will never get that unrealistic number and it increases the likelihood of lowering standards, or out right cheating on results.

Actually, no - Trump is the proof that democracy does work. Firstly, US democracy was designed with a situation in mind that a completely random person can become a president - that's what's built in. It happened, like it or not. Secondly, US democracy was designed so that even in a situation when a completely random person becomes a president, there are still checks and balances regarding the damage he can do. So far, Trump's rule was very short on outrageously stupid decisions of meaningful impact, even if there are plenty of not widely popular decisions made. Thirdly, even with Trump at helm, you can be certain that there'll be an election in four years where Trump can be unseated, and in eight years Trump will be gone.	0

The Republicans (some reluctantly) embraced Trump as a useful idiot who would sign the legislation they expected a Republican congress to grind out. They underestimated not only his corruption, incompetence and instability, but also their own. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are easily the two biggest hypocrites and cowards in Washington, and perhaps in history (time will tell). Ryan and McConnell have a laser-like focus on one thing: taking health care away from as many people as they can in order to transfer the money to the wealthiest people in the country. They will abandon Trump when and if they determine that he is no longer a useful idiot but merely an ordinary idiot who impedes their pursuit of tax cuts for the wealthy. Trump could have terminated Comey any time before Comey announced the investigation of the Trump campaign. After that, the termination is what it appears to be: a criminal attempt to cover up a federal investigation. History will see it as a turning point.	1

"Indeed. There is one excellent, brilliant publication: Margaret Farley proposes, in her outstanding book ""Just Sex.

Of course, the CDF (so zealous that it misunderstood Farley's intent to propose a framework for discussion and accused her of proclaiming a new doctrine, which she of course never wanted to do) condemned Farley's work - thereby providing the author with a marketing coup she could have never dreamed of.

"Re ""we can lump together the issues of wetland management, land-use planning and runaway development"" - we shouldn't because 40 inches of rain has virtually the same runoff as 40 inches of rain on development .. most will run off, so preserving wetlands will not but a dent in risks for storm of this magnitude. The exposure of more development in the risk zones is the biggest factor. In Ontario we have the same extensive development as Houston over past decades and it explains local risks more for our typical ""4 inch"" design storms: http://www.cityfloodmap.com/2016/08/urbanization-and-runoff-explain.html In small urban watersheds this can explain higher runoff and flood risk - see growth in Ontario cities since the mid 1960's: http://www.cityfloodmap.com/2016/08/land-use-change-drives-urban-flood-risk.html So to explain Mississauga flooding in 2013 in Cooksville Creek, look at the urbanization over 50 years.

Or how about this: ""How about considering the affect on both cost and recidivism for illegals who are sent to do their prison time in China..."" (Rep. Dennis Richardson's newsletter (1/21/11). He also compared the legalization of gay marriage to the Virginia Tech massacre of 2007 calling both ""tragic.""

To me it is quite obvious that the way we compute inflation is wrong. Inflation needs to account for everything that happens in the economy, including the housing market. Can you imagine the protests we'd see in the streets if the price of gas were to go up by 35% tomorrow? would anybody be excited if any comodity's cost would swell? We all agree that those who buy at this time are stupid, and deserve whatever it's coming to them... but their being stupid will affect us all. The government created this mess with the 40 years long mortgages, 5% down payments, CMHC and almost free money... I get that they don't have any incentive to stop the craziness (the respective party will probably be banished from government for a generation , or two), but nobody else can fix this... Am I holding my breath? not really: we will continue to muddle along, kicking the can down the road, until some external cause will crush the housing market.	1

"Wonderful commentary Mr. Begich, thank you for adding your voice of rational and reasoned thought to this debate. One of my favorite examples of the forces of anti fascism is that of the landing craft at Normandy unloading thousand of Allied soldiers while underneath the caption says, ""Group of anti Nazi protesters confronts a large gathering of Nazi sympathizers"". The time to confront fascism has long come and gone even as the evil has grown inside the nations heartland. We defeated it before and we will defeat it again. The Nazis in Charlottesville were given a permit for their rally on Saturday but they went off the rails on Friday night with the tiki torch parade so their permit was revoked. Meanwhile the anti fascist/racist/nazi demonstrators were given a permit by city government for a rally in a different part of town on Saturday.

No one can say whether any one particular weather event is related to climate change. But we can watch for trends. Hurricane record keeping was somewhat spotty in the early 1900s, at least until the hurricane hit land, and I suspect the current classification of hurricanes (Category One, Category Five, etc.) came much later, but it would be interesting to compare the average intensity of hurricanes that landed on the continental US in the first or second decade of the 1900s to the average intensity of hurricanes that landed on the continental US in the first decade of the 2000s. But I suspect weather research is on the chopping block of Trump's budget requests. We have a functioning FEMA because Trump hasn't had enough time yet to mess it up.	0

A very small portion of the population were slaves that were sold to Arab slave traders for a few trinkets and used all over the world, not just here. The Civil war was about territory and resources like many wars. Slavery was a by-product of that war. Slavery was invented in Africa. More slavery goes on around the world today than the miniscule numbers here 100's of years ago. Why don't you come up with a new leftist issue?	1

"Most new condos and apartments in the West End use electricity for space heating and hot water. Even the fireplace is electric instead of gas. Why? Because it's cheaper for the builder to install. Meanwhile occupants end up with power bills four times as much as gas, thanks to Hydro's two-tier power rate. But that's what Christy and Mayor Moonbeam want. Electrify the city and then export all our gas (carbon-tax free) for the rest of the world to burn! However, there is a heavy price to pay for this folly. A $9 billion dam, thousands of acres flooded, more transmission lines and substations. All unnecessary if we didn't have this ""holier than thou"" attitude when it comes to the domestic consumption of gas. BC with 0.06% of the planet's population will show the world, no matter what the cost!"	0

I know damn well if it had happened to one of her grandchildren she would have moved heaven and earth to get that cop fired and punished.

"""...You are saying that extreme black on black violence and carnage is not news for the MSM. Is that correct?..."" No, you're saying that to create something out of nothing. If one isn't smart enough to dig deeper than the fluff that's thrown in their face by biased news media (which exists on ALL sides), then they're probably an idiot and not worth talking to. The problems in Chicago do not preclude the problems in Charlotte, the idiocy of Trump, any extreme left wing group that supports racist behavior, or any reprehensible behavior at all. Even a person of average intelligence can consider many issues without having to exclude the others. The problem we're dealing with here is that those with questionable behavior immediately deflect and try to point at problems elsewhere, and those that support them do the same. Reality is Trump is a racist who is supported by racist morons and he didn't have the courage to call them out, just as many other politicians have done."	1

Dude, I hold several degrees, among them Physics. I KNOW what the heck I'm talking about. You once again show YOUR lack of education by spouting off stupid talking points. Yes, the Earth wobbles, those are called Milankovitch Cycles. And there is NO WAY that those cycles are causing the recent warming. The Earth should, by those measures, be cooling. That it is instead warming is even more alarming. Scientists - i.e. those who know more than you - have long since known that the M-Cycles cannot account for what is going on. Yes, the planet has had several ice ages - in fact several in the last 2 million years or so. What caused those? Several things, including the M-Cycles. What's different this time? The amount of atmospheric CO2 is much higher than it has even been in that time. There is less than a 1 in 1 million chance that CO2 level is NOT an indicator of average global temp. Given that they are higher than they have been in 2 million years, it's going to get hot.	0

If that GOP tactic is good enough for the US senate to delay confirmation on judicial appointments until the November election, then it's good enough for this legislature to delay action on Gov. Walker’s hell-bent strategy to raid of our permanent fund and pick our pockets until next year's legislative session.	0

"Most of what you say is true. But to lay the blame on EVs is wrong. Today, most cobalt goes into consumer electronics: over a billion cellphones, 500 million tablets, laptops, and PCs, and millions of cameras, power tools and other portable devices. But I see no faux outrage over that. About 120,000 tonnes of cobalt is mined as a by-product of copper and nickel. Less than a quarter from reprehensible ""artisanal"" mining. In comparison, we consume 100,000,000 barrels per DAY of oil. Vehicle air pollution causes 53,000 premature deaths each year just in the U.S. alone. The extraction, transportation, refining and ultimate burning of gasoline and diesel has a human and environmental cost that is orders of magnitude greater than from electric vehicle batteries. Rather than blame EVs, it would be more productive to add Cobalt to the list of ""conflict"" minerals and strengthen existing international sanctions."	0

"Sociopaths fool people every everyday. They are amazingly stupid in a number of important ways, but I believe that in some limited but powerful ways sociopaths are much smarter than ordinary people. Trump is a classic sociopath, with his own version of the superficial charm they are known for; serial, pathological lying; the lack of conscience, empathy or any sense of responsibility; the devaluing; the vindictiveness; the unrepentant taking without giving; and numerous other predictable traits that most people don't get. People are looking for specific acts/form to let them know the sociopath is a bad person, but that's not how it works. Trump also has the uncanny gift of being able to read his ""target,"" the instinct to be able to ""mirror"" and reflect their wounds and longings, and the ability to manipulate through deflection, digression and word-salad. Trump is a symptom of the rage of many Americans at the abuse of the wealthy toward the many. It's not a good sign."	1

The basic physics of AGW was well worked out in the 1800s, adding more GHGs to the atmosphere will drive temperatures up in all parts of the biosphere. Many nations are now addressing AGW through investments in energy efficiency, substituting natural gas for coal and rolling out renewable energy projects. Annual double digit drops in the cost of wind and solar power will make renewable electricity generation increasingly cheap. For transportation fossil fuels will predominate for some time, perhaps decades.	0

Bob, you might have had concerns if clinton got in! But then you are pushing a different agenda! The FBI document notes that the email was in fact marked “classified at the Confidential level.” And when asked about different classification types like “Top Secret,” Clinton went on to say she “did not pay attention to the ‘level’ of classified information and took all classified information seriously.” Further, Clinton “could not give an example of how classification of a document was determined.”    Such passages could help explain why FBI Director James Comey said during congressional testimony in July that there were questions over whether Clinton was “sophisticated enough” to know at the time what a particular classified marking signified.  These documents demonstrate Hillary Clinton's reckless and downright dangerous handling of classified information during her tenure as secretary of state.	0

Oh pish tosh mr kon. The GOP/trump own this thing now. They spent their last seven years staging 59 votes to repeal the PPACA rather than coming up with anything different that would in reality make the PPACA better for the American people. What they have proposed is what was vetted by the CBO and that non-partisan organization came up with the GOP plan costing 24 Million people their access to healthcare and for many their very lives. If they had prepared a more complete plan which they had seven years to construct then the CBO would have scored that. They didn't because the PPACA is their plan from way back in the Clinton days. The crap burger they submitted was thrown together so hastily and shoved out of the only two committees allowed to debate it so far that the CBO hasn't had time to fully vet the macroeconomic effects but that shoe will be dropping on their heads in the next few days. Those numbers will reduce the cost savings gained by slashing Medicaid to close to nothing.sad	1

"Don't get me started. I think it was very brave of Premier Wynne to say no (BTW I am not a supporter). She knew there would be blow back but understood that this was primarily a tax on people in other communities to subsidize low property taxes in Toronto. I live in Markham and have the privilege of paying 20% higher property taxes than Torontonians and pay hundreds of dollars a month for 407 tolls and I get to see much of my provincial income tax go to support funding for Toronto. My only complaint for of the Premier on this issue is she didn't tell the Mayor to ""suck it up buttercup"" earlier. The federal and provincial governments are contributing generously to the Mayor's ""Smart Track"" plan. He is now trying to unload Toronto's portion on the backs of commuters. Shame. Torontonians need to pay their share."	0

I'm not sure this is intended as a legal defense. The incident took place 31 years ago. Not recalling events after three decades is not unusual. Regan was President, the Soviet Union still existed, and the NY Mets won the World Series. I may be wrong, but the Statute of Limitations in NY would be 5 years at most. And the incident, as described, would be a misdemeanor and not a felony. Kevin Spacey is neither denying nor admitting the incident happened. He is simply saying he can't recall it. And he apologized, which is about all he can do. Rapp has said he consulted a lawyer who advised him there was no case worth pursuing. I don't know if Rapp tried contacting Spacey before going public. I am not sure what he wants to have happen now.	0

Low voter turnout is just one symptom of the weakening bond between citizens and their representatives in office. In its original conception, government of, by, and for the people meant that citizens voted directly on legislation and executive proposals. Today, we have a representative democracy, where the citizens don't typically vote on legislation and executive proposals, but instead rely on elected representatives to vote their interests. A central question in our democracy revolves around how well representatives represent citizens. If the bond between representatives and citizens weakens too much, then we effectively lose our representative democracy and our nation takes on characteristic that led to the revolutionary war. A major corrosive of the bond between citizen and representative is outside money in elections. An individual should be prohibited from contributing to a politician who doesn't directly represent him/her.	0

I think the definitive argument is that all those other studies Dr. Soh mentions support what one can see in everyday life. Despite strenuous efforts at recruiting women into STEM occupations, in encouraging girls to select STEM as their majors when going to university, and despite a total lack of evidence that women are being discriminated against in hiring or acceptance at university (rather the opposite) women continue to be underrepresented in the STEM occupations. That's particularly true of the hard sciences. This under representation is due to self-selection, not discrimination. And it means Google attempting to have a 50/50 gender quota would require they hire basically any woman who applied, regardless of how talented they are in comparison with the horde of male applicants.	0

The problem with the USA's tax code is it was written by lawyers who left loopholes for rich people. We should have a flat tax and a standard deduction per person in a family. Tax at the flat rate above the standard deduction. I recommend something in the 40K range per person as a deduction and a flat 30% tax that includes medical. That way a family of four only pays taxes on income over 160,000. This will put all the money back into the economy and billionaires will pay closer to 30% than nothing like they pay now. We also need to bring FICA taxes back to just being paid by taxes and take that burden off business. They used it as a slush fund to pay the tax shortfall not a trust fund anyway.	0

I don't see any point to giving any special treatment to veterans just because they are homeless, they had some advantages at their disposal and chose not to use same.

"This author is a bonehead. Maybe he can come to Vancouver and see what his proposals have done for affordability here.

They can own commercial property or purpose built rental housing, but there's not reason a non-resident needs to or should be allowed to own a residence. This is such a boneheaded simple solution to the ""foreign"" problem it makes me want to yank my hair out that it's not even being discussed. They want to own property here? Buy up rental housing and rent it out. Makes them money, they get to own property, we get a place to live. Done. 2) Cap the primary residence cap gains exemption at $250K.

Mitch McConnell is an odious man.

If McConnell is now hoisted onto a petard of his own making because Donald Trump has decided to scapegoat him for all of his own personal failures as POTUS, sending all his ditto-heads running after McConnell with pitchforks, it couldn't happen to a more deserving jerk.

Your revisionist history is pretty foggy. Trudeau pere, through the NEP, at least tried to make the foreign energy giants pay a pittance for sucking the riches out of this country.

The lowest in the world. That's why Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund is over $1 trillion and Alberta's is around $17 billion. The Conservatives gave away the provincial patrimony (not that Klein would remember, hiccup), whereas Trudeau fought the cartels.	0

Sadly, it did overwhelm Hillary. He was not going to lose the pro-choice vote. She should not have taken the bait on partial birth abortion in the debates, since it is already banned under federal law. She should have used this opportunity to show that Trump was as much of an ignorant panderer as Sarah Palin was when she could not describe what she disliked about Roe and then she should have attacked the pro-life movement as an organ of GOP politics and that people should not be fooled, even if some of the Catholic bishops cooperate with their little game. Could she have won? Maybe. She certainly could not have lost any worse in PA, MI, OH, WI. She could have also said that when the two W. appointees were given the chance to overturn Roe, they did not do so. Its a powerful argument that the pro-life judicial strategy is bankrupt and should not affect elections. That and Booker should have been on the ticket.	1

"Well, Alceste, it doesn't disciminate per se. It just doesn't allow people to have sex outside of marriage. Any LGBTQ person is welcome to be a student, although I don't see why they would want to be (or frankly anyone else). Presumably we can all control our sexual urges -- certainly the law expects us to be able to. TWU also expects heterosexual non-married persons to refrain -- so that is the largest group that the statement ""discriminates"" against. Assuming that you buy into the idea that sexual interaction is a necessary part of sexual identity, then you can get to where you are and no doubt many people, including certain members of the SCC buy into that argument. The real issue here, however, is about balancing rights.

gadabouti - your comments are not quite true. In the case of Courtenay - Comox it will factor into the result with a nine vote difference. Many of the Absentee votes are Canadian Armed Forces personnel stationed outside of the country. The Liberal candidate trailing by nine votes is a retired officer from CFB Comox. I have a bet that many of these Absentee votes will go to this candidate for this riding. The NDP lead is slim in two ridings and both could go Liberal. The Liberals lead is only slim in one riding.	0

"Mainstream liberal media were all stunned by Trump's victory in spite of their unceasing and relentless demonizing of Trump as being a racist, a bigot, etc. etc. It appears that mainstream liberal journalists can not accept a presidency of Donald Trump ergo this so-called ""racism"", one of the very thing to demonize Trump during the election campaign. But on the question - Why did people vote for Trump Simple: (1) Build the wall (2) Renegotiate trade agreements (3) Drain the Swamp. Racism?

I for one feel it's kinda fitting that the guy instrumental in forcing the ANC on us come back to clean up some of their corruption. He'll obviously never be able to undo state capture, or even prevent the ANC from turning us into a failed state, but like I said, let him use his privileged European perspective to at least try and clean up the mess he's helped create for those of us forced to live through disastrous ANC rule. Apparently the dear lord also insisted there was no evidence of BAE corruption in the arms deal, so maybe he's only good at spotting non-ANC corruption.

You set the bar low for just about any subject, often perform well and then judge yourselves against others and always come up superior.

Absolutely guaranteed that if an income tax is ever instituted, elected officials such as Rep. Gara, will be on their soap box within two years after it is started demanding that it be increased.

I consider myself a moderate democrat; however, I think we need to get both parties together on this one. People! You need to wake up! Our voting system is inadequate. We can audit trillions of dollars every year, but we cant audit 300 million votes (half of this voted in 2016). Not only is that stupid, but because we cant audit our votes we get less favorable legislation that effects us financially.This isn't a Trump issue! It is an issue altogether. These candidates dont want to fix it. They want to exploit it! I demand to see my vote before and after an election. Our votes should be audited by an independent agency so these goons cant touch it. I'm thinking they would only have to audit once after an election. The audit should be based off subjective math and available for all to read.	1

Chicago has very strict gun laws, but not Indiana just down the freeway. People drive to Indiana to buy guns and bring them back to Chicago. You do not need to take away guns in breach of the second amendment, just a few common sense laws. Do not allow guns at public gatherings and espcially demonstrations-- we saw all the guns at Charleston-- so many the Mayor said the demonstrators had more guns than the police. Guns were fired and shooters seen on video (shooter claimed they were blanks) and there easily could have been a mass shooting. In the Las Vegas shooting some band members and stage workers had guns, but were afraid to take them out because they thought they would be shot by the police and others with guns at the show (and the police agreed that could have happened). The Dallas shooting also had confusion over whether guys with guns were good or bad which slowed down the police because they could not initially identify the shooter with others carrying guns.	0

The State Department is in charge of the security and safety of its employees working in American embassies and consulates. The Ambassador begged for more security numerous times but he was ignored. The State Department depends on the host country to defend its citizens. If the host country can’t or won’t protect them, our military is usually sent in. They required orders from State or The Oval Office. The higher ups deny it but the troops anxious to rescue the Americans were told to”Stand Down”. No American help was sent while Hillary and Barrock slept that night. Why? Your take on Uranium One is equally as ignorant. Why do you protect these people? They don’t give a damn about you or the rest of us.	1
In 2015, China spent $144 billion on their military. Russia spent $66 billion.... This increase in spending - ON IT's OWN - is equal to ~80% of the entire annual Russian military expenditures. The U.S. already spent $596 billion in 2015 - so before the increase, the U.S. was spending nearly 3x the amount of those Russian and Chinese threats. Not so mention that staunch U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Israel, Austrialia, South Korea, and Japan spent a combined 316 billion - also more than Russia and China combined. The U.S. and it's closest allies (and there are many more not listed), spent many, many times over what Russia and China spent combined. You comment is asinine.	1

Everyday life is hardly ever theatre and that's why there are phrases like ""day of days"", in regards to writing, creating characters, etc. This play is masturbation.

"Politics affects most everyone's life. We deal with it in the office, in the news, and sometimes even in our homes. As a result, most people believe they understand it better than they really do (read: Dunning-Kruger effect). Not unusually, the most vocal tend to be the least informed. This often translates to those who are more entrenched in their political beliefs are more willing to shout down disagreement. I don't worry about being/becoming a ""dinosaur"" as independents and non-partisans make up roughly a third of the American voting populace. Though that ratio is a bit smaller here in Alaska, neither party has enough to win an election purely on their own base so they cannot run completely amok without worrying about accountability come vote day."	0

Everyone knows it is going upstairs for a ruling by the Supremes. Its actually a reasonable decision. The PFD is not a right. It was a product of Jay Hammond. The original one that was voted in gave $50 bucks for every year you were a resident. That was found unconstitutional as a result of a challenge by Ron and Penny Zobel in the early 80's by the U.S. Supreme Court. Today's amounts are based upon averaging over a period of time. As time goes on, the amounts are going to decline anyways due to continuing low prices. Blame the legislators for doing nothing. At least Walker did something. And he told everyone he would do it if the legislature didn't act. So who's to blame? Encourage your legislature to get our house in order, otherwise there won't be anything to distribute within a couple of years. I doubt there is another Exxon Valdez to jumpstart us out of a recession like last time. Call your legislator today and tell them to act otherwise soon there won't be anything.	0

"""Pensions are paid out of their savings,not a cent of pension is paid out of tax revenues."" 100% of the pension contribution is paid for from tax revenue, every last dime of it. All of teachers pension contributions come from their compensation package and their compensation package is entirely paid for using tax revenue. Both the ""employer paid"" and ""employee paid"" amount come from the same place (tax revenues) and is going to the same place (OTPP). Perhaps somewhat more concerning is that, because this pension plan is a ""jointly sponsored"" plan, the government is required, by law, to increase total compensation to teachers in the case of a pension plan shortfall."	0
How is this different? That's an easy one: it isn't a 'terrible disease or disability' to be a person who is transgendered; your comparison to diabetes is absolutely off the mark. According to Trump & the Trumpanzees, trans people's medical issues cost about 8.5 million per year to the U.S. military and as we should all know by now, that's about one-fifth of what's spent on Viagra, and less than half of what Trump has spent on trips to Mar-El-Largo and his other properties.	0
And the city of Eugene wants another $30 million to catch-up on deferred park maintenance and for more parks which will only add yet more maintenance needs. The county wants to renew the jail levy, and the state is looking for more money to close a $22 billion budget shortfall. I say we have enough parks. Forget about the new city hall and get caught-up on other city expenditures first. The county and state need to downsize their bloated adminstrative staff size and only fund basic services. The taxpayer is already tapped-out.	0

"F &M: "".What’s also notable is where the biggest change comes from in most of these polls….Trump’s overall ratings seem to be falling because some people who started off with a neutral impression on Inauguration Day have since soured on the president.

"Not sure what you mean by ""error factor"". If Gardiner (or any other player) makes a mistake that costs a goal, he gets a minus (so do all of his teammates on the ice at the time, of course). As for more critical minutes, if the difference were small, I'd agree. It's hard to put the difference between +21 and -15 or so down to critical minutes, though. Don't misunderstand me, I think Reilly is the better player and I was (very) surprised when I looked at the plus-minus."	0

Part II. OK, my analysis is that players 1 & 2 are roughly equal. More runs for P2, but more RBI's for P1. Higher AVG for P2, but more walks for P1. OPS difference is negligible. P3 stands out, though not greatly, because of Xtra base hits resulting in a higher OPS than the other two. If you couldn't guess, P1 = Goldschmidt, P2 = Blackmon and P3 = Arenado Add in Arenado's defense and you'd have to give him the MVP. Now if you don't completely disregard Coors numbers, I'd vote Blackmon. (Actually, I'd make he and Nolan Co-MVP's, but my glasses can be purple tinted at times) My prediction is the voters will either screw Charlie and Nolan outright because of Coors, or they will just cancel each other out by splitting votes. Either way I see Goldschmidt winning the MVP (sorry about the alignment, the underscores were supposed to prevent that . . .)	0

Since all businesses make mistakes, the mistakes [that is illegal behavior, not accidents] by Mylan and Wells Fargo are common and therefore at least partially excusable. 4. If the company practices an ""overall good"" then their illegalities are less serious than if the good/bad equation comes up short.

"I'd like to share a comment written in response to the article ""Clarity beyond clericalism: Bishop Long at the Royal Commission"" published in the Australian on-line journal ""Eureka Street."" The article elicited this response from one reader, who referred to Catholic schools: ""If there were a significant risk of abuse, then enrolments would have fallen off dramatically. They haven't... so I conclude this is a witch-hunt...and not a realistic assessment of any widespread problem."" To describe Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse as an unrealistic ""witch-hunt"" addressing a manufactured problem sounds bizarre to me.

Who cares? And why would we want to emulate those countries anyway?

Great letters from Walker and Crawford. The right in Alaska needs to be revealed in all it's oil sucking-up glory for what it really is: Bought and paid for employees of Big Oil. Always has been, always will be as long as Alaska is red. The fact that Alaskans fell for all the propaganda about SB21 is no big surprise; they're Republican and have been trained by their conservative parents and right wing propaganda to do the exact opposite of what is in their best interests, in favor of the ruling far right elite. Most telling, Alaskans thoughtlessly and stupidly voted for the biggest nut job and con man on the planet, Trump, for President. And now that he's continuing to be exposed as the destructive, corrupt, pathologically lying, bullying traitor that he is, they continue to support him. It doesn't get any more stupid than that.

"The whole scam of doctor incorporation so they can pay a 10.5% income tax rate is the REAL story here folks. The notion that some of these doctors are small businesses is complete and utter nonsense. As some have mentioned, many doctors employ ZERO people, pay ZERO overheard, have a captive customer base with ZERO risk of competition, ZERO risk in suffering loss of demand for their product or service, pay ZERO advertising dollars, and collect fees from the public purse. How in the world is that called a true small business? The ""ya but we doctors don't have pensions"" is such a lame excuse. Most private sector companies are reducing or eliminating pensions altogether. I hope that the Canadian public becomes more aware of this situation and demands fairness in the tax system.

Reminds of the meeting of one of the military officers bragging to a newly sworn President Carter of how quickly they could respond to any threat on a moment's notice. Carter, a former Naval officer, said GO!. The officer just stood there stunned as he was just told to show the president how prepared they were on a moments notice. Suffice it to say, he tried to initiate all of those paper plans, but it failed miserably. Nobody is ever ready. That is why the MAD(Mutually Assured Destruction) policies of Russia and the U.S. allowed both countries and the world to survive. Only an insane buffoon would even hint at any nuclear actions.

In fact, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming [3]."" http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/biodiversity/elements_of_biodiversity/extinction_crisis/"	0
For all its pomp and ceremony, this GLT20 seemed doomed from start. It may have had the potential to temporarily stave off the threat of a Kolpak exodus, but it hinged on a seriously lucrative broadcast deal, which realistically only Indian (and possibly Australian/English) networks would be able to provide. With no Indian players in the squad (no Australian players of note and only a handful of English players) coupled to a very successful IPL (and BBL and seemingly up-and-coming T20 Blast), where would the incentive be to pay out big money for broadcasting rights? And who, in their right minds, agrees to owners, coaches players, salaries, schedules etc. when you don't have the money to pay for this in your pocket already? CSA is competing with CA, the BCCI and WICB for being the most corrupt and/or incompetent cricketing board that is detrimental to the game without giving two hoots about their players. Sies.	1
The US Federal Government has little ability to prevent unauthorized entry to the US by land so a barrier of some sort on the southern border — where most illegal crossings occur — is a necessity. Visa overstays are another issue. States and localities declaring themselves sanctuaries merely enable illegal behavior. The Sonoma and Napa County fires were caused by a fire set by an illegal immigrant, Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who had been arrested and then released four times this year in Sonoma County, a sanctuary county. Federal authorities requested he be held but were denied. Something is wrong, folks.	0

You forget that that was a time that promised a brave new world, when the Arab Spring gave promise that in Arab countries at least despots such as Assad were to be swept away and replaced by western style democracy, That's why western democracies supported destabilizing and supporting rebel groups and his eventual eliminating.

Now we realize it was a foolish dream and Arab countries with their tribalism can never have democracy and need a strong man.

Time to get airlines, trucks, buses, barge shipping companies off the backs of the taxpayers. Highway users cover way less than one half of the total cost of the roads. Who pays the other half+ of the BILLIONS of dollars that it takes to build, maintain and repair the highways? Every single takpayer regardless of ownership of car or license. Who pays for the runways, taxiways, terminals, security, air traffic control, navigation systems and access highways to the airport? Every taxpayer in the USA while airline and other airplane operators pay token fees for rental space and use of the airfield. The total cost to the taxpayer is staggering! Locks and dams for barge transport is paid for by the taxpayer and barge operators pay a small fee for use. Why all these transportation experts have such a big problem with passenger rail but think it is just great to pour billing upon billions of taxpayer monies into other modes can only be explained if they are also on the user gravy truck.	0

CarGo does need to be more selective. He has almost always gone after low outside pitches---but he has also hit homers on golf swings. His defense remains gold glove caliber. I have a hard time imagining that he has lost it since late last year when he drove in 100 runs and almost hit .300 (but he didn't finish the season as strong). I wonder if being in the last year of his contract is a distraction for him. I think he really would like to stay in Colorado and my hunch is that he would do it relatively cheaply (regardless of his agent). I don't think he's washed up yet by any stretch.

"As a Native, I will say that America was tricked into Vietnam as the anglo oil companies in America coveted the South China Sea oil, just as America coveted Iraq's oil fields where the anglo oil companies were denied contracts that they got after Saddam was conveniently killed before he could blab about the CIA. If you look at the root cause behind 9/11, you will find America is attacked because of the $trillions of dollars worth of policies of colonialism America foists on countries worldwide, so the elite leeches and parasites who own the oil and mining companies can go in for free and make their billion dollar profits with the CIAs help. As a Native I see those same policies were used to slaughter Natives, in order for civilized Christians to steal the Natives resources and lands.

Thank goodness Austin Meeks is not the coach of the Ducks. Carrington was not dismissed from the team just for a DUII criminal arrest earlier this year. The Ducks gave Carrington many 2nd chances, and he continued to betray his teammates & coaches, as well as Duck fans. He did not play in the 2015 National Championship game, due to being suspended by the NCAA for failing a drug test. Could the Ducks have been National Champions that year, if he had been able to play? We will never know. Then later in September of 2015, he was arrested for violating Eugene's open container law, by drinking in public. He was given yet another chance to reform himself after that. Then in October of 2016, he got in a fight with an Oregon Alumni and Ducks fan, in which the man's arm was broken. Again, he got yet a third pass then. The DUII arrest this year was Carrington's 4th strike. This is very poor reporting by Austin Meeks. He is not viewing Carrington's dismissal in its proper context.	0

"Like the title, Prophetic Obedience, and what it conjures for my perception. Not convinced to read after review as it seems to delve into a lot of theological hair splitting. The concept of the ""People of God"" like ""We the People"" sought to invest authority within the common good of the masses rather than a select few men at the top. It remains fiercely resisted by the few men at the top, in church and state. Obedience linguistically has origins in ""listening to."" The collegial, democratic impulse is that servant-leaders listen to the people more than forcing the people to listen to them. The elites still distrust the masses to know what is good and good for them. Was it Freire who said not to capitulate ""that the masses are asses?"" Voices from below still struggle to have their voices heard. Paul VI's rejection of the birth control commission is currently exhibit A. The masses need to believe in their prophetic voice despite efforts from above to silence them."	0

This intangible concept to hard ass Hollywood types today is totally loss on them. The stories Freeman had were not outrageous gun battles where the body counts were important. He told stories that were some what relevant to the community here and on the mainland. The war veteran with what we now know as PTSD or the prisoner who marries his girlfriend and honeymoons at the expense of the State (Patty Duke episode) taken from the headlines of the day. So if someone in LALA Land (or Hawaii) thinks this series is about Hawaii, they are sadly delusional. For the tourist industry, it is a great weekly commercial to show our natural beauty, that all. They don't care if the show's actors were chimps. Hawaii and its people have something special, we generally all get along with each other. Listen to Beamers ""Mr. Sun Cho Lee""."	1

I heard a few clips of this um, er, ah speech on the way to work this morning. I highly doubt the standing ovation was for Trudeau, although he would think it was. More than likely it was for the kindness Canadians displayed during the tragic events of 9/11. Which by the way, Trudeau never mentioned was committed by radical Islam. This play was previously in Toronto and was created by 2 Canadians, yet Trudeau thought it wise to watch it in New York, wasting taxpayers money to be flown there along with his security detail and motorcade. But then we find out there were 150 UN officials there and Trudeau wants a seat badly on the UN security council, so it all becomes crystal clear. It's always about him and what he wants. He got to flirt with the UN, take credit for a film he had nothing to do with and get some selfies.	0

That's right, they don't make you sign a disclaimer. Maybe they should? Food injuries can lead to costly damage awards. Starbucks gave up 100K to a person who was burned, Micky-D paid 200K to a woman who burned her leg with hot coffee. The photos of her injury are truly shocking. Dumb accident? Certainly, but coffee hot enough to produce third-degree burns will also cause Barrett's esophagus, a terrible disorder that can kill you. That drive-through coffee is the worst. Sorry, I'd rather joke about this. Caveat emptor!	0
While I do not like Donald Trump, Ms. Clinton also has a checkered past as well as saying many ridiculous statements over the years.

Fish ladders were considered by the USGS prior to the 1968 decision to take the dams down. But the dams had many other issues. The Elwha river dam, constructed in 1910 ( rebuilt after partial failure in 1913) and the Glines Canyon dam completed in 1925 -6, were either not particularly well-engineered or antiquated. The Elwha dam's potential for failure was established when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission required Crown Zellerbach to obtain a safety report on Elwha and Glines Dams. The engineering firm retained by Crown Zellerbach studied the Elwha Dam and reported that it was unsafe, potentially subject to failure during high flood levels. Zellerbach contested the results, but a close look at how the Elwha dam had been fixed after the 1913 failure was more than alarming. Suffice to say the dam was seriously compromised. Retro-fitting fish ladders on a structures that were outdated, unsafe, and not built to seismic or modern engineering standards did not make economic sense.	0

This article bashes Trump and makes little allusion to the work that Gardner and other senators are actually doing. Let's move past the scare tactics that Ms. Farnan may have just copied and pasted from her progressive handbooks and talk about the actual facts about health care. The Affordable Care Act didn't lower premiums like they said it would. Health insurers are exiting the exchanges in droves and soon many counties will be without any option for health insurance. Look to the western slope for a homegrown example of the failures of Obamacare, not to mention the numerous regions in other states that have no insurance offerings on the ObamaCare exchanges. Medicaid is one of the biggest and fastest expanding program in our country, putting caps on the continuing expansion of it will help grow our economy and lend more money to other programs, like education and national security.	0

Well then looks even more like we need changes in the legislature in order to get revenue flowing again. Gridlock and obstruction is the tool of choice by Republicans who control the legislature at the state as well as national level and that will never change until they no longer have such complete control. A return to a bi-partisan coalition at the state level and doing away with the misuse of the filibuster in the US Senate will be a good start on legislatures that govern rather than rule.	0

Except for the inconvenience to the assigned dog, I think they should have let a K-9 unit go in and chew a little bit before using the pepper spray.

"What we have here is a baker who wishes to practice discrimination against gays, and he wants to claim that his ""Christian"" religion supports him. He is doing EXACTLY the same thing that racists in the days of Jim Crow did in refusing to serve blacks. I am vehement on this subject because I have a personal interest. My brother is gay, as are some of my closest friends. My mother's parents and other members of my family were killed by the Nazis because they were Jews. My daughter-in-law is African-American, and her grandfather was telling me about life under Jim Crow, stories that I believe explicitly. I have been raised to hate discrimination with all my strength, and I know what happens if it is allowed to go unchecked. It starts with ""No Dogs Or Jews"" and ends with Treblinka. In places like Chechnya, gays are imprisoned and killed. The Republican US Senate nominee from Alabama, Roy Moore, wants to do the same thing here. At least some people here seem to have no problem with it."	1

Correction: Walker hired Rutherford on Dec. 1, 2014 (not 2016 as stated above) after her prior tenure at the State as Dep. Commish ended in Dec. 2010. (In between, Rutherford managed Linc Energy Alaska projects w/for Corri Feige.) IMPORTANT NOTE: Rutherford held the same job title, DNR Deputy Commissioner, in 2010, when she left state employment and when Walker hired her back in 2014. $130,000= salary at time of Dec. 2010 end date. $184,000= salary as of today...end date unknown as she might still be on pay status (await clarification from Div of Personnel) How can Walker account for the $54,000 difference in salary when he promised during his campaign that he'd rein in those high salaries and then repeatedly told the public we'd all have to take cuts. Now he wants our PFD's to pay for his failed promises and inept skills to rein in salaries of his exempt, at-will, employees. Walker/Mallott's administration is rife with mismanagement, incompetency, and lack of accountability.	0

As a Christian, think we both agree radical religious terrorists are a blight at best and our world would be a much better place if they didn't exist.

Really? If by adults you mean the NYT Times and CNN pro Israel agenda to protect that country at any cost then yes you are correct For the better part of 6 years there has been fierce determination to drive a wedge between Russia and the US - (and Russia- Europe). When Trump signalled a desire to reconcile and perhaps work together (without recourse to war) these people you call adults would have none of that. The possibility that these interests manufactured the gas attack of last week to ensure that Trump would be forced to challenge Russia is there. There is still no conclusive evidence that either Russia or Syria is responsible - but ambiguity is the propagandists friend isn't it? So the US pushes further at the UN for access to Syrian air fields and failing that for more coercive strategies (look up Res 688 concerning the no fly zone over Iraq). Fortunately the G8 refused to impose more sanctions on Russia - with Germany leading the way. The US goal is clear - more war.	0

All principles are general and can be open to interpretation. On property rights, that essentially means one has the right to own, buy and sell property based on contract law and there are laws protecting it, but it does not mean one can do whatever they want with their property. If one's actions harm others than that is definitely a reasonable restriction on property rights and that applies to all rights. As for religious garb, I generally think women should be allowed to wear what they want where appropriate (A burqa in airport security or a bank is not appropriate), but at the same time some like the niqab and the burqa isolate one from society and more importantly Islam does not require women to wear them, only they dress modestly. In fact during the Hajj, burqa and niqab are forbidden so its more cultural than religious. In most majority Muslim countries you never see the burqa or niqab only is it common in a handful of them.	0

Sher-e-Hindustan: I have often wondered what your tag means. So, Britain and western Europe are the source of all racism and oppression in the world? Odd, then, that so many people are clamouring to come to western Europe and North America. There is little doubt that the reason for this is the culture and political systems of the West. We don't hear too much about anti-racism efforts in the rest of the world. Could it be because no other part of the world is trying so hard to eradicate that scourge? I agree that the history of the West is littered with examples of appallingly racist actions, including Canada. This makes the West no different than any others. What makes the West different is the attempt to make amends. You might balance your trashing of the West with recognising that.	0

You will insist that Trump was the force behind Obamacare repeal and ignore the massive years long Republican drive to do same? As a Republican candidate Trump could not just flush a religious tenet of the Republican leadership. He gave luke warm lip service and at the first opportunity discarded the repeal movement. Are you sure you are not a libber? Objective analysis suggests that if Trump wanted to repeal Obamacare, he would have worked with the Republican congress to continue refining proposals to until enough votes were obtained. He did not do that. Failure to objectively assess cause and effect marks a fanatic not a deep thinker. To say Trump is just incompetent ignores the successful life he has led. I know, just an accident and blah blah blah.	1

I agree with a 2 state solution. I agree with the settlements being an issue in moving forward. I disagree with Kerry and Obama and the UN. This was merely a personal conflict and dislike Obama and Bibi have for each other. Obama is not the statesman he wishes he was. His arrogance is beyond reproach. Kerry is foolish. For a just peace the Arabs (Hamas and Palestinians need to ensure there are no more bombing/ stabbings/ murder of the innocent...no more terrorism). Personally I do not believe that if Israel was to return everything there would be peace. The Palestinians and Hamas doctrine is to push Israel and the Jews into the sea. Look what happened when Gaza was returned. The Arabs were so foolish they destroyed everything the Israelis left behind, even high tech greenhouses worth a fortune. Then they statred lobbing bombs into Israel. I say give then back what they want and then if one incident occurs (Knifings/ bombings/ terrorism) do what needs to be done. Never again.	1

"This guy was an idiot but not a traitor. Those of you wishing to lynch him or suggest he is a traitor should examine a few historical facts. Former British soldiers and officers came over to the ""Americans"". We gladly accepted them. Were they traitors?

No matter which side you supported, half of the country would be traitors from the perspective of the other half of the country. Was General Lee a traitor?Senator McCain should rethink his comments about Sergeant Bergdahl. He will end up with a dishonorable discharge and pay for his stupidity many times over throughout his life."	1
Felix is a pathetic choice. He has shown himself as a zoning violator. What really is his expertise? Surely not urban mass transit. Mayor Kirk, please appoint someone with modern understandings of transit oriented development. If rail is to be completed, then a full analysis of the benefits is required. We are hearing about the costs, belatedly. It is possible that the economic benefits will outweigh the economic costs if TOD is factored in, and if TOD beneficiaries are taxed so that they pay for their enhanced property values. We really cannot go on with a choked freeway system. If you oppose rail, if you want to stop it, I hope you will take a ride out to Kapolei or Waianae someday in the early morning and look at the lines of cars at near standstill, a line which goes on for miles, from UHM all the way to Makaha. And the same is true up to Mililani. Stopping the project now does not make financial sense. We must futurize Oahu if we want to survive.	1

"Some people here will rail against any restriction on how nasty they can be in posts, claiming that this is simply free speech guaranteed by the 2nd amendment. But if someone downtown says, ""Hey buddy, spare change?"" the same people will show disgust for such behavior and demand laws to restrict that speech. First, this is private property. This space where we post is owned by the RG. That is why people have to pay to post. If people don't like that, they should start their own blog. The space downtown on the sidewalks is public space. Like it or not, as such, panhandling is free speech. Certainly harassment -verbal or physical - is not protected. But allocating police to patrol language seems to be a rather difficult problem. Are they going to cite someone for saying ""ahole"" and then have a judge sentence them? I do believe the U of O law seems to work. Why? And why is is Constitutional?

Perhaps he was confronted with a deep sense of humility regarding his humanness, or maybe just plain discouragement. Who knows! Maybe it was that ""poverty of spirit"" which the Holy Spirit has been known to make great use of. Many modern theologians don't seem to have much in the way of humility - but they still wish to control and rule others by virtue of their ""great intellect."" Compare our very brightest with God, who made the universe - they are like infants in comparison."	0

"Dennis, To be clear, you're absolutely right in that the species survives through procreation. That is ""the norm"" if you will. I'm pretty sure the species will survive, even if there's no church there telling us what to do, or not to do when it comes to sexuality. I ALSO think that if we focus on love, (and the stuff I talked about in my post), much of this will work out. What I mean by that is that by all accounts, being gay is not something ""contagious,"" or otherwise ""spreadable."" So whatever that normal/natural percentage of gays exist, that's not likely to change. I don't have answers, but I'm pretty sure that the church's teaching on human sexuality jumped the tracks a LONG time ago. Spreading a litany of prohibitions, fears, name calling, and discrimination does little to foster what's REALLY important in human relationships. And remember, it's DESIGNED to teach this to our kids. Today, we pay the price of that. I think the church needs to focus on something MORE basic."	0

But, since the stuff that gets rejected is typically name-calling, threats, and spam, I don't think it'd add much to the page. It's a common concern that people will vote down dissenting opinions; that's part of why we ask ""is this a *good* comment?"" first.

Chile though gives us a great case study of what happens in libertarian economics if you AVOID the feudalism turning into warlords and the degeneration into piracy (which is something that can happen when you have an absolute dictatorship). Company owners benefit when shares go up - which happens when huge profits are reported. So every CEO is incentivized to flagrantly lie and add a bunch of zeros to their financial statements. It doesn't happen very often because of two other factors. The first is taxes which is based on profit. Nobody wants to pay taxes on profits they didn't actually MAKE - it would cost more than you can gain from share-increases. The other is regulation. Regulation means people watching your company, and a high risk of getting caught if you cheat. The Enron scandal was just this - but they are very rare. In Chile they were not rare, since taxes were cut to the bone, and regulation removed. Every company did an Enron. TBC.	0

All you have to do is look at the voting records of the 20 largest cities in the United States and their populations and you'll notice that they would overwhelm the entire rest of the country in every election. I love my friends who live in big cities, but I don't think they should be in exclusive charge of the country's politics because, well, frankly, they're a bunch of elitist snobs who really like the government and think that anyone with a differing opinion should be jailed or shot on sight. And, yeah, I'm still friends with them because I allow people to hold stupid opinions if they want to, though I reserve the right to debate their stupid opinions and possibly dislodge them. Sometimes that works, but usually only if the person hold said stupid opinions moves to a rural area and begin the deprogramming of their citified mindset.	1

"Michael, with modern medicine only a small fraction of one percent of pregnancies put the mother's life in actual medical danger. The issue of a woman who was raped not being able to abort her unborn child is a separate, and difficult, issue, but the old adage of two wrongs don't make a right is still a true one. It's easy to be pro-choice to abort when one had the blessing to have been born alive and of having had a life since then, and I haven't met any pro-choice people who when asked if they could go back in time and talk with their mother when she was pregnant with them, would honestly say that they'd try to convince their mom of her ""right"" to kill them."	1

I attended every Pride from 1981 on the lawn at Hart House to last year's fiasco. . I have had great times and seen it grow from a little gathering on a lawn to the extravaganza it now is. But i always feared the destruction of Pride was inevitable when a bunch of angry dykes threatened to kick my teeth in for showing little pencil sketch of a female nude at a display of art at Hart House. The creation of the Dyke March, that segregated gay men out to benefit the lesbians was a slice of the pie too big. Even the change of the name from GAY Pride to merely Pride was to dilute the contribution of the men. What started as a celebration of gay or LGBT unity has become a power struggle where the gay men of Toronto are now classified as racist hate filled bastards who must be cast out. Yet, we are still expected to pay for it.	1
"A poll of Canadians on Supply Management? As useless as teats on a male bovine!

Being Canadians we'd probably say ""yes"" if the difference was 5 cents or more. As a country, we hate to see our fellow Canadians get ahead, and we love to hold them back.

You could have left out the 'dud for stupid people.' I know lot's a smart people who carry biased opinion because they never give credit to the opposition.  You did a great job dispelling the factual error, you don't have to be Perry Mason and humiliate the guy siting in the witness box. Is your goal to vanquish all enemies great and small, or to find a consensus that point's toward the truth for everybody? Be yourself, I'm just offering a suggestion. I completely understand the reaction to act 'in kind' to those who are foul and show no hesitancy to ridicule others.  Your persistant investigation and gathering of facts is welcome and that's what gives you real status!	1

"First off Nome, Alaska is hardly a typical Bush town. It is more like the Los Vegas of the North with a concentration of drinking establishments similar to what Fairbanks had back in the 50's and 60's. Nome is a white man's town. So let's write off Nome. But for most of the other villages the PFD is a major source of income for many families. It was wrong to get these residents hooked on this welfare check then yank it all of a sudden. Villages in general have no solid economic base. Most remote villages were built to benefit subsistence lifestyles. But that wasn't good enough for the white man. We built schools out there, sent in an army of middle class teachers, wired them for the Internet and cable TV all in order to assimilate the ""uncivilized tribes"" into the white man's cash economy. Now the problems persist that were created by trying to change people and their culture. They would have been better off if they had been left alone."	0

"I disagree, putting a slight, and it is slight, editorial slant on an obvious news story is a far cry from an editorial or opinion piece. The ""fake news"" claims are simply attempts by those of a certain political bent to manipulate and discredit the media when the stories don't match their own political narrative. While maintaining a critical eye is imperative, labelling something as ""fake"" when the story itself is true is intellectually dishonest."	0
you lib lunatics have no clue how the economy works! printing money CAUSES inflation you idiot! we dont do what obama did, as our system says no, we keep our money based on our value not some phony scam you endorse. and the economy was not resurrected by obama it was held back for years under the longest recovery and with the fewest jobs created in its history! and as for the surplus see ignorant sheep, when you CUT spending vs revenus you have a SURPLUS , it was real, get over it.	1

"Hi Larry you raise 100% legitimate points. But I suspect a similar question was originally raised of Messianic Jews. The first step was to try and divorce biblical Judaism of the Torah from later Judaism of the Talmud. Then Messianic Jews could distinguish what was is really a religious issue and what is a cultural one. The same with Islam. Many things we associate with ""Islamic"" are actually manifestations of Arabian culture, or the later Haddith, and not the religion of the Qu'ran. So a Messianic-Muslim shouldn't, for example, feel obliged to where a Burkha. And funny you mentioned head dress. The only religion with explicit commands about wearing head dresses is Christianity, in 1 Cor 11. Yet we explain those texts away today don't we? Muhammed was a deeply flawed person - but any more than OT prophets? His fundamental message was for Arabians to abandon paganism and worship the God of Abraham. Judge him by his time and place, not ours."	0
"My opinion, for what it's worth, is that Kim's nuclear missiles are a bid to join the big boys in the nuclear crowd. Would Kim use them? I don't think so, what would it get him, besides annihilated? Kim is like Trump, using power and bluster to energize his base. We have millions of idiots among our voting citizens who chanted ""Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran"" at McCain rallies. We have had demagogues since 1950 who wanted to nuke Korea, Vietnam, Iran and other places. We haven't done that and they haven't bombed us. A nuclear exchange would be hard to stop short of planetary annihilation. Given that, and that so many second-rate nations have nuclear weapons, we should mostly ignore North Korea. It's a horrible place to live for most of their people, who are literal slaves. But there is little we can do about it without great cost in life and treasure to millions of people. Let's say North Korea landed a 20 kiloton nuke on Guam. Should we incinerate Pyongyang? I would say no."	0

It is inappropriate; if you are in contact with average middle-class Americans you would be aware how our insurance went up--either directly or indirectly because of this forced-on-us program.

"I've tried responding to Kathleen's ""states rights"" argument twice now, and been zapped into the dreaded 'UNCIVIL ZONE' both times. Since I'm marking everyone else's posts as 'good'/'civil' no matter who they are or what they say (even Kathleen's!) because I refuse to be ADN's unpaid censor, I think that's a little unfair. There may be no 'civil' way to present certain ugly truths, but I'll nonetheless keep trying. Invoking “states’ rights” was the Ku Klux Klan's tactic for perpetuating Jim Crow laws. And the only HONEST ‘anti-abortionist’ I ever heard speak was former Grand Dragon and current Aryan Resistance leader--and TRUMP SUPPORTER--Tom Metzger of Falbrook, CA. When once asked his position on abortion, he said: “We oppose abortion for white women. We are in favor of abortion for non-white women.” That's the TRUE position of these overwhelmingly white ""anti-abortionists."" But unlike Metzger they don’t have the guts to admit it. That includes 'Trumpy the Clown'."	1

Mountain biking is a great sport, and it's made up great people...although this person is making crazy generalizations that make them sound like a bunch of rude misfits. This is more insane than the crazy people that tried to ban surfing along the beaches around San Diego in the '50s. Really? At least those surfers really could be labeled as ""misfits""...as if that even matters. The bikers here in Anchorage are firefighters, engineers, attorneys, doctors, lawyers and other big contributors to society. And, I'm positive that the vast majority of mountain bikers here are quite knowledgeable about wildlife. You're entire argument is nuts."	1

Since they reflexively vote republican no matter the names of the candidates, the majority of Alaskans have the government they deserve; the rest of us...not so much. Too many Alaska republicans think there's absolutely nothing wrong with oil industry employees in the legislature making decisions on oil taxes and credits. Too many Alaska republicans think its just fine for conservative legislators to use the power of government to force their religious beliefs on the rest of us. And too many Alaska republicans who are now complaining about state government have been voting for the same people over and over again for many years. According to these republicans, its never the people they voted for that are the problem, its all the people that everyone else voted for.

You are correct about disinformation and who controls the message. Also look hard at the IPCC with their alarmist cries based on over a hundred computer models that are continuously adjusted each year because the earlier dire projections never came to reality. We were told 2 decades ago that we had to find a CO2 solution in 10-15 years or the world was at the tipping point that we couldn't reverse its downfall. All that has happened is the world is much greener resulting in increased food production for a growing world population. The IPCC should also not be trusted. What about Mann's Hockey Stick scam they base all their alarmism on, the 97% consensus which was a scam developed by Illinois graduate students, referencing bloody hiking magazines as legitimate scientific data, and trying to destroy the careers of incredibly gifted scientists like Chris Landsea who have data and theories that contradict (and have been proven correct) the IPCC' cult's message?	0

Projection, Carl V. Peterson. You project upon me a mean character, maybe to make you feel better about yourself, at least in relation to your mental construct of what I am. You and I live in the same world, Carl. It is our perception of it that differs. Most drivers on interstates are courteous and cooperative, more or less. Lane blocking, that is, driving parallel to another vehicle at the identical speed for miles at a time, might be just mindless, or thoughtless. Maybe you think it odd that I find things to think about while driving long distances? But one thing I attribute to others, as a default situation, is conscious volition. Maybe I shouldn't do that? At the least, getting in the way of others is rude, and doing it for pleasure is certainly a mild type of mental illness, a pointless infliction of pain. You don't go out of your way to do things like that, do you, Carl? You went out of your way to tell me off, though. There's a lot of that sort of rudeness on the internet.	0

Stay on topic, Rule and Raven. We're not talking about sanitizing anything. We're talking about a priest who used sacred human remains to endorse a political candidate, this not even a few days after the Vatican issued specific directions as to how those remains should be honored and respected. In the course of his political action, Father Pavone has managed to be rejected by two of the more political archbishops our nation has known, but I bet he keeps his donors. But as long as you bring it up, read all four Gospels. The sufferings of Jesus are recounted in as few words as possible with no graphic detail at all. The Evangelists didn't sanitize the crucifixion. They proclaimed it as Good News. Crucifixes are an artistic statement, and the nature of that statement has been different in various places and times. For what it's worth, I think the crucifixes in every church where I've served have been quite beautiful and edifying.	0

“The two leaders connected very quickly,” Tillerson said. “There was a very clear positive chemistry.” Of course they did, they've been friends for years.

I was all for legalization for years. After reading the Liberals new proposed law I am actually worried things will be made worse for pot smokers with this legislation. The part of the law that worries me the most is the inspectors who can get a quick warrant by phone and then enter your home to make sure you aren't growing more than 4 baby plants. Not to mention the changes to roadside check stops that force you to give a swab test for THC (there is no accurate test at this time) followed by mandatory blood tests. These swab and blood tests can also be used to log your DNA. At this point I almost want the government to just back away and leave the laws as is. This was the one thing I actually supported Trudeau on but he can't seem to get anything right. Matthew De Grood the psychotic murderer got more out of hospital privileges in Alberta today, 3 years after murdering 5 people. Get caught selling pot to a minor with this new legislation and its a possible 14 years in jail.	0

If you pull up the cross street of highway 524, York Road, and 39th Ave SE it will make COMPLETE sense. Right there is a Church at the Corner of York RD and Highway 524.	0

"A person with a spouse and two children making $20/hour full time still qualifies for Section 8 housing offsets the maximum income for that example being $41,850. The cost of a $20/hour full time employee with associated taxes and mandatory benefits far exceeds $800/week. According to many here employers should be providing a ""Living Wage"" (a sum they usually don't define) as if a business owner has unlimited funds from which to draw. There are occupations that merit $20/hour and more but those which are associated with Minimum Wage are not among them."	0

These players are a joke . The very fact they have high paying jobs just to play a game shows America is a country that gives everyone a chance to be the best they can be and is a country to be proud of . Since they have the right to take a knee---does that mean I have the right to use the N word any time I want ? I'd never do that since it would be disrespectful to them---just as they are being disrespectful of the very country that puts the food on they're table . The NFL has clear cut rules that tells the players they must stand while they are on the job . The second they enter the arena they are on the clock . Why doesn't the NFL enforce it's own clear cut rules ? I'm one of those who will change the channel when games come on until these over paid players stop disrespecting America . And in other news---last week footage was shown of a youth football team made up of about 10 years old's . The kids took a knee . What are the odds they're black coaches were behind it ?	1

Don't forget to add that she is also a pathological liar. Look at her track record of blatant lies and then saying she misspoke. I think Trump is a buffoon and I'm ashamed that someone like that can become President of the United States, but HIllary lost the election because of her character. Really she has no character and will do and say anything to push her agenda. If you say she has character, please point out the benevolent things that she has done.

"RC - I doubt there are any ""progressive Catholics"" who are accepting of the LGBT community who think gay priests, brothers and sisters should NOT come out publicly. Whether that is safe at this moment is another question. As a Catholic community, we still maintain for church men and women the closet which lay people are increasingly escaping because their rights are legally protected. Our church men and women are not protected in these way and they can have their lives torn apart if a parish or diocese or blog decides to go after them for leaving the closet, even as celibate gay men or women. When people come out, even in celibacy, allies tend to say ""oh great! She is comfortable with being who God made her to be"". Others seem to say, ""we need to watch that guy to be sure he doesn't get out of line/break his vows/come on to me/recruit my kid/corrupt the parish/etc."" When that stops, maybe more church men and women will come out publicly."	1

"Argil C. Jeffery So clearly you have no problem with Obama having a third nominee on the court who will swing the court HARD HARD HARD left for the next 25 years. A hard left SCOTUS can nullify pretty much every Constitutional protection for rights that exists. It can assure that when this current generation of justices finally retire from the court, there will be nobody left who remembers what the Bill of Rights even says. If the SCOTUS were not a political body or if justices retired after a decade or two, or if there were 15-25 judges instead of just 9, it might not be so bad, but when you have an extreme ideologue like Obama (who has ignored half the country's electorate in order to achieve his unconstitutional ""legacy""), the Senate has an obligation to act as a check and balance against his tyrannical behavior. I know, if you are far left yourself, it doesn't seem that way, but for those of us who care about liberty and our right to live our own lives, it matters. A LOT!"	0

Same here. The more people outside the U.S. think like this, the more that country will start feeling the pinch. This has got to be hurting its tourism industry quite badly: hotels, airlines, restaurants, theme parks and other attractions, etc. I would like to see some surveys on that, to see whether this emerging international boycott is starting to have an impact on the U.S. economy. If there is clear evidence that they are starting to feel some pain as a result of Trump's ridiculous antics, I would bet that a good many of his supporters might begin to see the light and join the ranks of those people who are already clamouring for impeachment of this dangerous clown.	1
I know it's become fashionable to hate this guy, but is it fair? He personally created this highly technical company. It has distributed about 80 billion Rands in very small packages in a huge number of locations in a generally secure and auditable fashion.The total profit recently reported for these activities was just over one billion. Just over 1%. Now just think what would have happened if this deal had been Zupterised - those guys, as we learn, deal in profits of 20%.

I agree on the re-test. I've had my ODL since 1962 and the only 'test' I've had to take since is an eye test.

That would get us old fogies off the road if we're incapable without our kids having to turn us in to DMV.	0
When the liberals first entered into the solar market (98c cents/KWH if I remember correctly) members of the German government told them they were drastically overpaying and actually likely do damage the solar panel market by supporting such a high price. We are now on the hook for a series of twenty year contracts ranging from that price down to some 28 cents/KWH. Bear in mind none of these prices include delivery just production. They have driven many high paying metals processing jobs out of the province and caused all businesses and in turn consumers unwarranted price hikes.Their next big thing is carbon Cap & Trade starting in January, is everyone ready for a hike in pretty much everything else they consume? They need to in the very least defer Cap & Trade. They say you get the government you deserve, let's not vote them in again.	0

On his radio show in 2009, Rush Limbaugh repeatedly questions whether or not Obama is a U.S. citizen. Obama finally has enough of Limbaugh’s criticism and lashes out against the radio host on an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Look, I think Limbaugh needs to focus on more pressing issues, such as the Rogaine treatments for his hair loss, because they’re clearly not working.” Obama’s wife Michelle later laments in a TV interview with Oprah about the level of viciousness from the right against their family. Did this really happen — NO!!! But dollars to donuts if it DID happen the right (including Trump himself) would be apoplectic. And, guess what, they would be correct to be upset, because Obama would be behaving in a way that demeans the presidency. However, the fact that Trump's followers don't see this as wrong when their own guy behaves this way is what’s troubling.	0

I stand corrected. The Habs do not have to protect Andrei Markov as one of their three protected defencemen for the expansion draft because he is a UFA. The Habs can leave him unprotected on the June 15th deadline, and then re-sign him. It does leave him exposed, true, but it is unlikely he jumps ship. He's 38, but having a very good year. He's better at 38 than Beaulieu, Petry, Benn, Emelin etc. Sign him at a slight discount: 2 yrs. $10 mil Of note last night, Galchenyuk played 11:50 minutes as a winger, and not a peep from the rabid Habs crowd post game on their boards. If that had happened under a certain coach recently departed, viva la revolucion! It would seem that Mr. Julien is still in his honeymoon phase, turning the team around, tightening up the defence, Carey Price has come to life, playing smarter, secondary scoring.

"Isabella, don't take the promotion now. The most precious years are when the kids are tiny, and the bond formed then is the most important one in life. If you are being offered an executive promotion now, decline with thanks and explain your situation.

On the other hand, well thought out action on the environment can make us all better off, both in standard of living and in quality of life. For instance, I think that electric cars, either battery or fuel cell, would materially improve everyone's quality of life by eliminating the noise and fumes even the cleanest, best muffled internal combustion engines generate. If my electric bill could be reduced by reasonably priced solar cells on the roof, my standard of living would improve by a little bit. I'm sure you can think of many other examples.	0
Would the answer then be exactly ZERO? Canada has seen a ZERO reduction in GHG emissions under successive liberal governments. But..but...how can that be? We sign symbolic agreements, we speak in flowery rhetoric, we intensely castigate anyone who doesn't immediately fall in line, we tax, we transfer wealth, we send massive contingents to ceremonies, we speak more flowery rhetoric, we blame others on the other side of the political spectrum, etc... But you mean, liberal governments in Canada have NOT reduced GHG emissions at all? Nothing?  Gasp...this must also be Trumps fault!	0

"Election campaigns need attention grabbing advertising and the ""Just Not Ready"" commercials were effective at first because they were attention grabbing and obviously true. (No serious person not in the tank for the Liberal Party could rationally argue that Trudeau 2.0 had the requisite education, experience, intellect and accomplishments to lead a G 7 nation.) But by the leaders debates these commercials had worked too well! Expectations of Trudeau's campaign performance were so low he was able to exceed them and this plus the desire for change in the 60s led to victory. Obviously, we have no space to debate the campaign in detail. But what annoyed me most was the brazen way the Liberals took things out of context to deliberately mislead the voters. Comparing Harper`s economic performance vs PMs from 50 and even 70 years ago was a brazen con job. The meaningful comparison would be with the other G7 and G20 leaders in this global economy. Harper was THE star in this."	0

"""how do we get there from here?"" In my mind, that is the question that every living soul has a responsibility to at least think about. I realize that's not going to happen, That's disappointing, but I have no control over that. But I do have some control over and certainly responsibility for what I do. The violence, injustice, and cruelty that is a large part of this country's (and the world's) history is a fact. That history should not be forgotten, it can't be changed, it happened. But life exists in the ""present"". A life largely shaped by the past, but in the present nevertheless That is an undeniable, physical fact. And that is where the ""change"" must take place in. It's the only place where change can possibly take place. Getting back to the question of ""how do we get there from here?"" First, it has to start with, how do ""I"" get from here to there? Not trying to get too philosophical/metaphysical here, just trying ask the right question so as to possibly ""make it happen""."	0

Vladimir Lenin once said Capitalists would sell him the rope used to hang them - an indication that nothing mattered but money to western leaders. Certainly that's true of this columnist. Who cares if China is a ruthless, brutal dictatorship running one of the most corrupt nations on earth? Not McKenna. There is no private business in China which is not controlled in one way or another by the Communist party. And because of that influence business in China and all of those who run them are thoroughly and completely corrupt in every aspect. That includes lying about anything and everything which could profit them including falsifying their books and the ingredients in any products they market. And of course, bribing foreign leaders as a matter of course. Simply look at all the money being funneled into the Liberal Party of Canada by Chinese-Canadian businessmen, who are clearly demonstrating their continuing fealty to China and their eagerness to carry out its bidding.	1

"If you believe in the Christian God and the 10 Commandments, the ""Thou shalt not kill"" is the Commandment that is hotly debated by the USA's abortion laws. Science says that life begins at conception. The liberals say that life begins when the baby's head pops out of the birth canal. Who is right? The Bible, the Christian God's word, like the USA Constitution, is being interpreted by scolars and sometimes idiots that ""think"" what the founding fathers meant in writing the Constitution and what the Christian God meant when he inspired his followers to write the Books and the Bible.

"I only had to read a few lines to realise that the author is entirely missing the point. Nobody, and let me emphasise that, is suggesting that people of colour are innately disposed to committing sexual offences. The (legitimate) concern is that a large percentage of migrants or refugees come from poor countries where women are not afforded the same rights of levels of respect when compared to men. Cultures where women, particularly Western women, are reduced to submissive objects of sex. You see, it's people like you who actually make this problem worse - you stifle any real debate surrounding the issue by immediately condemning it as ""racist"". We can't talk about high migrant crime rates without some idiot calling us intolerant, thinking they are being really clever and progressive in the process. It is the opposite; by reducing this to something so simplistic as ""race"" you are doing a disservice to both migrants and host populations. We need to be able to discuss this openly."	1

In July of 2016, an avowed black nationalist murdered five police officers during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Dallas, Texas. The act of violence was well-planned and was motivated entirely by the hate-filled ideology of the shooter, Micah Xavier Johnson. With several officers dead by the hand of a committed black nationalist, one might think the Obama administration may have considered the assassinations domestic terror and launched an investigation into groups associated with this ideology. Not at all. Barack Obama condemned the shootings, but he did not call out or even allude to Johnson’s hateful views. He did, however, blame “powerful weapons” for the violence. Hypocrisy from MSW, progressives and the wonderbra media. Who would have thought it?	1

I would add that immigration expense last year cost the government 2.5 billion dollars directly. It has been found to cost taxpayers as a net, 23 billion dollars annually because our new immigrants are not doing so well so pay less in tax than they receive in benefits. If you add in all the unemployed that could be employed if immigration levels were reduced, the overall cost of immigration to Canadian taxpayers is probably around 30 billion dollars a year. Reducing immigration levels is fiscally sound policy.	0

It's quite reasonable for discount brokers to expect and to receive some payment/recompense for the sale of third party products.

The only large bank discount broker that fails to provide on line purchases of GICS, likely to be a more attractive option in the near future, is TD Direct Investing. I assume that TD Direct Investing does not want clients to buy lower margin and illiquid investments. Far better for clients to be buying and selling IPOs on a regular basis.	0

"I suggest that journalists stop using the word ""mutation"" for these kinds of stories, as it is misleading. Just use ""gene"". Mutations are not necessarily bad, sometimes they're quite good, and most frequently they go unnoticed. We all have an average of 60 mutations in our genome that came from neither our father nor our mother. We have countless more that were passed onto us by ancestors. Our entire genetic structure is due to billions of years mutations and natural selection, as the environment selected the most advantageous traits based on which organisms lived and died. So to say that someone altered genes of a human embryo to fix a mutation isn't false, but it's also misleading as it implies that mutations are always bad. Fix what mutation? The blue-eyed mutation? The Huntingtons mutation? One of the many mutations that gave us opposable thumbs? One of the many mutations that seemingly have no effect? Just use gene."	0

I am happy to tell you, David Clark, that increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is a direct cause of atmospheric warming. That increasing CO2 concentration is the result of carbon combustion by humans, and not the result of rising atmospheric temperatures. This is so obvious that it requires no proof. Furthermore, a minimal amount of internet research will show you that the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere following relatively cold periods has risen over millennia, not in a matter of 3 centuries of human coal burning. You have been reading junk science, and you have hoodwinked yourself.	1

"""Even women""? The author does not consider the possibility that honorable young men today have no wish to join a misogynist organization. They do not approve of such. ""Priesthood and religious life were taken off their pedestals"" by Vatican II? Hardly. Vatican II spawned a previously unheard of emphasis on an ""in persona Christi"" priesthood, where the priest is elevated as a Jesus-representative, and acts ""in the person of Christ."" The basis for this ""in persona"" clericalism was the Vulgate translation of 2 Co 2:10 which has since been superseded by the Catholic NAB/NABRE Bible to read ""in the presence of Christ,"" not in the person of. A Vatican house of cards now without a foundation. We do not need 'divine' priests or 'infallible' popes. It would be a sin to increase the discrimination and misogyny in the Church for the convenience of making more priests, while barring women and LGBT. Jesus said, ""Do this in memory of me,"" to all disciples present, both men AND women. Equal rites."	0

I'm glad to see money allocated to fixing a high traffic yet terrible stretch of Territorial so-called highway. Over the years the whole of Territorial has been a death trap with its narrow lanes, lack of shoulders, blind curves, sinking grades, and roller-coaster straights. Its traffic has at least doubled in the last decade, and likely will continue to grow. Territorial gets heavy log and gravel truck traffic making it a particularly high-maintenance road, and so I'm not sure the county really wants it. It has been surveyed for several years now; this feels like another delay. Five more years while the state pours more money into an ox-cart road!	0

This is an historical pattern. Nothing new. High hopes, followed by second thoughts and eventually panic when people begin to realize their horrible error in judgement. Trump may well bring back jobs to the USA but it will mean a higher cost to manufacturers and thus lower profits. Ticking off all the countries that America sells to will eventually lead to closed markets and their own tariff walls. Exports will fall, there will be massive layoffs and the US economy will start to sink. He will undo everything Obama succeeded in doing in recovering from the Bush disaster of 2008. New alliances will be formed all around the world that do not include the USA. When countries around the world realize they no longer need the USA, the American economy will sink like a rock.

I’ve not reviewed this latest report from ISER - but as with many ISER impartial, thorough data-driven analytics, I’m sure it’s both informative & fairly dense - presenting options rather than table-pounding conclusions - I’ll read it during breaks as I prepare for summer “House-guests From Hell”! But I will pound the table for my own 5 conclusions: 1. More budget cuts are inevitable OVER TIME- But too many cuts all at once will only cause a HUGE recession to add to our woes. We need revenues too. 2. The proposed 01,5% income tax is quite small – before oil we had an income AND a school tax, Most working Americans pay State income AND sales taxes. And we are already cutting the income of the poorest Alaskans with PFD cuts. 3. Cuts to oil incentives MUST accompany income taxes & PFD cuts. 4. We should use the above + interest from PFD investments to fund government services. 5. We should use the PFD system to provide VERY direct & efficient, useful services to Alaskans (see below)	0

This series loss is on the offense. People want to murder the Rockies because they lost consecutive road games to two starters with sub 3.50 ERA's, but I'm not going to do it. They were pathetic on Monday, fought hard and lost last night. ESPN says Bridich is trying to acquire Jonathan Lucroy from Texas, so let's hope he gets it done. I'd prefer a bullpen arm, but I'm guessing there's too much competition for those and Bridich doesn't want to have to part with too many of his precious prospects. I just hope the Rockies don't go 0-6 on this trip--they really need to win tonight.	1

". Judah: I agree with your assessment of Ohio Dan. But, of course, it doesn't take cojones to stand up to Trump & McConnell & the GOP's ""leaders"" -- it just takes a spine. .

P.S.: While Senator Susan Collins won't waiver under future threats (or career-advancement promises) from Mr.T, from GOP ""leaders"" or from Koch superPAC$, I have no such confidence in Murkowski. Her history & duplicity strongly suggest that her #1 goal will always be to promote her personal political ambitions No Matter How Much Deceit It Takes every 6 years. Her sense of entitlement can override any trace of ethics & any unlikely impulse to speak w/o her usual platitudes & doublespeak when campaigning here as a pretend-independent."	1

"You're welcome. You also. I get it now - there are no accusations from women indicating that it was anything other than a very vulgar boast. I disagree that there have been no accusations. His wife Ivana stated that he raped her in a rage, but she then withdrew the accusation, a pattern common in abused women. There are many other complaints from women, and I think there is more than enough evidence to indicate that Trump's bragging was not merely empty talk. As someone with a degree in psych, and many years of working with victims of abuse, Trump is a poster child abuser. He has an abundance of behaviors, including his display of ""narcissistic injury"" (vicious lashing out, casting himself as the victim) whenever criticized or even questioned about his behavior, that show me he is a practiced, serial abuser of women. I'm as sure as I can be without witnessing it for myself that Trump's comments were anything but empty bragging."	1

Which would work 100% against the prosecution - if past 'victims' make an allegation, but the fact pattern is different than the mode, plan, common scheme, or absence of mistake than how the current alleged victims describe his actions, the empty allegations bolster Vasquez's defense. The prosecutors are looking for a uniform M.O, victim profile, or other specific acts that don't vary, or simply that are not tangential to other allegations. If his defense is predicated on false accusations, then the more that any other number of 'accusers' who offer a different narrative come forward, that's just more and more Brady evidence for Vasquez. Every charged act must stand on its own merits, irrespective of any other charges or even mere allegations. This is the time where prosecutors are biting their nails that your theory (a poor one) doesn't become their reality. If they convict him on these 3charges alone, he never sees the light of day again, certainly not as a sex offender in Colorado.	1

We retired last summer to Arizona. My wife taught 25 years for ASD. Moving here, we were shocked how little Arizona pays teachers, and offers even less respect. The governor here declared in his state of state address, that they were going to give teachers a huge raise. He said look for our budget announcement the same week. The announcement was made as promised. The raise? It was 4/10ths of one percent. Teachers were insulted. After negative feedback they are considering a $5000 raise. Even with that raise, teachers in Arizona will still be around 49th in pay nationwide. And they will only give the raise if voters approve an additional sales tax. We have thousands of vacant positions here that will never be filled. Class sizes are 40 or more. Some districts can't give any raises, so they offer a 4 day school week as an enticement. Why Alaska's politicians and educrats at the school district offices don't get it is surprising. Learn from other states mistakes. Before it's too late.	0

Interesting. I recently had a discussion with my grand-daughter who is shortly going to be heading off to university to study business. I explained to her that in the 'olden-days' people who went off to university to become educated were supposed to go into it with a broad focus and an open mind. A Liberal Arts program used to be one of the hardest to enter and finish because the everyone was expected to study philosophy, languages, history, AND science and math. Basically any educated person was expected to be well grounded in each of these areas. Only after this did you go off to study your specialty. Now people in STEM programs are still are required to study outside of their specialized fields with mandatory courses, but for some reason it is the Liberal Arts faculties that decided to water down their programs and take out all of the 'hard bits'. What good is a teacher, lawyer, or a diplomat who is illiterate in STEM (all that they have nowadays are the 'soft skills').	0

What the PM did was not right, ntl. From the announcement of the imminent settlement, the settlement, the immediate payout, the different justifications provided- suggesting damage control, attacking Opposition MPs, and linking a threat to NAFTA for articulating opposition to the settlement. The PM did not have to settle. he did not have to do this just before NAFTA negotiations. He could have let the courts decide. The rapidity of this botched effort at decision making has angered Canadians, and most concerning to the PMO, it has angered most Liberals.

"Another view of Krugman's federal health insurance idea: ""Before 1950 flood insurance was part of the standard homeowners' insurance policy. During the 1950s increasingly high correlation of losses by holders of flood policies of the same company caused many insurance companies to begin excluding flood coverage from standard insurance policies, selling flood insurance separately. Over time, insurance premiums collected were insufficient in covering payouts after major flooding events. In the 1960s flood insurance became completely unprofitable and private companies no longer offered flood insurance policies."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Flood_Insurance_Program Krugman should start by putting cost estimates with all of his grand fixing ideas, but why do that when the ""government"" is the one footing the bill? Sometimes I wonder if Krugman was really ever an economist?"	0
So why was there no black people at this festival? Were they not allowed to come? You 'assume' it is due to invisible barriers and the like. I would suggest if they had an interest in the material and the will to be there they would...no one is stopping them. And why do you leave out other races and cultures?  And how come there is not a truly successful black country? I know that is soooo unacceptable to say, but I will say it anyways. People flock to what were originally (leaving out the FN argument for a minute) white countries and then we are made to feel bad because there is not immediate acceptance etc. Of course if the situation was flipped and white people had to flock to originally black countries to succeed we would be accepted and there would be no intolerance. Yeah right. We all have inborn bigotry and perhaps good ol whitey is sick of the hypocrisy. In my house ALL are welcome and accepted, just leave your victim-hood at the door...after all it is 2017.	1

"- continued response 9) ""But it was the Union that instructed its members not to report to work"" - If you don't know a union is setup, here is how it works. The fact is it was our individual members that voted to go out on strike. Over 90% of the men and women affected voted to go out on strike. It was only after that vote the international came in to support the decision that We the working people made. The ""Union"" has come in and provided a food bank, provided information on getting members discounted healthcare, and provided support in general for any member that needed a hand up 10) ""Alutiiq has a strong and positive relationship with organized labor at military installations across the US."" - This may or may not be true.

As a supporter of individual liberty and John Stuart Mill, I agree with some of SRazorwire's points, but not all. I didn't have the time nor space to get into the semantics of this particular debate, I do have a job and family. I will say this though, the issue is not as black and white as portrayed here. Once we acknowledge that all ideas and beliefs are subjective, we realize that to reach a consensus, we must first engage in a dialogue as to what we, as Canadians, believe are our core values and beliefs, and those don't just get to be the status quo, they must be debated and open to change over time and inclusive of all views.	0
We're not in California. And it's still ILLEGAL to release domesticated animals into the wild, and under some circumstances it's legal to shoot said domesticated animals when they're seen harassing or harming wildlife. I interpret the relevant municipal ordinances and state regulations according to the reality that an unrestrained invasive feline is by DEFINITION harming and harassing wildlife. The mere presence of a cat is sufficient to induce wild birds to abandon their nests. That's harassment by any standard. And I will act in accordance to my interpretation of the law and my own conscience and understanding of good wildlife stewardship. Be advised--TNR is illegal in Alaska. The purpose of my article is to see that it stays that way, and further to induce our political leaders to rigorously enforce the law as it stands. Have a nice day.	0

This is the inevitable result of decades of designed regression towards the stupid. The anti-education, anti-science, anti-knowledge movement in this country is gathering momentum. It's time to call religion out as the gateway drug to magical thought and irrationality that produces inanities like flat-eartherism, climate denial, anti-vaxxers and the myriad other absurd, counter-factual conspiracies that people cling to. Belief in things in the absence of proof (whether it be gods, UFO's, or conspiracies) is ascribed equivalent or greater value than the acquisition of knowledge, use of the scientific method, or rational, skeptical assessment.	1

City council is currently working on the budgets. They were told by their attorney yesterday that they are allowed to put city funds in for rail construction. All that's needed is a simple proviso that states they're amending the current ordinance. It's important to understand that real property taxes go into the general fund along with many other fees, so the thing to look for on the rail funding is the source of those funds.	0

Ivanka, Jared Have Third Email Account, and Another Private Server At Trump Tower Kushner, Ivanka and other top officials in Trump’s orbit were told not to use private email, were reminded by the NSA not to use private email, and had just wrapped up a campaign based largely on falsified hysteria over a government official’s use of private email, so there is no excuse. There is Trumpist/Republican hypocrisy though.	1
So we should live in a world where Russia, China, Pakistan, North Korea (soon) and Iran (soon) have nuclear weapons and we don't. It is possible that if we disarmed unilaterally, these other countries would see the error of their ways and follow our example. But if I were a betting man.... While we're on an apology tour, don't forget the firebombing of Dresden, which required no nuclear weapons. Also, you might want to remove the statue of Air Marshal (Bomber) Harris in London.	0

believe voter apathy is the main reason for low voter turnout; not the process. making the process easier does help but the increase will be small. voting my mail has been in use for over 15 years but did not really increase voter participation, though many more people vote by mail. hence, mail in voting had negligible effect on increasing voter participation. my point is that nonvoters have in essence have voted, they had decided to let others vote for them, since many of these nonvoters have little interest in politics and are not informed voters.	0

Such a waste of money Ian Desmond is. I thought Jeff B was NUTS to NOT offer Reynolds a contract last year, instead with the insult of a minor league deal. And then Reynolds saved the team's butt in the 1st half with his spectacular plate & field accomplishments. He was an absolute rock. And once again, the Rockies aren't bright or experienced enough to keep from throwing insane $$$ at Desmond. He was done before he started & now Rocks are stuck with this dud for another gigantic waste of a contract. Too bad they didn't save that money for Nolan, Charlie & DJ. I fear they will NEVER get it right. I'm sure that know-nothing barfly Monfort will be satisfied that the Rocks made a wildcard playoff & will sit tight for another 10 years. He needs to sell the club to another caring billionaire. I will NEVER forget Monfort's comment to the Denver populous that maybe Denver didn't deserve a major league franchise.

What I don't understand, (and I know that trump can't read), is why he so opposed to a voluntary program to cut deadly gas emissions from the air. If trumpie feels that the 28% proposed by Obama is too aggressive, then why doesn't he adjust it???? It is a VOLUNTARY pact. If he wishes to lower our contribution to it, then just do it!! To completely walk away from it is just showing off!! Climate change is far too real to be a BS rhetoric line. Has the orange Dumbo even considered the price of staying out of the agreement as opposed to at least trying to enforce some the changes proposed by the agreement. Renewable energy is the ONLY way this world can survive long term. Like it or not, our resources (coal, etc) are FINITE AND DANGEROUS!!! Coal is NOT coming back, sorry West Virginia.

True. Anyone that thinks that a boy is simply going to claim that he’s a girl to make the team hasn't thought this thru. This is school where everyone knows everyone. That means that the kid is going to have to live as a girl 24/7. Makeup. Hair. Clothing. No hanging with his male friends. No male sports. Not to mention that he’s just removed himself from the hetero dating pool, pretty much permanently. And that’s not even considering what his former male buds will call him. Gay and fag are among the kinder words. And then we get to the physical bullying - 10% of trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted.	1

Alaska has the slowest and most expensive internet in the country. The lower 48 has organic, sustainably raised local food available year round. Alaska has Carrs. The lower 48 has sunshine and warm oceans. Alaska has mostly rain now thanks to climate change, and an ocean cold enough to cause mass shrinkage.

"A fundamental problem is the attitude of law enforcement and the judicial system towards alcohol... When the assailant is drunk, alcohol is treated as an excuse for violent assault. Many domestic violence court cases are essentially dismissed with ""He's a good husband who got drunk, send him to some AA-meetings and everything will be fine"". When the victim is drunk, alcohol is an excuse for lack of consent. Look no further than Justice Gregory Lenehan's ruling on the Halifax taxi-rape case. We cannot address violence against women without addressing alcohol."	0

Donnie is probably still too stupid/racist/stubborn to do the right thing. To recap, that would be: 1. Retract the BothSiderist narrative unambiguously, wholeheartedly and without any whining about the media or any other diversion. 2. Take the blame for his whipping up racists with his rhetoric, and promise to change his ways. 3. As gesture of good faith and show he means it, fire Sessions, Gorka, Bannon and Miller. Anything less is not enough. The above would be just the start. But who am I kidding? He's a racist child and will never grow up.

When the International Criminal Court takes on Western nations for their war crimes, only then will it acquire any credibility. I can even give the ICC an example of where to start. On May 1, 2011, NATO warplanes under the command of a Canadian Brigadier-General attacked a civilian home in a residential area of Tripoli, Libya. The intent was to kill Moamar Gadhafi, the leader of Libya, who was believed to be visiting his son and grand-children at their home. The missiles struck the home and demolished it, but Gadhafi either wasn't there or escaped unharmed. Instead, the attack killed Gadhafi's son (a civilian) and his three children under the age of 12. The UN mandate under which NATO was operating only authorized NATO to use force to protect civilians in Libya. There was certainly no authorization to kill Gadhafi. Instead, NATO launched an attack on a civilian home where Gadhafi was believed to be, killing a number of civilians including children. That's a clear-cut war crime.	0

Which gets to your next point of how to handle lack of ethics and corruption. Not only should officials discovered to have broken the public trust never be allowed to hold office, they should be in jail.

Bob, thanks for the rational response. What I intend about it, is an earnestness of purpose that I do not find in the traditional posters here. It seems that regardless of their education, and the greater extent of their orthodox belief the less informed they are about science, even what science says about itself. To me that is the shame of purpose. Those who accept the knowledge afforded us by science is due solely because it is warranted by evidence. At any time the evidence or proof is found wanting and void of support, science changes, admits its mistakes, and adapts to the findings. I hope and intend to do the same. My quest is to respond accurately and currently with information. I too want to know what is in agreement with reality and hold onto what I say only as long as what I think and say is supported by facts. If not I too change...I wish religion would do so, and stop the adamant folly of faith with a refusal to know, discover and admit to error.	0

"Harper ruled for a decade and the CPC erred in the timing of their succession plan; they should've done it a few months before the election. He basically overstayed his welcome.

I'm not a member or supporter of any party, but have been here during the 1990s and saw first-hand what destruction the NDP can cause to society, communities and households. I only hope they never return again, for the welfare of us all. I would dearly love to support a truly progressive, 21st c party, capable of running a $48Billion province, but the Dippers - calling themselves 'New"" for over half a century, haven't looked up the word 'branding' - are utterly incapable of governing.

Also in the Eastern Rites, the people were often in constant motion, kissing icons, lighting candles, kissing the Gospel book as it was processed through the church, each person crossing themselves, bowing, etc as the spirit moved them. (and the men leaving to have a quick smoke outside the doors). Here in the USA most of the Eastern Catholic Churches have pews, as well as the Greek Orthodox churches. Not sure about the rest of American Orthodoxy.	0
Ah Tim, is this the latest strategy to for Republican's to be competitive in Oregon? Try and convince us with poor logic and selective data that the party of Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Carson, etc. isn't really the bumbling fools they appear to be? And how about the unfounded idealism that the pure free market is the best system, that low taxes are a panacea for all that ails, and that businesses are perfectly capable of regulating themselves without negative consequences. While liberalism, like any large group, will have it's fair share of those that misbehave, your arguments are either disingenuous, or incompetent. Take your pick.	1

"Sr. Wendy Becket had this important insight about all of this irregular business : ""I believe in loyalty. We should respect our church, but never believe that the church has the last word. The church is saying 'this', but I believe that sooner or later 'this' will change. 'This' is not the mind of our Lord. God is all love. It's a delicate balancing thing. The Church has changed its position over the years, and because the spirit is with the Church, in the end the Church will always get it right. But in the end. The spirit of the Church is the meaning of love, which hasn't yet, perhaps, been fully understood."" I wish that her willingness to rely on Love rather than rules could spread to more and more of the daughters and sons of the Church."	0

Oh good, another partially educated history scholar. Colorado has been part of the United States longer than it was a Spanish or Mexican territory. Spain claimed the territory, and didn't do much with it. Mexico gained independence from Spain, and inherited Colorado during that time. Mexico was utterly defeated in a war with the US, and they lost their inherited lands in what is now the US. If you need a refresher on any of this, pick up a book, or check out wikipedia.	0
And all we can thing of doing is going out there and blowing their brains out because they are NOT human. That is wrong, they were here first, NOT us.

We need to enact the ESA act and put all the animal species under the ESA, wolves, grizzlies, black bears, polar bears and so forth, and anyone who harms them gets punished and I mean punished with jailtime big time as the federal law allows, because that's a federal law. These animals are just living their lives, with no intent on harming anyone, unless you intent on harming them. They are reactionary, just like most animals.

WOW! The ignorance here is unbelievable! PLEASE understand our rights before advocating taking them away. 1st.....The AR15 has been on sale in the US since 1965....The issue is PEOPLE not the method of their attack...The Boston bombers used fireworks to kill, Oklahoma city bomber used fertilizer, and on 9/11 they used airplanes...There are currently THOUSANDS of laws on the oohs pertaining to guns and we don't enforce most of them.. This foolish notion that the bad guys who currently break todays laws will all of a sudden start abiding by the next set passed. Here is an idea.Lets start going after gangs and inner city thugs. They contribute the most to our gun violence issue but are never discussed. Then lets start enforcing the laws. Arrest and punish those caught with illegal guns or who break the law with guns. I spend a lot of time and money to do it legally...Most cops don't want bans on rifles as they are used in less than 4% of gun crimes, they want bad guys locked up, not out	1
There is some basic math missed by Dear Supreme Leader and his cohorts. Yes, there is a sizable trade deficit between the two nations. The inexpensive goods were mostly machinery, production equipment rather than retail goods we the general public see in the stores such as Walmart. The companies import these goods to keep their costs down. If they increase to the level of the proposed tariffs, it will severely impact the liquidity access for these enterprises. Banks have covenants in place on their debt facilities that they extend to various businesses. If the cost of production and goods zip way up, it impacts the margins on the end product and the sellability of that product. What happens next is a credit review will be called under the debt agreement. If the defaults cannot be cured within the prescribed period a negative event will be called. The bank steps in and places the business in remediation review. In other words, we will see more business failures. Jobs lost.	0

On the campaign trail, politicians say anything, literally anything, that will garner votes. Trump is no exception and neither is Hillary. Hyperbole, stretching the truth, taking out of context, and outright lying are daily occurrences. Somehow, we have gotten to the point where any candidate who does not do this will lose. That is on the voters as much as it is on the candidates. But while serving in public office, this behavior is intolerable. Hillary Clinton has made a career of it for 25 years or more. Trump may do the same, but we don't know yet. But Hillary, we are certain of her character while in office, and it is offensive. Mr. Dionne and other Hillary supporters ignore this behavior, or even excuse it. That is also offensive, because he is a member of the press. Neither Trump nor Hillary are Christians according to their fruits. But Trump is correct about at least one thing: our leaders ARE selling Christianity down the tubes. But it is not Trump doing it. It is the left.	0

Bullshit argument. You may mean well, but I have seen too many poor uneducated families who have little or no access to family planning because of political and financial barriers to helping the poor. Isn't it possible that given that Trump (and other billionaires) pay little or no taxes, taxpayers are having to pay extra to cover the costs that his family children and all avoid. So we pay for the police that protect his golf courses and resorts. and pay for the air force that flies over the skies protecting all those private schools. Meanwhile his followers are duped into attacking the weak and being lackeys to the powerful. It's called following anti-christianity and subservience to the real parasites of capitalism's excesses and corruption.	1

Taxes imposed for the purpose to impose an opinion then curb human behavior is unconstitutional where there is no rational bases that can otherwise be established concerning common law standards for health, safety, or welfare. If not so, then we wouldn't need to avail upon the power to tax. All we'd have to do is repeat prohibition without reason for health, safety, or welfare. I've never drank alcohol beverages and don't drink canned juices or pop. I'd love for them to be illegal, because I'm tired of my rising insurance premiums even though I've not visited an MD for several decades now. I believe that there is enough public safety data for government to defend a prohibition on defined alcoholic beverages, and public health data defending a prohibition on defined processed sugared drinks.

"The place is a cesspool of neglect, poverty, criminality and desperation. Its population is a volatile mix of locals, immigrants (many of whom are illegal), workers, unemployed and criminals. To top it all, it resides on a steep slope. I have no idea how the authorities think they can make this place liveable, without spending hundreds of millions on terracing and installing sewerage, water and power. It is also probably one of the most dangerous spots in the city. Blocking will require some form of census, and many if it's residents don't want that, for obvious reasons. The only way to get it right is for the community itself to identify the criminal elements that live among them, isolate them, and then participate in the ""blocking"" as temporary city employees. The city will have to break its own laws to expedite this process."	1

Well there we go with the avalanche of personal attacks, my arguments are racist idiotic etc but lets face it - I do know that Alexandria your first mention is a perfect example of how culture and knowledge spread across the planet having first been colonised by Greeks, then the Arabs and even the Turks before the British. Timbuktu - also a product of Arab colonialisation and mentioned as an ancient example before Fort Hare South Africa and Makerere Uganda under British colonialisation 1916.	1

"You could change the word ""Cuba"" in your post to ""Iran"" and it your comments would almost fit perfectly. Except the part where Liberals (Obama, France, The rest of the EU, and Canada) made sure we lifted the embargo and restored trade (as opposed to free trade). The world owes Iran a debt of gratitude - by their own words they have no problem with gay marriage as they regularly marry gays to the end of a rope, and there's no health care crisis in Iran, in fact no crisis of any sort, that anyone and certainly not a journalist, would care to discuss in the public forum lest they find themselves either married to a rope or growing mildew between their toes in a dark dank cell.

Your comments suggest that this would be a better world without ""American crap"", yet I wonder how much / little American crap you have in your comfortable western existence"	1
lol really? So trump is basically a white supremacist? Funny where were all you racial superheroes battling the evil Trumps white supremacy beforehand. He’s been in the spotlight for 20+ years but hardly a peep about his racism until he wipes the floor with Hillary.

I'v attended the Hub on a few occasions and found Atheists have an interesting characteristic similar to Theists. Theists are unable to prove there are G-worded entities and most Atheists are unable to prove there is an absence of G-worded entities. Therein Theists and Atheists only believe their particular persuasions. Therein also they may both be defined as religions in there own non-taxable rights. A minor difficulty for Atheists tho is that it is difficult to prove what avoids existing avoids existing. But most Atheists go with it is the Theists that should prove there are G-worded entities as compared to having to prove again, what avoids existing avoids existing. Therein both Theism and Atheism are based in belief systems. There are proofs of G-worded entities being pure silliness, but other than enough room in this reply for now. But the Hub is a great place to discuss such possibilities and what makes sense in the absence of G-worded entities.	0

With the longstanding throttle hold on the Ak Legislature - securely held by BigOIl - the only hope for honest government, along with preservation of the PermFund & the PFD as we've come to know it, is to break the grip of BigOil. (Oh, there's BigTourism, BigFishing, BigConstruction, BigUnions,etc. which should be dealt with in similar fashion. But with a high percentage of Legislators directly connected to BigOIl, the only way we can expect positive change is by first installing an effective new set of ETHICS RULES, such as demanding recusal from voting on issues in which the Legislator has obvious conflicts of interest. The Legislature will resist this - we constituents must insist! New Ethics Rules have the best chance of being adopted if drafted by a Citizens' Committee, then widely advertised, placed on an Initiative. All tax regimes should be simplified, secret meetings & agreements should be forbidden. This should be the first goal of Alaskans United.	0

"By now I would think that an intelligent man like Sullivan would have realized how negatively the house/senate repeal bills affect Alaska and his fellow veterans: ""Veterans. Trumpcare will hurt nearly every American in some way. But some Americans will be hit even harder. Among those the hardest hit are veterans, many of whom rely on Medicaid. A new CAP column finds that under the Senate health care bill 460,000 veterans would lose Medicaid coverage by 2026—even more than under the House plan."" New NPR/Marist poll out today shows that the senate version of trump/mcconnell care garners only 17% approval. And that poll was taken in the week before the CBO score showing 22 million Americans would lose access to health insurance was released. Virtually the same polling results as the rwyancare version passed by the house with Young's yes vote. It's a harmful bill that does nothing to address the high health insurance premiums and high deductibles plaguing American families. Sad, very sad"	0

Good questions all Bob. I don't have the figures on total cost for buildings, administrative personnel, materials like paper and copier supplies, technology support, (on and on and on) but its a lot. There should be oversight on where the funding is being spent. This is a people business though, requiring educated people (some of the lowest paid jobs that still require a 4-year degree). In my 14 years as a public school teacher, I've been asked to do more and more, with less and less every year. I spend about an hour per day (unpaid) during the week planning lessons, returning emails, grading papers (on and on and on) and another hour on Sundays (again unpaid) prepping for Monday. I've never worked for a district (I've worked for 3) that funded everything I needed to run my classes without my personal investment. Your wrong on the 4th grade ratio comment.

It should be noted that the vast majority of opposition to this pipeline comes those who will have the terminus in their back yard and tankers on their waterfront, and they have ever right to oppose.

Useless and repetitive arguments do not help move the conversation forward but they will stiffen resistance to the project. 1. Suggestions that it's better to produce oil from the worlds most environmentally expensive source instead of regions where human rights are not respected perplex me. If we are willing to sell Saudi Arabia guns why would we have a problem buying their oil? 2. Pointing out that environmentalists drive cars, fly and use plastic is silly because it doesn't address the fundamental problem of the oil sands which is how difficult and environmentally expensive it is to get a single barrel of oil out of the dirt there.	0

"""A little salty."" Try a little stinky as in putrid. These players make obscene salaries. Since they are so well paid, they should be well prepared. However, Denver seems to believe its season will go as the first two games went: One, a close call win over the Los Angeles Chargers and two, a beatdown in D-town of a fake-crown Dallas team. So, now we hear a bunch of baloney about what Denver needs to do. So what? It's not what you say that counts. It's what you do. In my opinion, the Broncos once again come out flat. No running game. No passing game. Sloppy tackling. Surrendered first downs. Excessive penalties. A team living on borrowed time and heading toward another year of mediocrity."	1

Well, Your Js have been 'bout a .500 team, even with the injuries, since their god-awful 1-8, 2-11 start. If they'd started 6-7, 5-8 or something like that, they'd be around a .500 team right now, sorta in the hunt instead of last place in the AL. So let's not dump all of this on injuries, OK? Problem for management is that they only have 'bout 55 or so games to sort this out. The Pillar suspension tells you how sensitive management is to the fan base, doing things for PR effect rather than what's best for the team. So, nobody should have any confidence that the guys running the show are going to make the right call when the trading deadline gets here.

A pre-Vat II notion of mercy, which, really, isn't mercy at all, but gracious condascension. This served a monarchical/hierarchical eccleisiology, which is pretty much what the Church, pre-Vat II, was all about. God is merciful, not because he chooses to be, but because he is compassionate. Compassion is drawn by weakness. Human weakness especially. Did the pre-Vat II institutional Church know God at all? (And to think some want the ecclesial wheel to turn full circle.😲)	0

"To the journalists who had a combined effort in this article (7 of you) -- thank you. You wrote an interesting and thoughtful piece that attempted to illustrate the difficulties in the DTES on cheque day. I've lived close by to the neighborhood (over 15 years) and am aware of how the nightly count of ambulance sirens increases on the 4th Wednesday, every month. Sadly, after one week, less than 100 people commented. This is my 3rd post and I've noticed other multiple posters. Maybe you received 70 people who actively committed to the story. Of those, no one offers solutions (except me, I'm biased though). Write something that's out there. Are there solutions? Is Vancouver the only place where all of these programs exist? Is there not drug addiction of this size in Toronto? Has it gotten worse since the VPD station moved out. My dad (passed away) used to be a beat officer along the Main and Hastings strip. It was a ""character"" neighborhood then. Should we expect it to be different now?"	0

"The 1000 Rich Guys From Portland, and their LCDC invention, have forced cities to pack the sardine cans more densely. It's the law. There are few, if any, single family homes being built in many Oregon cities because those cities have to meet density parameters to free up land to use for McMansions. And McMansions is what you get because the land is too expensive to build ""affordable"" homes on. $100,000 lots, $30,000 building permits, $50,000 buried utilities and streets, sidewalks, and you soon have $200,000 in a one square foot birdhouse. A modest construction and house plan, keeping the building costs to under $150 per square foot, for a 2000 sq ft house with a double garage that actually can park two cars, the requisite landscaping, and you are at $500,000. A 60 year old home of the same square feet, updated, maybe paved parking under a carport roof, mature landscaping, nice neighborhood, better schools, and you can get by for $300,000 and up. Affordable?"	0

and my advice to this clown with a pen is to get therapy for his over inflated ego that is blinded by the fact his idea of progressive is as vulgar as it's political twin, pseudo-conservatism. Robinson deludes himself when he claims the GOP is only divided, by 3, when in truth the GOP hasn't been able to get a damn thing accomplished because they are so deeply divided...just as the democrats are deeply divided between Sanders-Warren folks, and Pelosi-Clinton folks. Neither party has learned a damn thing. Therein is the real opportunity...for a third party candidate to rise, and take the moderates from both parties leaving them nothing but the extreme.	1
"There is a world of difference between doing what your constituents tell you to do and doing what party power players like the president or the leader in the senate tell you to do. If you are accusing John McCain of doing what the people who put him in office told him to do, then I think he would be found guilty much of the time. If you are accusing McCain of caving to pressure from power players within the party, I think you would actually find that he is the most independent of the GOP senators. President Bush capsulized this well in the funniest address he gave to the annual white house press gallery dinner (the 2007). W. said that it was now time for Americans to come together, ""Republicans, Democrats and John McCain"". Look, I get it Alceste. You despise Trump even more than you did Harper. You lean left, probably NDP. So you reflexively ""react""as disliking all my posts. You even in this case carry water for the despicable Mark Shore. But please read up on John McCain."	0
Well said. What is really wrong-headed about this approach is that it leads to lower hiring standards for these groups. Those hired will then not do as well on average. This will then perpetuate the myth that these groups are not as good at science which will discourage future generations of these groups from going into these areas and so perpetuate the problem. Apart from that the fact that the government is actively supporting sexism and racism will hugely undermine the message we teach kids at school that these forms of discrimination are completely unacceptable. You only have to look to the US to see where that can lead: two wrongs don't make a right, in this case they lead to the far right.	0

Welcome to social justice! You, as a person, don't matter. Your history doesn't matter, your experience doesn't matter, and your skills, intelligence and creativity don't matter. What matters is your combination of tags, the things you were born with that someone can tick off on a master list of egregious sins and desired virtues. After 50 years of trying to make our society sex blind, gender blind, sexuality blind and race blind, and making slow but sure inroads on all those fronts, now our society has veered abruptly left and we're paying more attention to those factors than ever before, because quotas loom, diversity targets loom, ranking systems loom, and we're facing a world where positive and negative discrimination are acceptable ... if you aim at the right combination of tags. The right tags means employment, romantic success, and social validation. The wrong tags? Well, you were born a filthy sinner, weren't you? It's just a 2017 version of original sin, all over again	1
""" saying it is part of his mandate to “create middle-class jobs, economic growth and long-term prosperity for Canadians.” More evidence that Trudeau and his government are economic morons.

There is no parallel to the scourge of Hamas, ISIS, and other Islamist cancers - they are groups of rabid inhuman cowards. Searching for false parallels only demonstrates a shocking anti-Israel bias and the perception of sympathy for pigheaded Islamists. Look at what happened to Gaza when Israel withdrew, it was turned into a terrorist staging ground by the scum that make up Hamas and other Islamist parasite groups. Palestinian children are taught that Israel does not exist, they are taught perpetual war based on 7th century gibberish. The biggest impediment to peace for the Palestinians stares their leaders in the face every time they look in a mirror.	1

Well this is a juvenile comment. And I don't mean that as any sort of pun, I mean it as in: your comparison of Trump and Trudeau is juvenile and uninformed. It sounds like you've digested a lot of hyper-partisan junk regarding Trudeau, and you're just repeating it ad naseum. To be honest I have not been overly impressed by our PM, but he's clearly an adult both intellectually and emotionally. Trump is physically an adult, but emotionally he's a child, and during the debates he sounded like a 10 year old giving a poorly done book report. None of that is hyperbole.	0

The New Dinosaurs are correct; if they post their donations, it won't do anything to clean up their politics. This is just another example of what rank amateurs are the Dinosaurs. One small matter, one small gesture, and they blew it.

How can they run a $46billion province when they can't even manage themselves. I mean no insult to amateurs, the NDP are just bizarre. And who do they got to speak? Some mom from Coquitlam who squeaked in a first term in a 'safe' riding (meaning they repeatedly vote for the losing side. That's why the Downtown Eastside is the NDP's 'flagship').

Trump was not drafted during the Vietnam War, and he did not enlist either as a volunteer or as a Reserve Officer Training Corps candidate.[22] While Trump was in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments.[23] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board. In October of that year, he was given a 1-Y medical deferment,[24] which was attributed to heel spurs.[25] In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which gave him a low probabilty to be called to military service.	0

"You're entitled to be indifferent about Trump, but I suggest that it is nothing to be smug about. I don't hate Trump - your use of that word is reckless - but I detest what he has done and is doing to the country and to the world, by what he says and does, and also (as in the Charlottesville incident) in what he fails to say and do. I respect the constitutional processes that are available to deal with Trump, but the process requires an aroused citizenry to work. Only two presidents have been impeached and none has been removed by the constitutional process. As for resistance: I think it's a moral imperative in response to the racist and anti-life policies of this president. I regard your ""live and let live"" response to white supremacist, neo-Zazi and KKK ideology as morally repugnant. In a previous post, which I can no longer find, you wrote: <I am among those who pray for his well being that through him God might manifest his power, might, and justice.> What would that look like?"	1

The 15% tax on foreign buyers should also be directed to local citizens at about 10% if sold within 5 years the term length of the mortgage, reason being many of whom are notorious for their adventurous investment in pre-condo sales. Slap them with a tax if the residential property is sold within 5 of years this will only help legitimate buyers and not speculators. Of course there should be just cause for selling if proof is shown job assignment to a different place, maybe a portion tax on the increased value of the property instead of 10% Especially the Chinese who are good at this game Hong Kong and the mainland flourished in property sales from working class people. This unbeatable concept of investment landed here only points to people who has money and leave Toronto young couple with mouth gaping.	0
Already people in Canada have no idea what they are allowed to say without falling afoul of some stupid government regulator, federal or provincial, and all this has happened since Pierre Trudeau made multiculturalism a key plank in his plan to destroy English Canada. There is no question that this has not only changed the face of the country, particularly in the cities, but has led to white flight, undocumented by the MSM. As for the motion before the house, this is a further infringement on freedom of speech in Canada, amidst serious concern south of the border about immigration from certain countries, in contrast to the serious concern north of the border to ensure re-election of the Liberal government through immigration from those same countries, where the female role is to have babies, hide their faces, and submit to male domination. Lack of freedom of speech has become a Canadian value, if this motion passes how can it be otherwise?	1

"The conclusion that ""swing"" states would lose importance is not consistent with the objective of the National Popular Vote concept. The swing states are important because they have a high population now and would continue to have high population with a purely popular vote election. In fact, given the current slight advantage the electoral college gives to low population states, which would be lost under the purely popular vote method, swing states would become relatively more important. I find the drive to tinker with the system that has served us well for over 200 years based on discontent over Trump to be unfortunate. Naturally, the democrats support this move because the small population western states tend to vote Republican and they have a slightly higher weight in the electoral college."	0

Wow! An extremely well-balanced letter section here, ADN! I'm not voting for Trump, the jerk who is the only candidate the crook could actually win against. I'm also not voting for Clinton the criminal. Clowns on the right, criminals on the left ... what's a thinking voter to do? I'm voting 3rd Party. The only thing keeping Gary Johnson from winning and maybe bringing ethical and sane leadership to the White House is people who refuse to vote for the clown and the criminal to vote for him instead. That's 60% of the electorate, according to polls. So, stop buying the propaganda that says you have to vote for one of the main party candidates or you're wasting your vote. That's stupid! Voting for either one of these two odious idiots is wasting your vote. Vote for some real change and let's see what we get.

Great article by Mr. Heinzl. These things are definitely not for the average investor.

It's dumb to consider it in the first place. I am sure this dumb idea comes from the military too. They have romantic dreams of past glory. Trudeau, to be smart, should spell out in public his policy: - Canada does NOT do peacekeeping anymore. It's a fool's game. - Canada formally exit American War on Terror and pull all engagements out - Canada exit NATO. We becomes non-aligned. We can establish a reasonable security arrangement with the EU based on our CETA trade agreement. Not based on American Cold War fabrication.	0
My fear is that what you suggest happens, but things will not start to unravel on him. Instead they will get worse and Trump will do little or nothing to stop it.

There is just too much in this comment that deserves to be challenged ... not least, the blindness to the fact that the US Catholic Church is now divided. You may not like the labels some people use to describe the factions.

"I had to think some about your statement: ""doing something or not doing something just because it pleases ‘other countries’ will never persuade me by itself."" I agree. But here is a contradiction I think I notice in statements, mostly by the Right. 1. America is a shining example to the world of how great democracy is. 2. We should not look weak to other countries. Not just militarily, but also in image. When Obama bows to a leader, he is embarrassing our country. 3. The Iran deal was an embarrassment to our country's image. But if someone argues that some other action by our country is going to generate a negative image, my impression is that the Right comes out saying what other countries think does not matter. I'm am just thinking this through so it may not be that important."	0

Hello, Sr. Pacatte. I think Moira, who IIRC is a lesbian in the book, remains a lesbian in the Hulu series. However, in the book she's assumed to be white, whereas in the series she's black. I have been watching the show, and I thought in one of the flashback scenes June (Offred) teases Moira about taking off with a woman whose name she can't recall. However, I might have projected what I'd read in the book onto the scene. Thank you for sharing the story of your poor sister in intestinal distress. It's great when women (and men, for that matter) express solidarity. Too bad we can't count on it.	0

Trump has destroyed our reputation! There may be no way to ever get it back unleash they remove him , pence, Ryan, and put John Kelly at the helm.

And you can really tell God is showing His promises now. America wake up! We were sternly warned by Trumps election. Maybe we can extend our time with him out, but God put him there to start the process of destroying us, and it's already worked and GOP don't give a hoot! They will soon see, but it will be too late! I believe uts too late already if you see escalation in Russia sanctions and their aggression! Nobody can prove me wrong.	0

Of the 16 drug companies I looked at only one (Gilead at 9%)spend less than 10% of revenue on R&D. Roche 20%, Novartis 18%, Pfizer 16%, Merck 17%, GSK 15%, Ely Lilly 25%, BMS 37%, Celegene 40%...... While drug companies may not spend that amount on a per country basis, they do on a global company wide basis. Where R&D is spent is largely a consequence of individual country income tax regulation. If Mr. Picard has a problem with these drug companies spending less on R&D in Canada and higher drug costs. He should focus his ire on the Federal government and not the drug companies. Other countries provide greater tax incentives which keep drug costs down in those countries. I prefer Canada's method where the individual using the drug incurs more of the cost, rather then all taxpayers subsidizing the drug companies with greater tax subsidizes to gain lower pricing for those few using the drugs.	0

Regarding Trump's tax returns, the latest headline is that Kellyanne Conway is now ""walking back"" her declaration that he would not release his taxes. Can they be feeling the heat? Do they care about feeling the heat? Or does Conway's about-face have more to do with Julian Assange's weekend call for anyone with access to Trump's tax forms to leak them to Wikileaks?

I think the thing the Tories went after was more he won Liberal leadership solely on his surname and if he had a different surname he never would have won the leadership let alone PM. That is probably true, but in general in life most of us get our jobs due to our connections. Also he did pick up Papineau in 2008 which was not an easy riding when the BQ was strong and held it during the 2011 meltdown so that in itself probably worked in his favour. If he lost his riding in 2008 or 2011 he would be politically finished and those were tough election years for the Liberals even in normally safe ridings let alone swing ones.	0

I agree that closing rural transfer sites would surely lead to more trash being dumped illegally. In addition to that there would be more trash burned [also illegal], along with a lot more just left around or buried on site. All of that is very difficult to police and prosecute but affects the quality of life for rural and city residents. The longer distance hauling on higher speed roads by whatever means people have will inevitably leave more unintentional spills along the roads. Eventually it all has to be dealt with and there will be both monetary and environmental costs. Personally I would happily pay more than I currently do for the use of the relatively nearby transfer station at Rattlesnake Road rather than hauling a trailer load of trash and recycling to Glenwood. Rate increases are never popular, and probably can't make the transfer sites balance on the books, but if the indirect costs are factored in I think they are well worth keeping in some form.	0

"The reaction of French Speaking Quebec Catholics to the flood of Irish Refugees that exploded in 1847 was very different from the reaction of the Anglo Protestants. Quarantine facilities were overwhelmed with dead and dying Irish Depopulation refugees. French Catholic Grey Nuns, Sister of Providence and even the Cloistered Sisters of Hôtel-Dieu volunteered to care for the sick and dying, knowing that they would probably sicken and die themselves. Priests in Quebec delivered their sermons holding Irish orphans in their arms to encourage parishioners to adopted the kids. http://www.aoh.com/reasons-for-learning-an-gorta-mor-the-great-hunger/ http://lekiosquemedias.com/2013/01/17/petite-histoire-des-irlandais/ ""May 14, 1847, the St. Lawrence is still covered in three centimeters of ice when the first ship docked at Grosse Île to undergo quarantine there.

"Oh Ruben you are so entertaining. Whenever I post a link you click on it and study it. Good for you dear but your thinking is clouded by prejudice for Trump. Read the Fox story again dear Trump has used foreigners for years and years. . You actually think there is no one in Virginia who can lift 80 pounds or walk in a field in the daytime? Instead of applying for foreigners Trump should hire Americans. It's all about Trump being cheap and wanting to control his workers. If they complain he gets to say ""you're fired"" and send them home. Read the rules about the H-2B visa, people with those visas have no rights and can't quit to work anywhere else.

We have more than 40 years of studies stating, time and time and time again, that domestic violence, between men and women are: perpetuated at roughly equal rates and are largely mutual (both partners are violent to each other). These findings have been replicated in study after study, all around the world. The Canadian Government's own Ministry of Health statistics and research show this! This is not just a difference of opinion or perspective, its deliberate and willful ignorance of the evidence and facts by the Trudeau Government. Addressing only half of the problem is not going to solve anything. When wives beat their husbands (and inevitably their children),their children then beat on other women (and men). Since no one cares a whit for men, I'll phrase this in terms people will get: not addressing women's' abuse of men means more women and (female) children will be abused in the future.	1

Something wonderful then happened......I received a letter in the mail telling me that I was being dropped from coverage. I imagine it was because I was about to hit my deductible. I about have that bill paid off 8 years later. My point? I was responsible, and did things to insure that I wasn't a burden on society. My wife and I didn't spend money frivolously during that period...and that's when things started breaking down. We had a kid under the age of 9 at that time. Nearest family is 4 hours away. Both of us working 2 jobs wasn't an option, and neither was her putting me on her insurance. Her take-home pay literally would been about 15% of what it was with just her. I'm not saying the ACA is perfect, but there are some things that need to be kept. You can figure that out I'm sure based on the above story. My point is that the old way might be fine.....until that day comes when it isn't.	0
"I liked this column very much. Wab Kinew makes a lot of very good sense and sensibility. For the most part I agree with him. But does anyone see the hypocrisy and the scapegoatism in his conclusion:  ""There is room in our circle for everyone, even those who do not behave as we would like. We include them not just to make our circle bigger. We love one another as relatives because it frees our hearts from hurt and allows us to embrace the goodness in each of us. When we do that, we are stronger.""  This begrudging acceptance of someone who did no harm to anyone, giving him an inferior status - it reminds me of how indigenous North Americans treated captives. They made him run a cruel gauntlet of pain, humiliation and suffering. If he died he died. If he survived he became a subordinate member of the tribe."	0

"In their first game of the season, the Ducks had 12 penalties. In their second game of the season, the Ducks had 12 penalties. You might notice from this the Ducks did not learn about avoiding penalties. What do you suppose will happen when they face an even better opponent than Nebraska if the Ducks do not learn that lesson, Cap'n Obvious? Regarding extra points, I will give Taggart some--but very little--credit for not repeating the error of last year's coach who decided to try the stupidest football tactic ever of going for 2 after each touchdown, apparently adhering to ""If at first you don't succeed..."" Doing it once during a game when the opponent is not prepared for or expecting it may gain you an advantage. Doing it every time when your opponent has proven they are prepared for it gets you fired. So will 12 penalties every game if you don't correct it, since you won't win many PAC-12 games that way. But I'm sure Taggart knows this and will take care of it, as it is easily done."	0
"Yes, I focused on the difference between the Commission and the Tribunal - a difference you clearly didn't understand when you wrote your comment. I'm happy if you now do. Perhaps it has woken a desire to find out more true facts about how Human Rights adjudication operates in Ontario. The Commission may blow its own horn about its ""unique legal powers"", but they no longer include any powers to adjudicate, quasi-judicially or otherwise. It doesn't conduct hearings. Period. The concept of bias is entirely different when talking about prosecution instead of adjudication. And by the way, when was the last time the OHRC ""launched a prosecution before Courts and Tribunals""? I'm aware of none since the 2008 major revision of the Code. Proceedings at the Tribunal are civil disputes between two parties, not prosecutions by the state. Losing parties are not 'convicted' they simply lose. They are not fined, they have damages ordered against them."	0

My wife grew up hunting and around guns, but had never used a handgun and had never thought of using a gun in self defense until we had break-ins in our neighborhood and had photo's from a game camera of people checking out our home.

While most will vilify the NRA, they are mainly an education organization and offer plenty of classes on using a gun safely. I would suggest anyone interested try one of the courses.	0

So to must US national security forces and administration attribute and view the acts of individual members of White Supremacists organizations. White Supremacists have, for the 8 years prior to Trump, been an open and direct threat to not only American civility, but indeed the sitting American President. That threat is, perhaps, something that is at the forefront of Trump's mind.

There have been several editorials. It really is too bad that you have no way of defending China's disgusting conduct with respect to its so-called justice system; but at least you seem to realize there is no defence. It's a start."	0

I wonder how many Canadians know how Canada is really managed? Imagine Jiustin a man who has used drugs as has his Mom? Where will they get their fresh blood supply if they are in an accident?And the RCMP control us but who else. Justin a man who joked about the Shawinigan handshake? Assault and battery causing harm is no joke at all! Jean Chretien a man who was reported to have not only threatened in the past but made a joke about pepper spray and what else? Pierre Trudeau a man who was a fascist and nazi supporter during WW 2, not risking his life was he like so many other young man and women who were real Canadians? It is no wonder that Pierre made the RCMP report more directly to him? And we could cross the fence and ask Brian Mulroney about so many things? Snowden exposed the rot in the system and only part of it! Remember when a loyal Tory Glen Kealey outside the House of Commons to complain about reports on Mulroney's government corruption... he was arrested.	0

Trump does stupid things like the tweet on Mika that deserves criticism but the media needs to treat conspiracy theories equally. The Russian collusion story rings the shadow of McCarthyism. The evidence that Russia was the one that hacked the DNC is even weak and that is the whole basis of it.

The 2003 invasion of Iraq involved unprecedented U.S. media coverage, especially CNN.

Remember Peter Arnett who then questioned media propaganda. And today we have Tim Allen.	0

You are so wrong on every point. The church hasn't been a part of the dome for years. They ENABLED the dome to be built by acting as guarantor on bond payments. There are NO common board members of the dome and the elder board at the church. The truth is that the church guaranteed bond payments to the tune of over $300k out of general tithes when the dome wasn't able to fully make the payments. Lastly, the church has never received ANY rent on the dome or the property. The church donated the land when the dome restructured their debt some years ago.

KK - we have the biggest sexual assault & domestic violence rates in all 50 states - this does not hobble parenting not does it make girls more likely to be sexually abused. Rapists, pedophiles and child abusers DO NOT take their victims to get abortions!! They leave their victims beaten up, bleeding, ashamed, sick, threatened, scared, embarrassed, alone and traumatized. Now you want to add to that trauma by forcing them to have to tell their parents??!! Good God, you are uniformed and completely clueless about abuse and victims. NONE of my abusers EVER took me to Planned Parenthood, ER room, Doctor or a Hospital. I was left alone, ashamed, traumatized and as every female victim left to pick up the pieces and make the best dcicions for surviving trauma for me. You want to know what your kids are up too?

"Higher education was gutted? Thirty years ago, before Measure 5, Peter Courtney, who'd given up his state representative seat to run for Congress, was hired by the president of then-Western Oregon State College to lobby, among other things. In typical Courtney fashion, he declared WOSC in such dire financial straits as to be ""on the embalming table"" without more state support. Measure 5 took full effect a decade later. Look at WOU now. Enrollment up 24 percent the past decade, 81 percent in-state students. Never healthier. And a new rec center, named for guess who? Meanwhile, back at the ""flagship,"" the captain just happened to be the former state attorney general (R), who cast his lot with Big Sneaker and pushed hard for autonomy. They got it. Welcome to the quasi-private UO, chardonnay on tap, if your bank account has the requisite zeroes. Enrollment trend: 2005-06 -- 70/30 in-state; 2015-16 -- 51/49 in-state. Oops. The UO made its bed.

"""Thomas Jefferson, who never heard a broadcast, was undoubtedly right when he observed that “to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagations of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.” Quoting Thomas Jefferson for this article is a hilarious but also sad bit of cruel irony. Jefferson widely used the press of the day to plant false stories and fake accusations against John Adams to discredit Adams at every turn. Jefferson was a conniving liar and knew how to use the press to further his own career.

True but wouldn't that would mean the first holder was part of the negotiation that permitted his/her rights to become secondary?

HST or income tax) then if the first lender foreclosed he would be required to pay the deemed trust bill.

Confront the authority of a Union at the General Conference, and gives autonomy to violate even the votes of global conferences because he has a contrary concept. 4. Confuse gender equality and difference of functions, according to current liberal concepts of liberation of women, destroying the family unit. 5. Recognizes that a Union may become a mission and that can be handled by the General Conference. 6. Find the ordination as an old woman, confused ordination as a minister, is right there would have to at the World Congress the arrangement is made so that women no longer function as a church elder, having the same concept minister this so that people do not believe that women should also and may be pastor.

"""An armed society is a sick, dangerous, often accidentally shot society"" _____ Me. Law enforcement officers are extensively trained to respond to shooter incidents and even they often can't tell who the bad guy is. (hint; they don't all wear black hats). One of the guys who helped stop Laughner after shooting all those people in Arizona was almost shot by responding police because he was holding the shooter's gun. Having a bunch of random idiots, seething in a stew of hormones, Rambo movie scenes dancing in their heads, running around with lethal weapons does nothing to promote safety and, in fact, accomplishes exactly the opposite. Concealed-carry laws statistically lead to increased rates of aggravated assault cases, general crime rate and accidental deaths by firearms. Why is it, that on military bases, where people are most certainly trained to safely and effectively use firearms and other weapons, do you NOT see people packing heat? Because they know what they're doing."	1

This is probably the best (I mean worst) example of why globalization is not working... A free flow of foreign capital into the most non-value adding and high risk laden spot in the economy making the real inflation rate to most Canadians unbearable through the largest component of the cost of living increasing in double digits with no real sustainable wealth being created. The real crime is all levels of government doing nothing... you don't need a computer or more stats to see what is happening... this is a federal issue.... on this basis, the last fed budget is a bad joke.... And if the provinces act one by one it’s still a problem somewhere else. We should all perform a tax revolt until it gets fixed.

Part 2. I hate this limitation on the number of letters allowed. I have known and encountered many women during my long life. I remember a Mother Superior of a local Convent where I served Mass. she was French, a lovely, stout woman who allowed us to play tennis on the Convent’s court. She was an imposing woman and in any altercation with the local clergy I would have bet on her to come out on top. All through my life I have encountered strong women, my mother, teachers, nuns, bosses and my wife of 45 years. True, I have come across many women with low self esteem but then many men also, it is not confined to one sex. As a married man I have always, despite posts to the contrary, regarded my wife as my equal. ironically my grown up children, all boys (now men with families of their own) want to speak to mum when they phone. Do I mind, not a bit. If I can live in harmony with a strong woman for 45 years then I conclude that feminism is a social construct. Does it say something for me?	0

"You actually believe this? ""Carefully selected ""facts"" do not prove your case."" Actually, facts do matter, Don. You are right that ""illegal immigrants voting"" and ""unqualified registrants employing flaky documentation allowed to vote"" are examples of Voter Fraud, but only if they do it on their own with no assistance (AKA, conspiracy). And, as noted, only four of these cases were documented in the 2016 regardless of what you think with no facts for support. Again: Facts matter, Don. I agree with you when you say, ""To suggest, of 135 million votes case (or counted), only 4 were fraudulent is, on its face both naive and foolish."" However, no one ever suggested that. You kind of twisted that around a little. What was found was that ""just four documented cases of VOTER fraud"" were found. No one would say that there were only four cases of overall fraudulent voting . Voter suppression diminishes the value of legal voter's right to vote much more than making it easier to vote."	0

I guess that level of cunning is why Trump was never much use to the FBI in the 80s and 90s. Trump: OK, so we've got a deal. You're going to illegally offer me money to underwrite my casinos and I'm going to PRETEND to agree. Mafioso: Uh, what? Trump: Speak a little louder, Tony.	0

"""If judicial decisions are not given their proper respect, the rule of law will break down."" All of you whiny writers keep repeating this same, whiny accusation and it sounds just as stupid in the article as it does in every OTHER article in which it appears. Here's a newsflash for you (in case you don't understand how this works): THAT'S WHAT A PARDON IS! It is the EXECUTIVE Branch exercising THEIR oversight over what has become a vindictive, activist, COMPLETELY out-of-control Judicial Branch. If you LIVE in a place where there are tons of illegal aliens, you are PROBABLY going to be put in a position where you are going to question someone's immigration status BECAUSE they are Latino. That isn't ""profiling"". That's just plain, old common sense. Like it or not, being in this nation ILLEGALLY is a CRIME and is no different than if you are ""suspected"" of driving under the influence and are pulled over for that. Thankfully, this witch hunt is now over (and good for Arpaio)."	1
I remember when Elie Wiesel spoke at the EMU in 1996. The one thing he repeated throughout it was how little the Allies did even after they knew about the mass murder taking place in the camps. Even after the U.S. knew about the death camps immigration restrictions were not changed to allow more Jews to come to the United States. It's simply disgusting that on this same day Trump, a solemn day when the US should be assessing its policy towards people who are being oppressed and murdered, has disallowed refugees from war-torn places like Syria from finding refuge in the United States. It's disgusting but not surprising as Trump has already displayed many of the psychological tendencies of a tyrant and a criminal.	1

"This is a pseudo government created disaster. I remember the nonsense 10-15 years ago with the ""pain is the 5th vital sign."" At that time hospitals who were under the Joint Commission microscope were tweaked if they were not dumping pain medications on everybody. It spread to everything because those policies affected the ER. And guess what another game is patient satisfaction scores and those are higher in institutions that prescribe more narcotics. When the measures used to judge push the use of narcotics guess what happens. Many of us resisted the ridiculous use of narcotics. There are some specialties that bought into it for financial reasons and a lot of the regulation was driven by those specialties and somewhat by big pharma but it was the policy that lit the fire. And that fire has spread elsewhere as the public latched on to it. Now people think they should never have any pain. Kind of goes well with the Bernie Sanders free stuff and all the trophies for last place."	0

"Pochoiwannabeawhiteguy: What a hypocrite. You stupid KKK lapdogs don't even realize that this ""historical"" reasoning is a red herring to dupe idiots like you. So, let me explore the logic of your ""historical"" justification and plant a thought in your tiny brain: How about statues that commemorate all of history. In Hawaii we could have statues of the sugar barons next to Queen Liluokalani so that the current beneficiaries of the Hawaiian land grab can feel good about the overthrow of the monarchy. Or maybe there should be statues of General Sherman From Mississippi to the coast of Georgia to remember, for historical purposes of course, the path of destruction and death that he carved through the Confederacy in order to bring the war to an end (talk about shock and awe, fire and fury). I'm sure the KKK, you and Trump would be just fine with that (NOT). One thing you got right though, we do despise Trump."	1

No: A faithful Catholic follows the teaching of the church about the formation of conscience; gives the teaching of the church 'pride of place' in the formation of his/her conscience and the benefit of doubt; and follows the dictates of her/his conscience. Like most Catholics, I think the teaching of the church is wrong on several matters -- among them human sexuality (birth control, masturbation and homosexuality) and the ordination of women. I am a faithful Catholic, a daily communicant most of my life -- and your opinion about this is utterly meaningless. You don't get a vote. The official church has trapped itself, to some extent, by making the preposterous claim that it can't change its teachings. The claim is ludicrous: indefensible historically and theologically.	1

(Part two of two) “The whole world spoke the same language, using the same words . . . Let us then go down and there confuse their language, so that one will not understand what another says” (Genesis 11:1 and 7). The whole world changed from letting yes mean yes and no mean no to yes and no have no meaning. “Blessed the people he Lord has chosen to be his own” (Psalm 33:12), where yes means yes and no means no. Burke is currently on the island of Guam, where he is presiding over a church trial investigating allegations of sexual abuse against the island's former archbishop.—Joshua J. McElwee.

"The motives of this group were always suspect to me. The entire issue was presented as if no reasonable person could disagree. Basic premise appeared to always be the current level of government spending is correct. I could not believe some of their PR. ""If you don't give up half of your dividend now you will not have any dividend in the future."" This does not compute. If half of the dividend now will save the government why wouldn't giving it up in the future after the reserves are spent accomplish the same thing? Never an answer to this issue. Because there is not an answer that is believable. Without a specific tie between taxes and spending there is no assurance the services are a priority. There was not information to compare Alaska government spending per capita to other similar states. Still this information is not presented."	0

Not that extreme a concept actually. If I remember my Anchorage history correctly, there was a time when the bases looked at moving across to what is now the McKenzie area near the old Site Point missile base. It had plenty of land, and avoided issues with MOA that were going on at the time. The main problem is that any naval base in this area is going to suffer the flaws of Knik Arm, which is that it needs nearly constant dredging. Nevermind the icing issues that occur. The real options for a naval base on further south: Kodiak (where USCG already is) or maybe the Aleutians. Unless we're buying some icebreakers and posting them in Alaska, which so far the Navy and Congress hasn't managed.	0

I sympathize. You will learn after a while how to play the SJW game. For all the nonsense spewed about the G&M being right of centre, the reality is that unless you rate any comment that has a whiff of anti-PC flavour as 'uncivil' your own comments will never see the light of day. There are a few 'Guardians of the Temple' who monitor the halls and delete comments that offend their fragile sensibilities. As for me, I have cancelled my subscription in disgust at the fact that garbage writers such as this columnist are paid to contribute so have no idea why I am still allowed to comment at all. For the record, I don't bother reading this columnist's drivel. I enjoy reading the comments. And sometimes trying to get my comments past the Incest Censors. But it is ultimately a tiresome and time-consuming game and one wearies of playing it and reading the same unimaginative and whining Lefty commentators over and over. But that is insufficient reason to pay for a subscription. Surrender Gaz!	1

No, a president has very little to do with abolishing constitutional rights, even if she wanted to. The original Second Amendment guaranteed the right of well-regulated state militias -- essentially, all free men -- to train and be prepared to defend freedom against a potential overweening federal government. But after the Civil War -- given that southern states had used those militias instead to oppress people (blacks) and suppress freedoms (whereas the federal government had freed people) -- the Second Amendment was reinterpreted (by the Fourteenth Amendment and other Reconstruction acts) to include the right of individuals to protect themselves, so that (for instance) freed blacks could defend themselves against the rising Ku Klux Klan. And that's where we stand today. Regulations are constitutional, and the right to defend oneself is constitutional. For more on this -- and on what it would take to change it -- read the wonderful constitutional scholar Akhil Reed Amar.	0

"Randy Lee Harkins GREAT POST.

As unpopular as the opinion was to start a war with the existing authority back then we would not have a country for me to be posting on this website had those individuals chose to back down..

I love how people, such as Mr. Caplan, who would *NEVER*, in a million years, vote Conservative regardless of who their leader is feel that the Conservatives need a different kind of leader that would appeal to them more. The fact of the matter is that Harper is the second longest-serving Conservative Prime Minister in Canadian history, only Sir. John A. Macdonald had a longer tenure in office than Harper when it comes to Conservative PMs. Winning 3 elections (1 majority and 2 minority) puts him tied with Diefenbaker for second most, again behind only Macdonald. I know a lot of Liberal and NDP supporters think the Conservatives should have a leader more like Robert Stanfield or maybe Jean Charest, but the reality is that those two lost every election they contested.	0

Prior to Obamacare, the insurance industry could keep costs down by not insuring risky customers, now they had to which meant increasing premiums to cover anticipated increased costs.

Both my grandfathers and my father fought for Canada against the Germans in the two world wars. I often wonder how hard it was for them to return and live a normal life.

Police away, MSW, it won't make any difference. All the people who voted for Donald Trump were willfully oblivious to his lies during the campaign. None of that will change once he takes the oath of office. He can continue to lie about everything with complete impunity, from his ties to Russia to his business conflicts of interest, and nobody will care. He won, and to Republicans, that's the only thing that matters. The means (allowing lies to stand unchallenged) justified the end, and the next end is for Republicans to maintain power by any means necessary so they can dismantle Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and reduce taxes on corporations and the 1% to nothing. And they will succeed, despite MSW's ardent policing efforts because half the country, those who will most likely be hurt by such policies, won't even notice because they'll be too busy being brainwashed by Fox News' attempts to blame everything on some Democrat, probably Bernie Sanders, or maybe Obama.

"Bannon was part of the far right that wanted a single payer, Canadidan style, health insurance program (""to make America Great again, you need to take care of Americans""). A little odd, but that is the way the far right is as they overlap with Bernie Sanders. Generals McMasters and Mattis are NOT anti-Muslim (McMaster did not want to use the term ""radical Islam""), they believe climate change is a threat to national security. They believe in a strong State Department and diplomacy because they do the jobs the Military needs done, but cannot do."	0
Unfortunately, uppity folks like you really seem to like to dismiss any new idea or concept. Either you must be a Punahou graduate or a very old person who cannot accept new concepts or ideas. This solution works fine, in the real world. Let me clue you in to reality, the concept of using insurance to serve a public purpose has been used many times. Remember hurricane insurance? This insurance proposal would be self regulating, a concept lost on the very stupid. The insurance companies would simply start to deny policies to those who lie about being in compliance with the law. Business people are rational, loosing a house or condo investment no longer becomes a good return if it can be easily taken away by a law suit. Also, no financial institution will give a mortgage for an uninsurable property. The trial lawyers will drool over the easy pickings, no insurance company lawyers to deal with. So no need any gov't folks, self policing works.	1

"Too bad you aren't our Parks Director Mike.

The City told my community they were going to build a ""comfort station"" for us although we didn't want it or need it. It said if you pay for your own playground equipment, we'll build it faster. It said you must have your own architect draw up the plans, you can't install the equipment yourselves because of liability, you must adopt the park and take care of it yourselves, you must let us put the equipment you paid for in another park, etc. I believe the City makes up these onerous rules along the way specifically to discourage communities from getting involved."	0

"From their website, ""The Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) is an independent, public corporation of the State of Alaska."" Which I believe is a fancy way of saying it is a public entity that is supposed to represent or serve the citizens of the State of Alaska. Please correct me with facts and sources if I am incorrect. Given this, if I am correct, their refusal to provide a copy of the agreement they signed in our name because it is not a ""public document"" is bloody obscene. Yet more evidence that Alaska has become little more than a corrupt banana republic run by dishonest oil companies through their chosen lackeys (who we are dumb enough to keep electing on the ""God, guns, and gynecology"" ticket instead of actual meaningful issues - which would of course require we pay attention). Honestly, if a deal is good enough to sign in our name (which is who the State is supposed to represent), it should be good enough to hold up to public scrutiny. If it can't, don't sign."	1
"Until a few weeks ago, the G&M published article after article denying the involvement of foreign (Chinese) money as the reason behind the property bubble in Vancouver and Toronto. The US and Australian press when covering their own bubble cities were open about the reasons why, and even threw in references to Vancouver as being a target of this money laundering strategy by Chinese interests. On this story, until a few days ago, there was no chance that the ""asylum seekers"" were going to be a trend, or something that could become an issue...according to people quoted, such as the Minister responsible. Well, I guess the good news is that at least the awakening has started now, as opposed to say August , when the headlines might be saying that ""last month X thousand walked across the border, and the minister insists this is not part of a trend""..."	0

Ascalepius, All ideologies put an emphasis on educating the youth unless they prefer them to be ignorant and thereby be manipulated. Are you implying that conservatives prefer the body politic to be ignorant to the facts? If so, I'd agree. As for the ration of liberals to conservatives, it's actually a non-point as Canadian conservatives are also liberal (small l). The distinction is between classical liberals and modern liberalism. The reason why so many professors are modern liberals is primarily because classical liberalism has been widely discounted as a failed theory with many experiments in the real world as demonstrations therein. I have been an academic all my life (38 now) and taught and/or attended 4 institutes of higher learning in Canada. In only one of them, York University, would their actually be a majority of Marxists, and that's just in the political science program. In the others, their was always principally a mix between classical and modern liberals.	1
I am probably one of those Siemian fans I guess, as I like him and I think he is the best option we have until Kelly gets healthy. He didn't play great game far from it. At first I thought he had terrible game ( he had bad game) so I went back and watched the game again and went through all passes he made. From what I counted there was 52 throws he completed 29 and 23 incomplete, two for picks. Out of 23 incomplete, there are 3 drops that should've been caught, one throw out of bound as no one was opened and he was chased, 1 throw that was forced as he was hit throwing the ball. Total completion rate 55%,if you would remove drops and out of bound that would make it 65%. Drops I count only balls when receiver is hit in the chest, by any definition receiver should be able to catch that. He made three terrible decisions, one was pick 6, second was not stepping into pocket but try to run out and getting sacked and third again running out of pocket to far. 1st pick was more bad throw.	0
John, I love this comment...just what our bishop would say! I've actually been thinking about this issue and contemplating a discussion with our bishop.

Why wait this long - the people responsible are dead.

Hillary Clinton did make Donald Trump possible. They are literally North and South Poles. Both are basically corrupt. Both are basically liars although I give the edge to Hillary on that score.

Because space in the print media is limited, some might appreciate more detail of the brief conversation with Mr. Glucklich. I believe its a mistake to require Oregon's citizens to get the government's permission to exercise certain constitutional rights, which is my base civil liberties objection to Mr. Prozanski's efforts. Also, I've said SUB's already existing -new- fiber optic network in Springfield -- circling all of Springfield -- can be contracted to provide *all* its citizens with internet easily 15 times faster with half the cost of what folks pay now. Bus service should be a competitive alternative to frequent auto use, which means more routes to and from places people need to go - and smaller, faster buses. And finally, the city needs fans, and should be given credit for its good works: It has fantastic citizen investments in parks, land, and recreation, affordable utilities, affordable housing, and murals like no other US city. It has room for young new ideas too.	0

George Orwell`s ""1984"" was off only about thirty three years late in it`s estimation of when ""Big Brother"" tells us lies become truth, and truth become lies, and we can only trust him to decide the difference. Not a bad guess for a late Victorian era novelist. This is why we need a free press.. a FREE press ""roots"" for the truth like hungry hogs until they find it. Putin already murders reporters who say the truth. We definitely do not want to be cozying up to that..do we? I highly recommend reading ""1984"" if by chance you haven`t."	0

The only peaceful way out of this is to give China the ultimatum that it replace Kim with an acceptable leader otherwise the US will ban Chinese trade and Chinese bank from using US financial institutions or otherwise trading in the US. International trade is primarily conducted in US dollars. It would be a immediate blow to the Chinese economy. So the Chinese choice is simple, crater NK leadership and replace it or crater the Chinese economy. The latter choice will bring greater social unrest than the former. The goal has to be settle NK without starting a war. There is a geopolitical wargame going on here. China wants control of the South China Sea and has stated it will support NK if NK is attacked first. At the same time Putin is moving troops closer to the former Soviet Republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and has obvious designs on the Ukraine. The US cannot fight a war on two fronts. Checkmate.	0
Thank you for this honest article. Yes. Optional Celibacy for married men while we are not ordaining married women equates to Gender Segregation & the subjugation of all women under all men no matter if we fully ordain a billion women to the permanent deaconate tomorrow. Permanent deacons have no authority, vote, voice or purpose beyond that of the laity in our church. The laity need to stand up against this evil attitude of exclusion & treating everything that the world has stereotyped female as less sacred, less intelligent, less deserving of same civil and sacred rights and sacraments now & with ferocity. This homily reveals a pope who has a real hatred of women as human beings. We are not a stereotype-we are human beings and are equally man to men. Work with Women's Ordination Conference to fight this gender segregation! We must stand against married priests until women are ordained equally priests as a matter of human dignity. We must also rebuke any ban on gay priests!	1

Me, you, everyone. You must question your belief in a religion if it incites violence based off ones interpretation. Christian’s blame all Muslims for how a small % interpret the Koran. The religious right follows their interpretation of the bible written by a man supposedly from God’s words; yet the same religious right make mock Mormons for Joseph Smith’s “vision” which led to the creation of the Book of Mormon. Westboro Baptist Church protest of military funerals, anti-gay picketing, and protest Jewish institutions, all under the name of God. A supreme being is seen in many forms, God, Buddha, Allah, Krishna, and each has zealots. If there is a supreme being, which one is it? Who is right and who is wrong? And as man, who are we to decide when we cannot even agree what “our” good book says? Man makes God, but man can never live up to Gods expectation.	0
One of our rights is to say what we think and believe and by doing so, accept the consequences. It really doesn't matter whether we know in some empirical way that we are right. If your argument is really that we should try to be fair when listening and talking with others I would agree. That, however, does not include accepting blatant lies just because someone spouts them. That is not respect , that is foolishness.	1

A politically stupid move on Trump's part. The reality is that the Paris accord does very little in reality ... I mean, trying to limit the heating to 2 degrees is too little in any case ... chances are, what we have already dumped into the climate system will take us above 2 degrees anyway, and, really, that alone would be catastrophic for the environment, leading to major droughts, bouts of extreme weather and melting ice that will flood Florida and some major cities over the next few decades. But by opting of an international agreement (that he can't *** really*** opt out of anyway, he is declaring that he doesn't care about his own grandchildren, never mind yours. He is denying that the ice caps are melting and he's declaring that he doesn't give a damn if they are. Politically, this is not a very wise move, ON TOP of the fact that it is politically unwise to discourage the growing green energy sector that is worth billions of dollars.	1

"In this country, the state we are not in, the last thing we need is simplistic blaming of complex problems on the right or the left, without any respect for real issues. This particular comment ""the only Islamophobia I have seen so far is coming from the liberal left"" is an example from one side. It is completely useless. Nobody who actually follows the issues and our current politics would put any stock in it. And it would be silly to offer counter arguments. It's just throwing acrimony into the pile. And the opposite, comments from the left that do the same thing, simplifying and blaming without thought, are just as bad. To improve politics in this country we need to work for common ground, not divide further. Both right and left need to figure out how we deal with the huge problem of Jihadism, and without sacrificing our principles, ideals, or constitution while we do. Here's hoping we figure that out, and that we stop wasting our time trying to blame one side or the other."	0
This is one situation the state will try very hard to keep from the public as the law suits proceed. I believe the state will do everything possible to keep it from getting to court to prevent the entire world from learning about how inept, incompetent, dumb, stupid, unprofessional, bungling, negligent, irresponsible and uncaring DHS is. Please feel free to add to the list anything I missed. To prevent the case from going to court, I believe the state will reach an out-of-court settlement for many millions of dollars and that the agreement will include a “confidentiality” clause to prevent tax payers from knowing the amount. Nothing will happen to the people in DHS responsible for this situation. They will continue employment with the state until retirement and live happily ever after.	1

Unfortunately leadership is non-existent with the Liberals on this issue. Not taking it to Caucus is an affront to their own party members. Delivering to the nation in mid-July when we were on vacation is another affront to the citizen's competence and capacity. The apparent absence of a willingness to debate the issues on their merits, but instead hide in demagoguery & divisiveness is the final confirmation that they are devoid of leadership. Leadership to many Canadians would be to kill wasteful government spending & reduce taxes. That takes considerable courage & determination, something which appears to be lacking in both JT & Morneau. The anger only boils as it becomes clear to Canadians that JT's 'family fortune' is not going to be affected, & More Dough Morneau's got so much money tucked away in so many off-shore corps that he still will never worry about payroll, the Bank or the house. They have shattered their credibility and they insult citizens with their hypocrisy.	1

This is why progressives/ moderates (Repubs, Dems and Independents) are contemptuous of so-called ""pro-lifers."" They lie about women regretting their abortions (Pew and others report women overwhelmingly are grateful they were able to terminate unwanted pregnancies); they lie about Planned Parenthood and all the work it does to help women's health; and they bear FALSE WITNESS against others so as to promote their agenda of taking people's rights away. If Rosa1984 feels that abortion is immoral then argue it from a truthful and factual point of view. Stop lying and bearing false witness! Christ didn't talk about abortion, but he spoke often about liars, hypocrites and those who bore false witness against their brothers/sisters. Also:Why don't people like Rosa1984 give their full names? Are they ashamed of the lies and ugly things they write on these message boards?"	1

There may be some that think that in your estimation, it is acceptable to firebomb and destroy businesses and cars as a show of contempt for the result of the election?

Part 2 Franciscan School of Theology emphasized God as Outpouring Love, and  our call is to live love each day. Bonaventure:  “We come from God reflecting the divine image, our DNA is found in God. Everything in creation is an example and illustration of the one God mystery in space and time. ..We return to the Source from which we came.” P. 166. “Grace is inherent in the universe from the moment of the “Big Bang”. (implied in Genesis 1:2, Spirit hovers over the chaos) Grace is “the very shape of the universe from the start.” In this view, ‘salvation is not a divine transaction that takes place because you are morally perfect but much more it is an organic unfolding, a becoming of who you are already are, an inborn sympathy with and capacity for the very One who created you….The Christ Mystery, …is plan A for God, and not a Plan B, a mop up exercise after Adam and Even ate the apple.” “For Scotus and for Bonaventure, the Trinity is the absolute beginning and ending point.	0

To Angus S Miskers-you and many of the commentors fail to understand the concept of comparative advantage in economics. You cannot have trade with a country where the comparative wages are vastly different. You can do this on some goods which are not key to your industrial strategy but certainly not autos. This was one of the major flaws with Nafta, autos and a whole host of parts should have been exempted from the agreement with Mexico. This was not in the interest of the US economy but clearly was a benefit to the large OEM's and certain parts suppliers.	0

No, you are wrong. Immigration as the Democrat party designed it is to replenish the democrat voting roles. If the 3rd World immigrants flooding the USA voted conservative, the democrats would be wailing to shut it down. We need limited immigration, and it must be based upon merit, and what immigrants are best for the USA. There are 400,000 South African whites of mainly Dutch and British heritage who are being systematically discriminated against in South Africa. They are living in shanty towns, because they can't get work. They are also being murdered by black South African thugs, just because they are white. This group would be the best immigrants we could get. They would fit in well with the traditional American ethnicity. And, we could shut down Muslim immigration to allow these South African whites to immigrate here.	1

"Laura... I strongly disagree with your statement that a ""salmon is a salmon"". A wild salmon eats natural foods (herring, squid, krill, plankton, etc...) ... a ranched salmon eats natural foods. A farmed atlantic salmon is not a pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus), it is an entirely different species... primarily a trout (Salmo), which is easier to farm. What does a farmed trout eat? It eats a diet manufactured by big business, primarily vegetable oil based (its cheap and fattens fish, cows, chickens, pigs very fast... oh, humans too). When it is getting close to harvest time, the farmed raised trout is given an ""enhanced"" diet, which entails color added chemicals (synthetic carotids) to produce a variety of pink/red tones (managers can choose the color from a color swatch from the feed manufacturers). If not dyed in this fashion, farmed salmon meat is gray. Most importantly, you can easily taste the difference. It is like eating ""pink slim"" hamburger vs a good elk burger."	0
Utility companies and the city do cut trees away from power lines. I've seen them working at it many many many times.

They don't cut down the trees in people's yards that unexpectedly dropped gigantic limbs onto individual power supply lines. As preventative maintenance for the next big storm, I hope that everyone accumulates adequate emergency supplies, and that everyone will have the trees on their property completely removed to prevent this from happening again.	0

Well, Richard, I feel free to judge the Jim Crow era in the US South. You may feel unwilling to do so. I also think that it's possible to review the documents from an era, and examine what people said (publicly and privately) and get a sense of their key motivations, and thus an understanding of their intent. Like, for example, taking the ordinances of secession (and the debates of the assemblies, and the newspaper declarations, and the private writings of their proponents), and understand that the key motivation for secession was the preservation of the institution of slavery. Many of those posting here seem to prefer relying on secondary sources that whitewash this.	0

Americans typically care very little for the plight of those with a mental illness. The hard evidence for this is present not just in Pueblo but all over the USA.

We all know he's a loose keg and not really as good as he thinks he is. Incidentally, that brings us around to Domata Peko. He's supposedly a heavyweight anchor the Broncos plan on dropping at the line of scrimmage to hold the opponents running game. This is just my cynical/jaded/jaundiced opinion but Peko ain't worth a pack of Pall Malls cigarette butts. Sure he might lend leadership skills and show others how to prepare.

"Why did you say ""thinly cloaked""? Was it to give your ""simple answer"" (which indeed it is) a veneer of sophistication? If so, your posturing has had the opposite effect, which is to let others see that you don't know the meaning of the phrase. In fact, Dr. Krugman posed a direct question. And the right answer is, that all four candidates are fighting for the votes of a majority of Americans who are ignorant, angrily opposed to educated rationality, unwilling to give up the slightest convenience, outraged to have their responsibility to future generations laid at their feet, and finally, more concerned with making a decent life for themselves in any way they can.

I like that rule but would also add that if a legislator tells a lie, they will just vaporize! Everybody talks about cuts with no actual advice to follow that statement. I've not heard any legislator talk about re-organization of our government through consolidating divisions with like interests and charges. Our government is just too big, brought to you by 3 decades of conservative people in office. I've made a lot of suggestions, probably to the point of being considered an idiot but our legislators just don't hear anyone unless it comes directly from their party heads. The rest of us common folks don't even matter, so it's hard to teach us to stand up when we just get told to lay down!	1
This city council has no principles or said another way, no b@lls! I was there, I filmed the meeting and it was clear that the actions of the deputy mayor were in violation of the rules. To make it worse she lied about the actions of Councilman Whetham. Citizens of Port Angeles, you get the government you deserve when you let your leaders get away with this type of leadership. Very sad. You deserve better. You will have the opportunity to vote out these bad apples as they come up for re-election or choose a new type of Government in 2017.

I don't know about Sweden. But I live in the US, and in particular Minnesota, and I assure you that the immigrants here, Somali, have made crime rise by a good margin. I am also not sure what the purpose of bringing up skin color is. This is not about being anti Arab. Christian Arabs have lived here for many, many years, and have NOT acted like this. In fact they really were refugees, running away from Islamic violence. Sadly it has now followed them here. The fact is that being overwhelmed by Muslim immigrants has many minuses, and absolutely no pluses. Yes, we do have cities in the US where you just can't make the crime rate any higher., but that isn't where the refugees choose to live. They insist on going to the best places in the USA, and making every one of them more dangerous. I would advise Sweden to NOt turn into New York. But tell me, if Sweden isn't experiencing a rise in crime, what about the rest of Europe? Like Germany? Can that be explained away too?	1

"You should have stopped with your opening confession. Oregon State has had a convicted felon wearing one of its baseball uniforms for the past three years. Some people find that odd and wonder how it can happen. Others find it disturbing. Still others insist it shouldn't matter. The original story was intended to be a feature, a celebratory puff piece, about a talented college pitcher who will soon turn professional and who plays for an outstanding team. A routine background check popped an important detail that couldn't and shouldn't be ignored. It has led to many more questions that have yet to be answered. Kill the messenger is the typical weak refrain in these circumstances. One very large, well-known organization has been practicing that tactic for a very long time.

It seems the Governor and our political leaders are going to extract operating funds from the Permanent Fund to cover the State's shortfalls. While this is not totally unreasonable, it does seem to be the easy way out. I would agree to it, but first I must see an earnest plan enacted to cut and reduce State spending or failing that, the Legislature will burn through the entire Permanent fund within five years, scrabbling over the last dollars until all is gone. Hope for the best, but anticipate the worst, especially if the Far East really jacks up their oil output and glut the market to the point of $13 per barrel. What are your plans then? How are you going to encourage people not to move out of Alaska? I see cuts being made to important human services totaling a few hundred thou here and a few hundred thous there, but then I look at the dalliance of our Legislator's building waste in Anchorage and you can see why people are get angry with such arrogant and unnecessary waste	0

Judge Gorsuch might be a man who thinks for himself and who cares about protecting his children from sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. Even though his mother was a strong Irish-American Catholic, from what I read about her, she was also very concerned that children be protected from sexual abuse. The fact that the judge was raised Catholic, and now has chosen to be a member of the Episcopal Church, makes me hope that he has learned of the ruthless tactics of the Catholic bishops in hiring lawyers that will do their bidding, so that they can continue to protect their predator clergy, and demoralize victims and their lawyers.

The ironic aspect of the situation is that Kaepernick's argument is deeply flawed. The USA has approximately 1 Million police officers. Statistically, it would be impossible for a percentage of that amount NOT to be either sociopaths/ psychopaths. Let's assume that 99.9% of Police hires range from Outstanding to Competent (an impossible goal). That would still leave 1,000 Incompetent (or worse) officers. If only 5% of the Incompetents executed a boneheaded, absolutely indefensible or criminal act in a given calendar year, then the media/social networks have at least one incident per week to bombard the masses with in demonstration of how bad America is. Bottom line...Bad people infest every occupation. Athletes, Judges, Politicians, Nurses, etc. Police are policed...Virtually every Police Department has an Internal Affairs section. Body Cameras are becoming widespread. Cops do get charged and go to jail if convicted. The alternate is no police. Was this Kaepernick's goal?	0

In light of the danger of this stalemate, the focus of the NDP in concert Federally & in each Province should be on making timely progress on the difficult task of devising & implementing a realistic transition plan to a sustainable greener Canadian economy with strong economic development & regional & job security through each stage of the transition. Giving Canadians generally (& (a) the environmental & labour elements within the NDP & (b) New Democrats in each region of Canada in particular) valid reason to believe that their environmental & personal economic interests & needs are being realistically addressed simultaneously, will remove important roadblocks to progress. If Canada can show that a balanced transition to this new economy is a realistic goal, then this fact will have an important positive impact on global attitudes & efforts.	0

But they didn't pass it. That's the point. And so DACA did not become law, because only Congress can write immigration law. Am I wrong? . If people want to enact legislation that takes the place of DACA, they have every right. Until then, they shouldn't be upset by the refusal to give effect to an invalid order. Rather, we --- all of us who believe in the rule of law --- should applaud the fact that an invalid law is not being followed.	0

Trump is a troll who loves nothing more than getting a huge reaction out of everyone. Unfortunately, there are some sick people out there. This really isn't anything new. People at his rallies have been calling for her to be executed for months. For using a private email account, like every other SOS before her, and for not saying that terrorists killed our ambassador the night it happened. Surely those are hanging offenses! Like all trolls, he stockpiles zingers and you can be sure he's brewing more. I'm pretty sure he'll get around to saying he understands why Bill cheated on her and accuse them of killing their enemies. A good percentage of his supporters believe she's a murderer. You can read them here, in this thread. The troll has something outrageous to say everyday.	1

"Quran (7:80-84) - ""...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)"". So the most intolerant and easily influenced followers of Islam feel that they have a duty to make that happen. And the others ... are not sure. Of course the Bible has a similar verse, but the New Testament then has a better message to love your neighbor and to love God. And that helps considerably, for most people. Muslims are a greater danger to gay people than Christians are. I stand with our gay brothers and sister in solidarity against Muslim terrorists."	1

Quite right, gewaite. The Orthodox in UK are just not overwhelmed by Anglican ecumenical overtures, especially since the Anglican Church has ordained women (bishops, no less) and allows civil unions between Anglican gay clerics, couples, including bishops. Was there recently and heard Anglicans complain about the cool politeness they get from Orthodox circles. (Ironically, the Orthodox Church, like the CC, doesn't even recognize Anglican orders, yet they complain, especially Russian Orthodox.) And Francis seems far more receptive to Anglican gay bishop/priest couples than the Orthodox since he commissioned pairs of male Anglican and Catholic bishops to work and pray together in their home countries (though, as I said, there were no pairs of women bishops, gay or straight, commissioned). Anyway, ecumenism is in the ice age as far as I can tell, even with Francis' good will gestures.	0

"James ""Not Wittingly"" Clapper is pond scum. The issue is revealing enough program details to make a criminal case in open court.

Ranting about ethics is what we do as a civilized society. Ethics or the lack of them separates us from those who simply hide behind the law and use it as a talisman to ward off any accusations of failing to live up to a higher standard. For perhaps the 20th time you and those like you still don't grasp the problem here. Fundraising is not the problem, it is what happens at the fundraisng and who is at the fundraisers that is the problem. I donate fairly heavily to a political party, I don't want to,and don't expect to meet anyone, and I certainly don't want anything. When the inner circle and the PM attend events with high price tags, the expectation is that certain topics will be raised. This is the part that people find wrong. The people attending the $1500 events are not raising the needs of the people , they are raising their needs. Each M.P. has a constituency office where they can listen to the needs of the people for free.	0

Precisely so. If life is the most precious possession that a human being can have, then allowing a murderer to continue to live (to take advantage of that most precious possession) makes a mockery of the value of the life stolen from the victim. As the victim has been denied every breath, every emotion, everything that makes living a gift, so should the one who took those gifts forever be denied that precious possession.	0

Our previous president didn't seem to show much empathy to the plight of all the violence in the inner cities (such as in Chicago). He rarely mentioned it. Drugs and gang violence run amok. At least our current president is recognizes the problems and is willing to attempt to slow down or curtail the flow of drugs into our country across the border. The family structure is so damaged today. We are seeing the results. So take off the blinders and tinted shades and at least give our current President a chance to change things!

The article mentioned that the inquiry has gone over well -covered ground. What else could there be ? There have already been over reports on the same issue, there really wasn't any possibility that new evidence would be revealed , or different findings. It was also unlikely that someone would come up with a new plan to locate those that are missing. It was never clear what the goals were ,other then the fact that the word answers was used by politicians and other stakeholders. It would be virtually impossible after this length of time that answers would be found, yet many of the participants had perhaps been unfairly led to believe that they would get answers. If anything the one answer that has emerged, is that this was not he way to conduct an inquiry.	0

"Who was that prominent racist GOP leader that privately stated that he believed “Barack Obama was well suited to a presidential run because he is a 'light-skinned' African American with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one."" But wait, wasn't that the then democratic leader of the Senate, Harry Reid? Another prominent Republican comes to mind who said ""A few years ago, this guy would have been serving us coffee."" But wait, that was the darling of the dem party, “Slick Willy” Clinton who said that. There is enough bigotry, racism, and corruption to go along with wholesale firing, blame and shame and humiliating resignation of the former leadership of the DNC.

"Your examples are NOT similar. The intent, the circumstances, and therefore the consequences are very different, because the baseline is very different. Women have been active socially and religiously from day one in western/Christian society, had an important role in its inception, participating in religious services next to men, instituting and leading religious orders themselves, mixing with men at country fairs and dances and church socials, balls and banquets and court life, organizing dinner parties and salons, etc. It wasn't a stretch to go from this baseline to modern feminism. Meanwhile, in Muslim countries, women were hidden in back rooms and behind veils and partitions, observers but not participants.

Germany was like before OUR President, Ronald Reagan took care of that problem for good !!!! Ungreatful !!!!	1

Deliciously catty, Tabby, with the sarcasms laid on with a trowel so thickly that Senator (May the Saints Preserve Us) Beyak might even catch your drift. It is possible she'll wake up and notice a few scratches in the morning. Still, considering the superbly-conditioned nutbars she has to compete with in the Circus to the South, the best we here in the Global Wingnut Committee can award her is a Bronze Meddle.

"In a political context to ""support"" someone means to endorse him or her. The definition of support includes : ...""to uphold (a person, cause, policy, etc.) by aid, countenance, one's vote, etc.; back; second.""; to maintain or advocate (a theory, principle, etc.).""  Of course it would be more straightforward to just come out and SAY that you endorse someone, but weasel-wording allows some people to play stupid. Or to just plain be stupid."	1

Star Adv get full details? lol!! Whatever they get will be filtered down to nothing. It won't fit the narrative. Instead they will probably blame Trump for it all! This thing needs a full-blown FBI investigation of everything to date. Track the money, the hollow promises, everything. Just follow the money, and it will become transparent. Audit everybody and everything for the last 5 years that had any connection to this thing. Money leaves a trail...follow it! And check all recent purchases of land, real estate by the rail stations. That alone would be very interesting! A forensic FBI investigation is their much needed medicine that they have to take now. Nobody can believe in anything they say. Continuing to talk to the guys that made this mess is useless.	0
Yet another demonstration of the feckless fool. He praises Putin, Erdogan and LePen and antagonizes our closest democratic neighbors.

"I agree with you that the bill never have been put up for a vote but not for the same reason as you. I believe the bill never should have been put up for a vote for humane reasons not political ones. I also agree with you that there are a large number of people that are being hurt by the ACA but conversely there are larger number (I believe) that are being helped by the ACA: people that have never been able to afford insurance before but now can because of the ACA subsidies that are put in place, and people that have pre-existing condition that can't be turned away by insurers under the ACA. If the Republicans can pull a rabbit out of a hat and deliver what Trump promised on the campaign trail, I am all for that. Just in case you forgot, Trump promised, and these are quotes: ""Insurance for everybody"", with no cuts to Medicare & Medicaid: ""“I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid”, ""No one will lose coverage""."	0
Sure, blame this on Trump and not the ridiculous ACA. Hopefully they just let this thing die its ugly death.	1
If the leftists had just let the 'white supremacists' have their rally, nobody would have noticed. But as spoiled children, leftist scum had to react immaturely, thus making situation far worse.

My father, a legal immigrant from England, was well-educated, and comes from upper middle class. he tried to use drugs to sedate the demons that plagued his mind, and ended up taking his life when I was 3 months old. He had all the best help money can buy. Bottom line, you're never going to save people like him. a cold reality some folks struggle to accept. Then there are people like my Chickasaw grandpa, a dead end leech who drank heavily. There isn't a program out there that will ever save his kind. They need to be removed from society, prison, just like my grandfather, so they cannot inflict their criminal dysfunction on society. what few understand is drugs/alcohol are not the problem, they merely exacerbate what already exists.	1
You obviously don't all the facts. The City staff were duplicitous in their dealings with the nearby neighbors, as well as the parents of elementary school students. This created a legitimate air od mistrust. I worked with one of the OVE principals throughout, trying to help work out a satisfactory arrangement. That person acknowledged that the City staff had stalled them so that OVE felt they had to rush the project before winter weather, without (in hindsight) allowing enough time to work with neighbors and the school. She understood why things had gone south a lot better than you ever will. Like so many people, you're quick to jump to unfair characterizations of good folks who have a right to ensure the safety and livability of their neighborhood.

The Forest Service and the B.L.M has banned most poison spraying since the 90's and manage to get by just fine. Invasive species can be a huge problem, especially if they are left to thrive. Timely replanting followed up with routine brush release works well in most cases. Sure if the Himalayan blackberries reach 10 feet in height then it is a real mess to clean up. It is possible to hand eradicate them but it is hugely expensive. An example of this happened at the Delta Ponds behind Valley River. Crews first went and cut the stems in small pieces then another crew followed up digging out the 'corms'. then replanted with various species. Once an old growth of berries, they a virtually gone. I really don't have much problem with herbicides used judiciously. They are best used way before the plants become a 10 foot tall jungle. Arial spraying is usually not necessary. It's wasteful, reckless and takes away jobs.	0

Smoke and Mirrors...these guys have been pulling this off for the last 30 years. What they really want is to take the last drop of oil out of Alaska, pay no taxes, and get Alaska's citizens to pay for the priviledge of delivering the profits to their shareholders, wherever they may be. A few points: 1.It's Alaska's oil, not industry's. We own it, and it is to be developed for our benefit, per our Constitution. 2. Every barrel that comes from our land should pay us a royalty and a tax for the income derived. 3. It is ridiculous to expect that Alaskans should pay one red cent to subsidize multinational corporations to extract non-renewable resources from our state. 4. A resident of Alaska for the last 46 years, am outraged that the oil industry has consistantly managed to subvert and commandeer my State government to act against my and my fellow Alaskans' best interests, sowing the seeds of discontent and divisiveness as they go to obfuscate their greed and selfishness.	0
I hope that the British Parliament refuses to vote in favour of Brexit. This would be a courageous act by parliament in the parent of parliamentary democracies, by NOT following a referendum which was not binding and whose consequences appear now to be mostly negative, particularly for British youth, and for the integrity of the British union. This referendum and the one in Vancouver about extending its LRT system, illustrate the pitfalls of referenda. In my view they represent an abdication of responsibility by elected representatives. At best they should serve as a poll of opinion and only should be given significant weight if there was a huge turnout (say at least 75%) of the illegible voters. They are not part of our parliamentary democracy, and should not be. I hope that there will not be one over the institution of proportional representation, should our PM actually show he has the integrity to follow through with this election promise.	0

Wow- what a silly article. Our tax system is very simple if you are a normal taxpayer. It gets even simpler when you use readily available tax software. I buy stocks, I pay dividends from my company and I also file the US taxes for my wife and kids. Canadian taxes (especially compared to US) are very simple. What the author is really complaining about is the level of taxation in Canada - which is more than the US until you add the incredibly complicated and expensive health premiums in the US. Then it comes out close to even. Our system, especially since I can access it online for my personal and companies, is head and shoulders ahead of others.	1

Trevorlittle is Trevor Siemian when he plays cautiously, afraid to make a mistake, afraid to take a chance. Trevorlittle is mediocre. As far as quarterbacks, it seems that Kyle Sloter was lost when Denver didn't want to put the gunslinger on the roster. Then Denver's big gun, the NFL grand-daddy, John Elway, gave Sloter what must have been a condescending, patronizing speech about how small-school, inexperienced players like Sloter don't make the jump to the big-time NFL, especially against big-time NFL defenders. All Sloter did was to prove himself at every turn. Sloter should have been kept even if it meant $50,000 a week on the practice roster. Whatever, it doesn't seem the magic that Sloter possessed, to spark his teammates to glory, to crank up Denver's offense and to control the ball and score, no, that moment has come and gone. Now there's Trevorlittle willing but unable. We have Brock Osweiler, a castoff among former teammates, and Paxton Lynch, a sorry, busted-down, no-talent.	1

"Oh, the poor little snowflakes... still incapable of getting over the idea that the country doesn't owe the lion's share of everything to keep them happy and comfortable. Whites are the least targeted ethnicity in the entire country - but nooo, let's claim ""victimhood"" because some white jackass in a restaurant wasn't allowed his NP-given right to use violence to protect his toxic masculinity from a black woman's words. The number of Afrikaans-speakers have been growing (which those types in the picture conveniently ignores because non-white Afrikaans speakers now outnumber white ones) - but noooo, let's claim victimhood because it doesn't get treated as if it's the only language that should be spoken in South Africa (when in reality it's still only the third most spoken language). Really. Instead of pretending to be the ""master race"", maybe a large portion of white people in this country could actually start using what is situated in-between their ears.

"A foreign citizen has no human right to violate the laws of our Union and unlawfully take up residence here. That you believe they do is anything but a ""progressive"" viewpoint and, in fact, is the root of the problem. Arapio wasn't denying the lawbreakers right to a fair judicial system, he was seeking to make sure lawbreakers were given their day in immigration court. And yes, like our founders and the generations which followed it, sometimes it is necessary to violate unjust laws and ignore the orders of the courts to effect change. You would agree that this is precisely what MLK and others did in the 1960s and the abolitionists did in the middle 1800s, wouldn't you? They ignored the laws and the courts which told them they must do the wrong thing. Now, you and I might agree with the courts in this instance, but you can surely see that there are others who might not and choose to practice time honored civil disobedience instead, can't you?"	0

Take a poor backward country ruled by a military dictatorship. Particularly a foreign-controlled military dictatorship. Add a religious majority and another religious minority. Voila - a simple and quick recipe for civil war and genocide. These atrocities are as old as religion, the world's oldest con game and the military, the world's oldest professional killers. The British have been inciting these religious wars for centuries and now the Americans as well. They are amazing for the lucrative business of the military-industrial Establishment. And now the refugees and immigrants are fantastic for cheap labour. We can have democracy or we can have undue influence of conflicting diverse religions. We can't have both. Shame on Canada for choosing wars and religions. I might add, after the end of the Cold War the US wanted a new enemy to fight - for power, for profits, for domestic control. They started a war on Islam. The rest is the history of blood and treasure gone up in smoke.	0

That is right. There are no fine people who are Neo-Nazis or White Supremacist, they are all poor quality individuals. Racist and bigots do not get a pass. BLM didn't say they are anti-white, they said stop killing us because we are black; there is a difference. People threatening the presidency is a completely different issue. These are all different and it is easy to separate the racist bigotry from the group and it can be treated as a unique problem exclusively.	1

Nate, you might want to study the case of Brian Banks. You say that the rape was not alleged. You are wrong. The sexual contact was not alleged - all parties admitted to it. The woman said it was rape, the three players said it wasn't. I read the police reports as published in the RG in their entirety. There was no case to file charges. There was no way the DA could have obtained a conviction. I have no idea if she was raped. And neither do you, unless you are her posting under an assumed name.

I'm all for free trade however the Mexicans are the problem with NAFTA. For example: their very weak labour laws allow auto makers to make sweetheart deals with employer unions. In turn auto workers in Mexico are paid less than auto workers in China. These cars then get exported to Canada and the U.S. barrier free. If I was an auto maker I'd be a moving production to Mexico where I could pay $3.00/hr rather than Ontario where the going rate is $30/hr+ with benefits.	0

Henry Ford had a business philosophy that was brilliant and it truly did make America great. His idea that he would build a product that the public could afford and he would pay workers enough so they could purchase the very products they were producing was the beginning of America becoming a super power. Now corporate and union greed has determined that they can make a cars cheaper some where else. Car companies can't afford the union workers wages and corporations are always looking to lower the bottom line. Who then will be able to purchase the product? Trump is right that jobs have to stay in America. If you want to sell there then product should be produced there. He is turning back years of the USA neglecting itself. Yeah he's far far from perfect but is a smooth talking PC politician any better if their policies are wrong? Frankly I'm real tired of the politically correct that get nothing done or get the wrong things done.	0

Sewer backup is not the same as overland flooding. Insufficient drainage from the soil (and yes excessive rain) is a development / landscaping issue for the most part. Obviously bad things can happen even after doing all the right things. Those scenarios are usually larger scale and beyond the scope of what most people would consider reasonable measures. Rick's point is valid - the water issues that most people encounter are directly related to poor planning. Some due to history and geography )i.e. the tendency for towns and cities to have their origins near major water bodies); unfortunately many others are simply a function of poor development and design.	0
The citizens of Hawaii must demand of the Federal Government and Trump to use some of his plan to greatly increase military funding on a crash program to create a beefed up, multiple layered, and impenetrable ABM barrier.

"So rather than native leaders expecting their people to do better, to be better, they want the laws softened so the criminals don't face as much time when they get caught? That's like saying, ""my people are going to commit crimes no matter what but they shouldn't have to face such harsh consequences"". It would seem to me that more attention should be given to the mentality that is leading them to break the law on such a disproportionate level than trying to get them off with lighter sentences.

"I have to laugh at Mr. Eastburn's saying the civilian assault rifles look ""little different"" then a semi-auto hunting rifle. They look a lot different, in fact, what they look like are military assault rifles and carbines, and their purpose isn't for hunting, it is for ""big boys"" to ""play war"" with. The AR-15 was the progenitor of the M-16 and M-4, and they are identical in operation except for selective fire, they have similar high-capacity quick replace magazines, the same deadly power and accuracy, and the same capability to kill many people in a very short time. Semi-auto hunting rifles in most states are limited to 5 shots before reloading, and seldom are more needed. We call those Cabela's military style rifles ""civilian assault rifles"" because they are primarily owned by civilians, and they are the weapon of choice for assaults upon multiple civilians. If it looks like a duck and it shoots like a duck, it probably is a duck."	1

Shoot my dog if he is charging you with teeth bared ! The home owner is 100% wrong blaming Mr. Mellerstig for shooting his dog when he charged at him with teeth bared. Mr. Brailey is negligent having an invisible fence- which is INVISIBLE to someone walking by- all they see is the threat of a charging snarling dog. His body was half outside the property line so that tells you it did NOT stop him. I have 2 huge black dogs inside a fence with 6 ft. gates. They will bark and run the fence to let you know they are standing their ground. If one were to get out and charge at you barking I would not blame you if you shot him. If you had a child with you, I would be remorseful that my dog caused you to fear for your child. To the people that get so bent out of shape over a dog being shot- what would you do if a MOOSE were charging you and your child with his head down, ears back- no doubt what his attempt was-to mow you down and stomp you. You would shoot him...would you not ?	1

Maybe instead of griping and complaining you might educate yourself (as you clearly need it) on some of these questions you ask.	0

@Ed09: I would suggest this is worth reading - https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/feb/28/un-report-lays-bare-the-waste-of-treating-homes-as-commodities Exceedingly cheap money has changed the game since around the turn of the century and in particular since the US housing bust. This hyper-inflation of assets, in particular in real estate, is disproportionately harmful to younger people, who now cannot achieve a standard of life that was available even ten years ago based on their present earning potential. The problem is particularly pronounced in Canada because of our permissible approach to citizens of convenience (sheltering foreign wealth is a large part of our economy now) and the massive devaluation of our currency relative to other monies just at a time when global wealth was looking for a home.	0

"Yes, Copps, Boudria, Tobin, et al were quite the ""young turks""of that time. But I did appreciate Brian Tobin manning up at a seminar to mark NAFTA's 20th anniversary when he faced PM Mulroney and said Mulroney was right and he was wrong about NAFTA. I should point out that while the new president Clinton and the new PM Chretien signed the new NAFTA agreement, the actual concepts and negotiations work was done by the Mulroney and the Bush #41 administrations. (Like when Trudeau 2.0 and Freelander claimed success for the largest trade deal in history - between Canada and the EU - which was actually over 90% done by the Harper administration.) You see the spin here? In the 18 months give or take that a new NAFTA is being negotiated, any criticism on any Liberal policy or decision whatsoever will be claimed by Liberal hyper-partisans to be aimed at defeating the trade negotiations.

Normally I would not recommend this, but in Jack's circumstances I think it's worth serious consideration - because he doesn't wish to pass along anything from his estate after he dies AND he is concerned about longevity due to his good health - I think he should consider an annuity. Rates are low - I know, I know - but he is now 71 and much of his annuity payout will be more closely tied to his remaining life expectancy (versus interest rates). With the $180k from his RRSP he could convert to a single, male annuity (with no guarantee) of approximately $1,000-1,100 per month - for the rest of his life regardless of interest rates, market returns, etc. In addition, this is an opportune time to convert because he needs to move out of his RRSP this year (he has turned 71) AND converting to an annuity would do away with his concern about management fees and which investment management option to use after he converts his funds. Just a suggestion - all the best, Jack.	0

The solutions have long been there for the bishops, but sadly, they refuse to see. Welcome back all those priests who left the ministry to marry, but still long to serve.  Allow those priests who wish, to marry. Open the priesthood up to the 50% of the population the church today rejects for this position. See the laity as an equal to the clergy, and treat them accordingly. And above all: learn how to listen and meet people where they are, not demand that the laity live up to sterile standards that haven't made sense since the Middle Ages. Let the lived spirituality of the laity teach the clergy.	0

I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but I honestly believe Hillary Clinton's defeat had little to do with sexism. I'm sure there was some of that (and probably always will be), but when I've talked with even people who despise Clinton, the fact that she was a woman never really came up. It was more about the emails, Clinton-fatigue, abortion -- stuff like that. Let's be honest. Clinton had some major liabilities as a candidate and those, along with this massive current of discontent in the country, were what did her in. If that weren't true, could somebody like Donald Trump really have beaten her? Believe me, I'm as sick over Trump's election as anybody. I just think there are a lot of other reasons why it happened besides sexism.	0

Thank you, CB, for recognizing the importance of civilian protests. Wish that I had been able to participate. There something energizing in protesting falseness. OBAMA can rightfully increase protection of ocean areas, but is he ignoring the appeal of the Sioux in North Dakota trying to protect their water from a Corp of Engineer approval of a Canadian Pipeline? Evidently corrupt ND Senators have invested in 68 different oil producing wells in North Dakota. PopularResistance.org Sept. 2,2016. We know that fracking causes earthquakes. Where is Obamas Justice Department? The Sioux are being attacked by vicious dogs, sacred sites are being bulldozed. How about sending in the National Guard to protect the Sioux Rights? Of the course the military is destroying the planet, not protecting.	0

"Refugees. Immigrants. Once these people become 'visible minorities' as you call them, there's no difference. How do you put a price on preserving your culture? What Canada is doing is not plain old immigration. It's an advertising campaign to conquer the world with the most immigration of any country. It's projected that in a few decades immigrants and their children will outnumber non-immigrants. Why is that desirable and why is it evil and unspeakable to want to preserve western traditions and culture? The Canadian PM has already said something similar to ""Canada has no identity"". It's becoming a mailing address."	0

"Without going to a single payer/universal coverage system, health insurance will ALWAYS be rated based upon the cost of services where a person lives, PERIOD!!! Buying insurance across state lines as a way to save large sums of premium dollars is one of the biggest cons the right has perpetuated over the years. Insurance will always be rated based upon the cost of services where a person is seeking treatment, so if you want Alaska care, you are stuck with the high cost of delivering those services in this state. If you want lower 48 costs, one needs to move to the lower 48 because that is where your care costs are rated. The only other version of ""buying insurance across state lines"" to reduce costs, is called single payer/universal coverage."	0

Finally certifying the legal justification for a Corporate Oligarchy reign of economic and election terror with the Corporate Citizen ruling letting loose the Billionaire Bankers to buy all elections at any level. The dog-and-pony show hasn't even asked the real questions of Supreme Court Scalia actions treasonous to the Constitution and all human and civil rights contained therein. Worst of all, this judge believes in the superiority of Christian religion over all governing systems. The worst traitorous ideology of all.	1

You might argue that there is no conflict of interest when a friend is a WITNESS. But what happens if he goes on to become the subject of investigation, for leaks or for perjury?

I think you view the Church's perspective as referring to homosexuals and not their acts is because homosexuals define themselves by the acts that they engage in; there is no separation between the act and the person. I have sex with my wife, yes, for self-gratification. But I married my wife to have children and form a family, not to have a sex partner. I suppose there is some bonding element to the act, seeing that is how our children were conceived, but we do not engage in sodomy of any sort even though that would feel good. She is disgusted by the thought of it, and I am quite satisfied with using my body the way it is clearly intended to be used. I think that God (or evolution, for the secularists) has made it pretty clear that we're not supposed to use our sex organs for recreation. We need only look at the sexual ills of our society (STDs, adultery, porn, teen pregnancy, single motherhood, pedophilia, gay bathhouses, prostitution, etc....) to see what is right and intended	1

Our tradition is that the president doesn't fire the director of the FBI, partly because investigation and indictment is separate from prosecution, which is the duty of the Atty Gen. On that note, it's time for all you people to stop flogging a dead horse, which Clinton is. Clapper may have responsibility but it is delegated. Some to the CIA, some to the FBI, some to other agencies including, probably, the diplomatic corps. All those investigations happen apace, Clapper had no direct involvement, only oversight. Trump said he fired Comey over his ruining of the Clinton Campaign, when in fact, Trump thanked Comey after Clinton's loss. Then three months later he uses the same loss to fire Comey. That's obviously a lie. Trump had been screaming at his TV over a week of Trump/Russia testimony, then he fired Comey. He fired Comey to stop the investigation. To believe otherwise is to be a total, self-deluded, wishful thinking chump. It's time to get real. You are a chump. Don't be.	1

Why Out? I agree completely that there is an 'arrogance' of intelligence, but that is hardly always liberal or democratic. And just as an athlete can shove a nerds head in toilet, because he can, those gifted with great intelligence can try to lord it over others and not listen with any empathy to the challenges facing the less intelligent or unschooled. But given the choice of an option that I know is researched by sincere people, or depending on populist rhetoric from a no nothing, I'm going with the educated opinion- hopefully with a touch of skepticism. Elite skills are hard to find in any profession. Expertise is a value. Your work is requires elite skills from what I can gather by your post. Elite is not a pejorative adjective. I'm glad you recognize that Trump isn't a member of the intellectually elite. Why that pleases you has more to do with your cynical nature than Trumps skills as a leader. *I have a cynical side as well, not meant as a slam.	1

For thirty years we have seen the rise of a right wing media dead set on misinforming and disinforming the American audience to the point that viewers/listeners cannot separate the truth from the lies anymore. We have trump because of the dishonesty of the entire spectrum of right wing media. Shame on us as a nation for giving up the search for truth for the sake of garbage reporting that reinforces prejudices, hatreds and fears. We are better people.

Long before doctors connected the dots between smoking and cancer, they knew from the very beginning it caused emphysema, yet in the same breath the Surgeon general suggested smoking was in fact good for you. While I'd like to believe times have changed with government being more truthful, here we sit decades later, with our current government on the one hand saying they indeed recognize the dangers of drugs and their addictive properties, yet allowing the sale of said drugs within our community in the name of profits. So what kind of lesson is that teaching? If we want kids to understand the difference between right and wrong, good or bad, then I strongly suggest we get them out of public schools, because they will not learn those things there, nor is it the job of government to be teaching such things in the first place.	0

I can understand quite well where you don't even remember what you claim earlier that everyone will use it and now you claim not everyone will use it, make up you're mind. You haven't rebutt my comment as to why families that have kids have other activities after school, will not use rail because it will take too much of their time and inconvenient. Do you agree? Will you be using rail since you claim it will be a blaze by people sitting in traffic and that's not even correct, if you're sitting in traffic that means you're not moving which is not the correct scenario, you pro raiders should say moving at a slow pace , okay?	0
Good for the GOP, the extortion racket known as the Oregon Democratic Party has no business pushing so many huge bills through the short session. Just like they abuse the emergency clause, Democrats abuse the short session to limit debate and prevent proper analysis. The reason is obvious: If the actual effects of the bills the Democrats want to shove down our throats were properly analyzed and understood they would be much less popular. The Democratic extortion racket mistakes their gerrymandered legislative majority for a decisive mandate to push disastrous legislation. We should make them pay at the ballot box.	0
it was a good day for trump Comey came out and said there was no investigation of trump no collusion between him and the Russians so all you cnn, msnbc abc cbs nbc and all you NY times and Washington post and AP and SA on your views you all got debunked by Comey and so did all you libs who made comments about trump being tied to the Russians all you guys got egg on your face with all that fake news the last few months, and Comey should be investigated on other stuff that he said and leaked he came in there and acted like the victim. so all you media people and trump haters get out your Kleenex and start crying because you made fools out of yourselves the last few months.

Sarah gave it his best shot, but he was no match for a Pope who respected Vatican II, even though the council fathers are mostly dead now. He had the ear of Benedict, but Benedict abdicated and whether he tried going to Franics first or not, he has been rebuffed by the Vicar of Christ. The Magisterium of Pope Francis is now clear and of the Church as well. Unless you wish to commit the mortal sin of sedevacantism, I suggest you practice saying ”and also with you.”	0

As you say, Martin's an unprincipled smear journalist. Bernier is the Conservative candidate he is afraid of so he naturally wants to put him in the same basket with a social conservative like Brad Trost even though they represent quite different strands of the Conservative Party. (And Trost is hardly Attila the Hun, even though the Liberals, with their shrill divisive rhetoric, want to paint him that way.) Also Martin's a lazy journalist. He probably isn't even aware of Bernier's policy proposal to lower the Bank of Canada's target rate of inflation and if he were he wouldn't have the patience to try to properly appreciate it.	0
I worked my way through the UO. I didn't benefit from being a minority. The truth is that when I made it clear that I didn't come here to play football, I was not able to see an academic advisor until I got to grad school. My father sent me packing when I was 16. I'm a self made man. As a vocational counselor I helped about 13,000 Lane Co. residents find work. About 90% of them were white. I'm retired now so I don't need to coddle white folks to be employed. If you are female, you can benefit from Affirmative Action. The truth is more white women got work and college educations from that program than black people. Maybe you should have studied harder in school. Have you heard of Title 9. It was to help women go to college. That is why there are women sports programs on every campus. The 21st century is not kind to the poorly educated.	0

You only mention how it doesn't meet your attractiveness quotient and it's holding you back from getting everything you want out of life but you don't mention if it's also holding her back. Do you care about her happiness at all in this? If you do, more than your letter reveals, then talk to her about what your own goals are for your life and that you'd like her part of that, you at least acknowledge that. And ask her what she wants. Then start with something you can accomplish together and start setting mutual goals. If you find that you're both truly in different places and there's no mutual interest in finding common ground and working together, set each other free. But at least give the relationship the effort of having the conversation.	0

I am sure overwhelming majority of the officers out there probably feel bit ashamed and unease how quickly those two were culled out of the herd and line up to be slaughter. It could happens to any one of them. All it took was one corrupt police chief to unloose the chain of shame. Maybe their union might speak out although that union didn't seem to speak too loudly during the process. I worked 27 years for DOC Alaska. We had our shares of bad apples.

By the way each time the planet has gone into warming usually from the explosion of a super volcano, an ice age followed. Man himself did not cause the previous warning but the one we are undergoing now is from the unwise continued use of fossil fuels that the greedy petroleum industry continues to promote. It is very interesting that there was a hostile share holder proposition passed during the last Mobile oil meeting forcing Moble to make yearly progress away from fossil fuel and asking them to finance more authentic research by Universities not controlled by the Mobile dollar.

What Mr. Gehring saw, although he will never admit it, were people who disagree with him (and me) on the interpretation of Catholic teaching and its implementation. It has been the constant position of NCR that people who disagree are entitled to a place at the table without being demonized -- a precedent set rather early by the decision to include not one, but four gospels that portray Jesus' life and teaching in different lights. The idea that people who disagree with us are hypocrites is one of the most sophomoric ideas possible.	1
Surely the way that the ANC sees the function of parliament makes the institution redundant. Their MPs do not hold the executive to account and merely act in a rubber stamping function.

MPs must be made accountable to the voters Westminster style, then we will see proper parliamentry function.	1

[Income tax wont deal with the problem.] The state can only cut so much before it starts magnifying the problem rather than fixing it. I'm with you that a tax isn't a complete solution but draining the coffers more slowly may be a necessary step to take. What I'd like to see is a budget based upon $40/bbl and adjustments to the current royalties and tax on production to get our 1/3rd of gross revenue we're supposed to get from our mineral wealth. The latter is far easier to accomplish but to all appearances it seems the Senate is determined to cater to the oil industries with things like the proposed $300,000,000 expenditure.	0

Sea food restaurants advertise the ""icy waters of Alaska,"" they're icy, and if your body goes into those waters you almost immediately go into shock. Most deaths come from the gasp from hitting the water that results in ingesting water. Your life is worth at least $50, so buy a PFD and wear it!"	0

Interesting logic but it does not address the custom of the governing party providing the speaker. If that tradition is upheld a Liberal speaker would step down if the government falls. The author seems to think that the elected speaker has an obligation to stay on even when governments fall. If that is the case the Liberals have even less incentive to provide a speaker than they have now. Since the Liberals have not nominated a speaker yet I anticipate they will stand firm. There will be no speaker from Liberal ranks come June 22 unless the NDP make some sort of side agreement. If the NDP does not blink parliament will not sit, leaving it to the Lieutenant Governor to resolve the matter.	0

AMERICAN GREED.	1
That wasn't my understanding of Tsilqot'in. The FN claimed a large area. The judge at trial awarded them a portion of their claim, based on the test provided by the SCOC in past decisions, including Delgamuukw. When the Tsilqot'in decision was adjudicated by the SCOC the court agreed with the trial judge's opinion that title was proven. The Chief Justice, who wrote the decision went on to reiterate in her own words what had been written in several past decisions..that first nations do not have a veto and that government can infringe on title for legitimate reasons. The overriding message of the SCOC in many decisions since Delgamuukw is that we are all here to stay, so we had better start working on how to co-exist peacefully.	0

""",,,the majority of Europe's Catholic bishops supported the Nazi 'solution.'"" At least come up with a scholar or two to support the idea that Europe's bishops supported the Nazi ""solution."" They were silent and indifferent (not believing Jews were neighbors), but they did not openly support death camps, if only because Jewish Catholic converts were being rounded up with fellow Jews and sent to the same gas chambers. For starters I suggest you read Michael Burleigh's SACRED CAUSES (Harper Collins, 2006). ""It is no wonder that Germany became so Protestant."" Not today. According to Pew Research Center 2017 study; ""Five centuries after reformation catholic protestant divide in western Europe,"" only 28% of Germany identifies as Protestant (42% as Catholic). Luther's 1543 book, ON JEWS AND THEIR LIES, however, did serve as a blueprint for the Nazis' KRISTALLNACHT of 1938, recommending synagogues be burnt, Jewish lit. be confiscated, and vengeance taken on Jews. Nazis exploited Luther."	1

Hey sukiyucky, still obsessed with Hillary? She's a private citizen that the Trump camp of nut cases what you uneducated idiots to keep focussing on. And it's working. The fastest way to find out if someone is a Trump supporter is to check their educational background. You, I would guess, barely got through high school, never studied, but are one of the masses that kept getting passed from grade to grade because no teacher could deal with you for more than 9 months. However, you seem dumb enough to have enrolled at Trump University, so maybe you did advance beyond grade 12. One other point. Private citizens get passes all the time. Trump got lots of passes as a bankrupt business guy, but remember, he is our baby-in-chief now, so we get to scrutinize him. Just like you guys scrutinized Obama.

This will cost millions, but won't actually increase voter turnout. You can register people, but if they haven't already registered - which is very easy to do - is it really likely that they'll vote? We already have voter turnout that rarely rises above 70% of registered voters. I haven't yet seen any proponent of this initiative explain how it will increase actual voter turnout. I don't agree with GOP opponents of the initiative that it will increase voter fraud; I think that's a situation that's very uncommon. But I do think it's a large expenditure of money for no clear purpose.	0

So, basically what you're saying is that women, (particularly, although I also know some teenage boys) who prefer privacy while peeing are somehow mentally ill and must be ripped out of their insanity by a six-foot male in 4-inch heels goggling them over the top of a public restroom stall. (And, yes, I have had that experience and know other women who have had it also). These fearful and unfair people who think their body shouldn't be under public display of the opposite sex will get used to being goggled and their daughters won't even think it's unusual and the whole world will be better off for them getting used to being sexually harassed. And, hey, the occasional sexual molestation of children ... that will only grow the number of transgendered, so it will meet your goal and that means there's nothing to worry about.	1

Oh and your argument is idiotic. If a party of and for the rich couldn't win elections in America the GOP would not have had any presidents at all after Teddy Roosevelt - the last liberal republican president. Yet they've won often in the century since. By having all the wealthy votes and convincing half the poor people that their problems are caused by other poor people rather than policies which unjustly favor the rich. The only difference was that Trump named those people. But the story was always the same. Do you think Reagan's 'welfare queen' was white? But Reagan and the Bushes spoke of 'welfare queens' and 'gang violence' and 'radical Islamic terrorism' . Trump just said 'Mexicans and Muslims'. That's not a change. It means the exact same thing. It's what conservatives have always voted for. Remember we had a conservative party in South Africa too : the guys who left the National party because apartheid wasn't racist enough for them!	1

You are probably correct but it that is no excuse for supporting Trump. Trump will go down in history as the candidate that was elected because people didn't want to vote for the other person not because he was a good candidate.

REFERENDUM 2019: Canada is an example of how democracy can be in name only. A true democracy would hold a referendum on immigration/refugees/TFW programs with full information on how much the programs are costing Canadian taxpayers (30+ billion annually) and what benefit they get (more competition for fewer jobs, declining wages, overburdened social system, higher taxes, sociopolitical chasms, declining human rights). A true democracy would weigh the cost to the host society who is paying the bills, the failure of job creation to keep up with population growth due to high inmigration (the economy would have to be creating 25,000 jobs a month) and reduce the numbers substantially.	0

You're welcome ! Now to continue to address your ignorance, which dovetails in with the staggering hypocrisy of most liberals. With Seneca the issue is far greater than mere power. Seneca is burning fuels that are normally burned in slash piles. By creating power with this fuels, which include the natural fuels building up on the forest floor causing fires to be hotter today, this is releasing far less smoke into the air than is currently done...and in a manner that is approved by the EPA. so, Seneca is polluting less than would be without this plant, and creating electricity from product that is normally burned to atmosphere creating nothing but smoke.

Boots, you're an idiot. For one, Trump didn't file bankruptcy...his corporation(s) did. Evidently, you don't understand that corporations are separate entities from their owners, and are governed by a board of directors...not by the owner(s). Filing bankruptcy is not against the law, nor is it considered unethical. If you think it is, then understand that Abraham Lincoln (who couldn't file BK because modern BK laws didn't exist yet), Henry Ford, Walt Disney, Milton Hershey, Burt Reynolds, H.J. Heinz, and PT Barnum also didn't pay back their creditors. But you're so much of a fool, that all you can do is repeat other people's lame rhetoric. Those who invested in Trump's businesses did so with the full awareness that there is a risk involved...yet, they invested anyways because there was also the potential for good returns. That's the chance THEY took. But then again, you come across as a fool so I don't expect you to understand how business and, in particular, investing works.	1

We do trust the police to do their jobs. We don't trust that there will be an adequate number of them to handle what's going to happen once a county-wide low-barrier shelter opens in a very bad location. The BPD's internal documents, uncovered via FOIA request, show crime has been a problem associated with the existing low-barrier shelter. Wilburton neighborhood supports moving the shelter to Eastgate because the Wilburton neighborhood is experiencing problems with shelter clientele. Auto dealerships stopped reporting car prowls because they happened so frequently when located near the shelter that BPD said there was nothing they could do. Those dealerships that moved to Eastgate had car prowls drop to almost nothing, but they're worried what will happen once they have a shelter nearby again. Bellevue College stands to gain from the rezone that will allow the shelter. It's called expansion of their campus. A small group of naive, idealistic students do not represent all students.	0
They haven't cut their per diems, megaprojects, gas line executives or marketing offices. They wouldn't even cut their subsidized food when they already have per diem and office supply slush fund to pay fo whatever they want. Just because we give them more money doesn't mean their priorities change. They will take our money and still screw the public over in favor of spending on whatever they want. Last year they just had to cut education by another 13 million at the last minute to 'save the budget' then spent it all on a new LIO for themselves. They are corrupt greedy arrogant bastards and that won't change if we give them more money, it will only empower them to take more.	1

You didn't hurt my feelings. Why would you assume you did? I enjoyed pointing out how Obama not attending the funeral is an example of the dumb attacks rampant in the GOP these days.	1
I totally agree. My point was even if the middle class did receive a tax cut, it would come from printing money. And to think the GOP complained about President Obama's stimulation package when the economy was on the verge of collapse. Sheesh.	0
"""Now when anything like this happens to them, it is treated like an attack on everything good and decent. But does it play with Trump's base? You know the answer to that. It plays as well as his attacks on the news media (when Dickerson asked Trump what he's learned so far, the first thing out of his mouth was how dishonest the media is), his continued prosecution of the Obama presidency and the Hillary Clinton campaign. He's still running against them, and against the media. It worked for him once — he clearly thinks it will again. One hundred days in, he's already looking a thousand days down the road."" Trump, everyone who voted for him and the entire the GOP are the most appalling liars and outright hypocrites this country has ever had the misfortune to endure. It is one of this country's greatest shames that Trump has been allowed to soil the White House. He is the most blatantly corrupt, unfit president we have ever had, as are the people who support him.

"1980 is ancient history. The political world has turned upside-down since then. The ""solid South"" is still solid, but it's solidly Republican. There are no Dixiecrats any more. The KKK voted for Trump, not Clinton. Reagan may have won college students in the South, but he also won a majority of non-college white votes with his wink-and-a-nod to Jim Crow, his dog-whistles to segregationists. Carter was a favorite son from Georgia. Add to that that the elderly were clinging to their Dixiecrat past. Clinton did well in the South, too, as an Arkansas native and state governor. The left doesn't say the Swedes killed the Jews during the holocaust, in fact history says the Swedes did a lot to rescue Jews from the ovens. The German state killed ix million Jews. If the Jews killed a few NAZI's, can you blame them? Where do you get this remarkably distorted view of history, Agirl? How about revealing your sources?"	0

Remy's remark reminds me of the ugly American with whom I went ashore in Japan while in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam war. The taxi driver did not understand the red neck's directions.

Bottom line: I never went ashore with that ignorant bigot again.	1
So ridiculous. Dense development around the stations makes transit more efficient and useful. We need tall condos and apartments right next to all of our light rail stations.

Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon. We need to remove him from the office, get him out of office now.	1

Actually, the main result for me of that year's Democratic Party's actions and Convention resulted in me voting against them and for Nixon. It also instilled a deep distrust of any politician of any party, further added to by Watergate, the Nixon Tapes, later revelations about LBJ and McNamara and Kissinger. Their successors have added little positive to acknowledge. The Clintons and the Bushes are just the most recent of a bad lot. I assume all politicians above the level of city dogcatcher are egotistic liars, cheats, and scoundrels when on their best behavior. When I discover a positive aspect to one of them above that level, I immediately check to see who their 'spin doctor' is. They are quite easy to locate.

Why do you think that? BC's carbon tax seems to have worked to reduce emissions and without a cost to the economy. We have a working example of an effective carbon tax right here in Canada. You may disagree with a carbon tax, and I can respect that. But when you call it stupid, you are only showing your own ignorance. Its not stupid to try a plan that has worked before.	1
"I watched the entire Trump speech and did some fact checking in the process. Trump has been called a Nationalist rather than a true Republican, and I think that is a more accurate depiction. Nationalism is very dangerous. It helped start WWI. My observations that don't necessarily indict the whole candidate. He said get out and vote, ""not this Tuesday, but next"". Nothing about mailing in your ballots. Claimed his Alabama rally was 35,000, originally said it was 30,000 in Alabama, then 32,000. Authorities put it at 15,000 (still a big number). Said he has 30,000 attendees at the W. Virginia rally. Authorities said 12,000. Exaggerating numbers is a salesman thing. He continually mispronounce Oregon. Didn't notice one person dared to correct him. Sanders did the same thing in Portland, was corrected, smiled and didn't mispronounce after that. His supporters so much want to ""make America"" (meaning their pride) great again. What will they do if Trump loses big time?"	0
"""We cannot have a Catholic Church without sacraments, and a priest is needed for the Eucharist, confession, and anointing"". I like to rephrase it ""We cannot have a Catholic Church without pureness of spirit, period."" Without the pureness of spirit, by clergy sexually abusing children and bishops hide and condone rapist clergies it is a place of Catholic hell instead. ""While I do think many who have drifted away simply ""couldn't give a fig"" about any of it anymore and are distracted by what the secular world has to offer"" That is a dishonest statement. I personally could not remain in the church smelling the stench of clergies sexual impurities, Archbishops shameless lying in public, their attitude of couldn't careless silence of clergy sexually abused children's suffering. What exactly is the purpose of the Eucharist, confession and anointing while those clergies rape children in confessionals? Our spiritual journey is a journey of purity of our heart, RIGHT?"	0
Too funny that the G&M mods would censor this quotation repeatedly.... “The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.” ― John Stuart Mill, On Liberty No bias among the commenters here, eh ?

I remember something under the (Democrat) president Lyndon Baines Johnson called the Viet Nam war, that was far more destructive in lives and treasure than our Iraqi adventure (and speaking as one who had more than one young relative return from the latter theatre as a wounded veteran). Democrat president Jimmy Carter also experienced something called the ""Iranian hostage crisis"" for >440 days - also quite a debacle, one would think. :-/ In Iraq, our military took over the whole country with far fewer casualties than the number who succumbed to HIV back home in the civilian population - and Saddam Hussein and his cronies were longer a regional problem. (Sounds like a win on at least one level.) It certainly is too bad that the Iraqi people lost the chance to reform their nation into a functional, pluralistic democracy - but then again, we're currently having some difficulties with that ourselves ... :("	0

The management of this inquiry is inept! They're putting out excuses and blaming third parties for what is specifically their responsibility. They're burning through money, which not stated in this article, the inquiry has spent a third of their budget, on what? There exists off the shelf software to search through court transcripts, what the hell do they mean it's not yet in place? This is a national inquiry, you don't need permanent office space, phone lines and computers. Hire mobile staff, give them cell phones and laptops. All data should be uploaded to the cloud or to a sharing platform like Dropbox. Just stick to the facts and statistics first, what percentage of women were murdered versus how many have strictly gone missing. Then get feedback from families on those 2 categories, testimony berating the police as racist is completely irrelevant! This inquiry is an expensive boondoggle, which in the end won't address the reasons why these women were murdered or went missing!	0

The geography of Iran makes it very difficult to launch a land war against it. You can't attack it from Iraq nor Pakistan, they simply won't allow it. Attacking it from Afghan brings a huge logistic problem, and you need Pakistan support (almost impossible). But without land war it will be meaningless to fight Iran, since they can produce quite a few weapons that can do big damages and lock up the whole gulf region. A prolong fight without land war is simply not acceptable. Also the gulf geographic condition is extremely unfavorable for US navy to wage a war against Iran. The gulf is totally exposed to Iran fire power along Iranian shore but provides no depth to American navy. And it is a huge logistic problem for US navy operate within the gulf during the war, probably they have to withdraw to somewhere outside it. But then you lose the launching place to attack Iran land. Overall you can't imagine American can start a war against Iran, Trump or not. It is a military nightmare.	0
On the other hand, every Muslim MP voted in favor of same-sex marriage in Germany recently. Actually, do you have a source for 48% believe homosexuality should be illegal and punishable by death? I see a recent poll that says 52% believe it should be illegal, but no mention of death. I wonder how US evangelical Protestants would answer that poll, given that a recent poll showed increasing acceptance of gays, ticking up to 36% saying gays should be accepted by society. I would hope that a minority of the non-accepters would push for it to be illegal.	1

Disruption is needed at all levels. Though these institutions have great intentions, nothing built-up unsustainably is designed to survive. As a country we need to figure out where our values are at like wise with our state. The cultural of creativity has been stifled by gate keepers of all types for long enough. Everyone was born with the potential to create. Focus on providing value and being of use instead of seeking to be adored and propped up.

So sick of the uniformed commenting about something they know nothing about. Of course almost all homeless people do not choose to be homeless. I finally left Anchorage for lots of reasons, two of them are Brother Francis Shelter is an abusive cluster and I realized Mayor Berkowitz and Nancy Burke were lying. They have now demonstrated what I tried to explain to people, it is all BS, propaganda, they have nothing. The goal was to remove the homeless from downtown while wearing the mask of altruism. There is no housing. I am in another state now and BFS/Berkowitz's admin were not the only reason I left, they had people following me around just before and during the Arctic Conference trying to provoke me. That was after months of surveillance on my blog which is documented. Why? I have not one clue other than I tell the truth. This same scenario of homeless lies and abuse while pretending to help is being played out all over the country directed by the feds. It's heartbreaking abuse.	0

Mentor your current candidates. Stop cannibalizing them and driving them from your party. If they got elected here, SUPPORT them. Clearly, they are serving their demographic and doing something right if they were able to get the votes in their district.

It's because their OWN party leadership won't look after them. After that, start recruiting new candidates and mentoring them. The leadership needs to think outside the box. Let the candidates have more control over their platforms. Let them stray away form the national platform if need be. But provide mentorship!! Develop leaders!	0

Because then they'd have to admit they've been had, suckered not just by Trump but by their own party for decades. And their egos can't handle that.	1
You have quite a talent if you can read minds, including Clinton's. In 1998, Clinton sent cruise missiles to hit a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan. I raised hell about it at the time. It was a terrible mistake. My wife and I were in a small room with him in late March, 1999, when Clinton announced to the public he was giving the NATO commander the go ahead to go into Yugoslavia. I was opposed to that, because it violated the U.N. Charter, but in fact I was wrong. If I recall correctly, we lost one GI and the bombing stopped the genocide of Albanians in Kosovo. My friend whom Clinton sent to Rwanda told me the problems there had been greatly exacerbated historically by the Belgians. The ten Belgian UN peacekeepers who were killed had zero relation to Clinton's policy or repercussions from Black Hawk Down six months earlier. It happened when the Rwandan president's plane was shot down and they tried to protect his successor. Clinton didn't bomb Afghanistan. You're making both up.	0

I came to Casper from Palm Beach, Florida for this event. Enjoyed every minute, hours of beautiful scenery. The drive from Laramie, thru Medicine Bow and on up to Casper was without traffic, in fact few cars and no trucks. The ride back was a long convoy as far as the eye could see and took 9 hours, which was time for closely exploring the vistas, shrubbery and animals. Stopping off at the 1909 Virginian Hotel was a treat with friendly folks serving the thirsty travelers. All total I traveled 4400 miles for two wondrous minutes and enjoyed myself and so to all the folks I met along the way, thanks for making my trek a great adventure.	0

As I pointed out to someone else--CSU also had two possessions into CU territory without coming away with points (and that was just going through the possessions on ESPN's play-by-play). One was right before half, when they committed a false start penalty and gave up two sacks on back-to-back plays. The other was their first drive of the 3rd quarter, when CSU responded to the OPI (after which they will still in CU territory) by committing a personal foul 2 plays later, and then throwing an INT right after that. You're also ignoring that CSU's last 2 possessions ended in turnovers....one of which was an end zone INT. The other was a long completion into CU territory which was then fumbled. 4 trips into CU territory without points. How about the CU TD drive of 94 yards on 6 plays (helped by a CSU roughing the passer). Was that the refs fault as well? None of this even gets into the dozens of other mistakes that will be seen on film that impacted the game more than any ref's call.	0

Multiculturalism should not mean that we (the West) tolerate another culture's intolerance. If we do in fact support diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights , then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on the grounds of multicultural sensitivity.

They are the foundation of our way of life; of our civilization – a civilization that learned, slowly and painfully, not to burn heretics, but to honor them.	0

"""...she offers no empirical basis or evidence for her conclusions...regarding the Anglican church!"" Well, your opinion is not unprecedented. To each his own, especially in a post! You can read the whole article in ABC RELIGION AND ETHICS, 8 Nov. 2016. Woodhead does base her research on the 2015 British Election Study, which noted that less than a third of UK people identity as Anglican, whose average age is 54; that the Anglican population plunged from 44.5% in 1983 to 19% this past year. Other studies have noted that the 2000 pre-Reformation Churches in England have fewer than 10 worshippers, and 8,000 more can barely muster 20. Also, we have the warning of the former archbishop of Canterbury, G. Carey: the Church of England is ""a generation away from extinction."" So I don't think her conclusions have no basis at all; her study makes good use of the GOVERNMENT charts of decline. (Gov. charts do count since the Church of England is a state church, an arm of the government.)"	0

The carbon tax is a scam. You cannot reduce carbon emissions while bringing in millions of immigrants each year. This has helped fuel a massive increase in housing prices, which essentially robs Canadians of their disposable income, meaning we have no money to buy the more expensive electric cars. Furthermore, sky high electricity rates mean everyone is heating with gas or oil. If electricity rates were dirt cheap as was the goal 50 years ago, we could all use electricity to heat = no carbon emissions. In short, the governments policies are stupid and poorly thought out, and contradict their goals, no wonder they aren't getting anywhere.	0

Let us see here. If the ridiculously frightening US forced 'us' to accept the conditions of the trade pact the author proposes, where tariffs would be imposed by the US administration unilaterally on the goods and services imported to the US from countries with which the US has a trade deficit, it would most certainly affect the 'free floating' nature of the American currency, given intrinsic American monetary independence, by introducing greater volatility to the US exchange rates against foreign currencies. This would, in turn, reduce the attractiveness of the US currency as an international reserve currency; repatriating US dollars. As China's Renminbi is pegged to the US currency, it is a solid substitute for the Yankee Doodle Dandy greenback. Unfortunately, the Euro would not likely be able to compete for the same title, although it would remain the reserve currency of choice for those nations trading with the EU.	0

Just because there are a lot of bad stories about someone in politics that you support doesn't mean they aren't true, right? How about some critical thinking skills? I am sure a lot of people that comment here have shared a meme or story that had absolutely zero truth to it. You have become the source of news you hate! Biased and nonfactual.	1

We have progressive taxation for good reasons, LFS, one being so that even working poor can have health care, food, housing and education even though they can't pay for it themselves. Compared to abject poverty (which we have in some degree), those subsidies make our nation a better, stronger, wealthier society. So let's take a look at ratio of disposable income, the money that runs our consumer economy, to net income. Working poor have little of either, and that ratio approaches zero. Their savings also approach or are less than zero. Those with incomes over $200K have a great deal of discretionary income, a lot of which can be put into saving and investments. Those people are the ones who can pay taxes, and they should. They take the most from our society in material riches, and so they should spend accordingly on the society that has made their wealth possible and safe.	0

Maybe you don't remember just a year ago when the Access Hollywood tape was released and about a dozen women came out with allegations of groping/assault by tRump. He's been outed as a sexual deviant and harasser, too. He was also good friends with Weinstein. By occupying the WH, tRump the Groper in Chief pretty much disqualifies all conservative gloating against the Clintons and Weinstein. You can't support tRump and still have any moral authority left over to try and spin this around to HRC and Bill, or any other liberals.	1

A CNN poll of Americans who watched President Donald Trump’s first address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening showed that nearly four out of five had a “positive reaction” to the speech. But not the Globe, yes the continued denial of a legitimate President who was brought to power through a democratic process truly illustrates Trump point of a bias media. A new chapter of American greatness beginning, Trump renewed the American spirit and layered out his accomplishments in a sensational address to nation. Although one was saddened to see the Democrats in white like cult uniforms sit on their hands through out and storm out as Trump received a standing ovation at the end of his address.

"I am not saying that adultery, rape and incest are acceptable and you know it. You are using the logical fallacy of the Straw Man. Fallacious arguments in actual debate is taken as saying ""I don't have an actual argument"". I am saying that a lot of the hooey that the Catholic Church teaches is tripe.A specific example is in JPII's Theology of the Body, 24. After citing Matthew 5:28, ""everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart"", he writes Christ did not stress that it is ""another man's wife,"" or a woman who is not his wife, but generically, ""a woman"" ... Even if [a man] looked at this way at the woman who is his wife, he could likewise commit adultery in his heart. (Theology of the Body, chapter 24.4) That a man can commit adultery with his own wife is ridiculous. Yet this is presented as a serious teaching. Don't even get me started on that odorous pile which is Humanae Vitae."	1

"Wrong! The Trump plan is a return to commonsense economics. It's a plan that will help the average person and boost economic growth for everyone's benefit. The only ""voodoo economics"" is from the neoliberal globalist elites and their ""free trade"" deals. The elites have destroyed millions of jobs, incomes and communities with their NAFTA and their ""World Trade Association"". And they wanted to destroy millions more jobs with their TPP until Trump stopped them. When the elites sold their vile NAFTA, they told us that we'll lose the factory jobs but we'll get better higher paying jobs. All we got in exchange was working for minimum wage at Tim Horton's or driving for Uber. The elites lie. They lie all the time about everything. Trump is only one who tells the truth. Trump's plan is a great plan."	0
"It's not so confined. However, the comparison between public and for-profit facilities, where poorly screened and poorly trained employees facing home foreclosures and car repossessions can get $100 or more for a pack of cigarettes, is key. Once they're compromised, the inmates own them. Other indicators of malfeasance and incompetence are educative. The for-profits have 50x as many escapes from transports, and 20x as many, per prisoner, from secure facilities. Riots are regular as rain and guards typically run away when they break out. GEO Group owns the ex-Bill Weimar (""alleged"" pedophile and briber) halfway houses in Alaska. They regularly get caught illegally underpaying their employees and bilking taxpayers while their CEOs and board presidents are making over $1 million a month.

It used to be a fed/state/city job meant less pay than you could get in private sector, but you got good benefits and had more job security.

"Political motivations, and parties aside. I would love to know peoples actual thoughts on this. Good. Bad? Could we actually get bipartisan support or is it a pipe dream. Additionally, the idea of a high speed transit in the windsor to toronto, and maybe in the future toronto to montreal corridors (which is like half of Canada's population) is one that may be interesting. There isn't much debate that infrastructure like this can massively foster growth along the route, but there is also the price factor. People don't like it in their backyard. Also, since this will be costly regardless, I would be curious price comparisons between HSR and Maglev. Mostly because the latter is more expensive but will require reduced maintenance costs whilst also having the advantage of being far quieter, likely reducing ""NIMBY"" BS. Not to mention it would be a great selling point of ""hey, look at our futuresque shit that travels at speeds that rival planes""."	1

Sater and Tevfik Arif, a Kazakh banker who worked in the Soviet Union, collaborated with Trump through their real estate company Bayrock to find buyers for the hotels and condos branded with the Trump name. Sater also visited Moscow with Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr. in the mid-2000s to scout a site for a Trump Tower there, a project that never came to fruition. Earlier this year, Sater played a role in helping put together a “peace plan” drawn up by a member of Ukraine’s parliament. That plan, which called for lifting U.S. sanctions against Russia, was reportedly hand-delivered to the White House by Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.	0

I do not believe that the ADUs being built in Kailua will house houseless from Kakaako Park. No, these ADU's will receive exorbitant rents from under the table B&B type operations, or the extremely excessive rents from the DOD housing off-base subsidies. Local people who need housing cannot afford this stuff, no way. And if you don't have a car, getting to a job in Waikiki or Kapolei on the bus from windward sucks. If, and only if, the City clamps down real hard on the B&B business, and the State legislates a truly honest and transparent method of assessing and collecting GET, property tax, income tax, and the transient accommodation tax, from all these undercover rentals will I give my blessing to these.

Canadian Culture is being open and accepting. It is being open and honest and not excluding others. It is not being held down by the confines of the past but looking to to the future. Calling a penis a penis and not playing some games that are just based on religious stupidity. Everyone should get the same education and not have to compromise based on who they attend school with. Coming to our country should mean conforming to our education and social systems. Religion is one thing but forcing values on others is not assimilating. I am not clear why we condone practices that are sexist and racist just because they are traditional. They would be not be accepted from Christians, so why is ok for Muslims. The whole system is absolute hypocrisy.	1

Anyone who has observed the past several years would know that this additional tax will not be enough. This project has been a classic slow-roll of endless cost increases, with many that could/should have been expected. It may already be too late to pull the plug but spending another few $B will surely reach that point of no return. IMO, a rail system will only work if additional lines are added to make it truly convenient and an alternative to driving. That would require spending probably another $50B+ and I don't know where that kind of money would come from. If it ends up being a single line from Kapolei to Ala Moana it does nothing other than become a monument to government waste and probably a tourist/recreational ride.	0
"As someone who has worked in numerous Islamic countries and post-conflict communities around the world, I know firsthand how much other cultures and religions (including Islam) add to our own richness. I therefore reject anyone who supports the travel ban on Muslims and falsely claims this act will make our country safer. To the contrary, all so-called ""terrorist"" attacks since 9/11 have been perpetuated by American residents and citizens, while none of the seven countries targeted has been the source of an attack on U.S. soil. Meanwhile, other Muslim-dominant countries where I've worked remain open, such as Saudi Arabia, Comoros Islands, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan. This religious ban will negatively impact international visits to the US, and create barriers for American travelers unafraid of other people and places (as you clearly are). In response, our country and the world deserve real leadership - not the greed, lies, and partisanshit you support."	0

I said this during the campaign and I'll keep fighting the good fight now that the Human Cheeto is president. Be careful with Hitler references. Unless and until Trump starts executing undesirables, all that calling him Hitler will do is get you started in massive arguments about who Hitler really was, and get you accused of Godwinning. But you wouldn't be too far off the mark to accuse him of being a new Mussolini. Still, you have a really good point. When a bunch of kids have to listen to an inept fool prattle on about how unfair the world is to him? Things are wrong there....	0

"You must admit that in the face of income tax vs. a PFD moratorium it really is the PFD that should go. Rich, poor, rural or urban, everyone shares in that ""donation"" the state government coffers, and on top of that, it is going to curtail all of the freeloaders that seem to believe that moving to AK is financially prudent given the ""free"" thousand dollars we get each year henceforth. Getting rid of the PFD will be a win-win for the entire state financially and will curb the carpetbagger influx."	0

Whether I do or don't isn't the question my good man. You see what's a DEAL to some folks isn't a DEAL to others. But that fact remains that the Globes readers aren't all people looking to shell out a maximum of $12,000 for a car. The point is that just because a story gets written about 50 or 60 thousand dollar cars doesn't mean that there aren't interested readers. Those may be DEALS for people looking at that market. Do you think the Globe should just write about cheap cars because some reader can't afford one?	0

The elimination of flow through shares will result in less taxation because now less new fields will be found. Therefore less economic activity will occur meaning less taxes and no royalty income from these new discoveries. What flow through shares do is allow producers to raise capital to drill these speculative wells. The well gets drilled and if it is successful adjacent wells are now developmental. A new mini multiplier effect is created with taxation occurring on all the activity in the form of GST, payroll taxes, service company taxes etc not to mention royalty payments. The flow through share in the hands of the investor allows that investor to deduct the amount from their annual revenue. The investor gets tax relief however the investor provides the capital that allows the small producer to take the chance on this risky and often unsuccessful target. What will happen now? These wells won't get drilled. There will be no tax savings but a net loss.	0

Most Trump voters remind me of the folks that made livings selling horses to the Army. They hated the invention of cars and trucks. They hated the 20th century as much as Trump voters hate the 21st century. Some want to dig coal for a living, but no one needs coal in the 21st century. Many want lost jobs, but most of those jobs are done by robots in the 21st century. I would pity them if they didn't think their problems would be solved by killing minorities. Will Trump pardon Dylan Roof? I'm sure his voters wouldn't mind. Many would be pleased. Most of them care much more about being white than being human or American. Too bad most of them will never learn to speak Russian. Learning new things is not their strength. In fact, they tend to fear change, new things, and new ideas in general. They are still going to be losers.	1

In another incident in 2010, she said her son smacked her in the head and locked her in the bathroom after she told him to stop playing video games. There was no indication in the records that he was arrested. Cont.............	0

"No both build on our nature. Here's a better understanding/explanation for you. God can (and wants to) use our nature to help us to get closer to Him. The human virtues are ""strengths"", capabilities that through the grace of God and our repetitive cooperation we can build to allow us to love more. Virtues are habits of doing good acts. Enduring dispositions but which can become derailed. Patience, prudence, cheerfulness (it's a strength too), industriousness, temperance, courage, fortitude...etc. Without these ""tempering strengths"" we can often ""give in"" to our nature which was injured by Original sin. We lost our perfect dominion of our attentive and appetitive faculties. That's why we need God. And God allows us the dignity of growing in virtue. Virtues oppose vices (in fact particular virtues oppose particular vices). Virtues are in the middle of one or more of opposing vices. Courage is ""in the middle"" of pusillanimity and recklessness (two vices). Etc."	0
"""All minorities and 'special rights' people are 'victims'."" was my statement.

""In grammar, a conjunction (abbreviated CONJ or CNJ) is a part of speech that connects words, phrases, or clauses that are called the conjuncts of the conjoining construction."" Correlative conjunctions work in pairs to join words and groups of words of equal weight in a sentence.

Lane County for Bernie Sanders has been active in the community for almost a year. The UO for Bernie and LCC for Bernie groups arose last fall spearheaded by students that started with LCFBS. We have had over 40 weekly meetings (most at Cozmic Productions) until the owners of the former church building lent us the use of the building. When official campaign staffers came to town last week, they gave it their blessing as the first official campaign office in Oregon. The owners of the building sold the pews. The campaign had nothing to do with that. We have definitely appreciated the hospitality of Theo's Coffee and Cozmic Productions over the many months we held our Saturday meetings and phone bank events there.	0

From my perspective these 'Neo Nazis' who in reality are 'want a b's' that call or refer to themselves as Nazis are neither German Party Nazis or Americans. Simply these Neo-Nazis are racist thugs. However, there is a bigger picture that now exist in a 'New McCarthyism' perpetuated by leftist in an attempt to justify their own hatred, even racial hatred, and their criminal activities generally associated with their own twist of anarchy. But again, they too are thugs. The first problem is [as said before] you can't mud-wrestle with a pig[s]. You will end up getting muddy and dirty as the pig likes it far more than you. Which brings me to my second point. Nearly all these letters, opinions on the Charlottesville, matter are at the very least uninformed. Some are dishonest, worse yet is the alarming yet unknown measurement of unethical immoral and intellectual dishonesty that the leftist demagogues love to practice.	1
Lisa lost my vote when she continually refused to buck her party on their refusal to allow a vote on the president's Supreme Court nominee, thereby rendering our wheels of justice useless and broken. Now she refuses to attend a debate to answer questions. That's chicken-**it. This move also smacks of John Tracy, whose firm serves as media consultants for Lisa's campaign. Tracy's a former KTUU manager/reporter and was a founding partner of GCI Ron Duncan's KTVA, which is KTUU's competitor. Ron Duncan is the man who funds and underwrites the bully tactics, couched as lobbying, in the halls of our capitol in Juneau to rob Alaskans of their fair share of PFD's and to restructure the Permanent Fund. He even got Bill Walker's AG to chime in and send the FCC a complaint letter in support of KTVA and against KTUU in a failed attempt to gut KTUU's business decisions. Now, Lisa's all in with Tracy's pettiness and resentments towards KTUU as he sullies, tarnishes and soils our politics.	0

The Anglo culture and the French cultures were *relatively* homogeneous, the French much more so than the English. And yes, MOST countries on earth are *relatively* mono- cultural.	0
Please refer to that graph link I posted, which is where I'm talking from. The 1940's and 1950's was an America united against a common enemy: Germany and then the USSR. Didn't you notice a brief unity just after 9/11, up until Bush went into Iraq? Maybe we should attack Russia and have us a formidable war to unite us again....lol.... Point is that an outside pressure put Americans in line. Left to their own, Americans are the violent people we see from 1900 until WWII, then again from the late 1970's until now. Also, note the sharp drop off in the early 90's. Wasn't there some kind of tightening of gun laws in that time? Asking the question...not making a point. The only thing I'd do regarding gun laws is require every single owner to have been trained and certified to use a gun, with annual testing renewal requirements. No permit, automatic 20 year jail term. Might help with some of the accidental deaths, too. BTW, I own a RAS-47.	0

He isn’t good at anything a president has to do. From the simplest, like pretending to help out in flood relief, to the hardest: making the call when all alternatives are bad. He doesn’t know anything about the issues with which he must cope. Nor does this seem to bother him. He doesn’t care to learn. It’s not like he’s getting better at the job, or scrambling to fill gaps in his knowledge. He has no views about public policy. Just a few brute prejudices, like if Obama did it, it was dumb. I do not say he lacks beliefs — and his belief in white supremacy is one — but he has no positions. His political sky is blank. No stars to steer by. Nothing he says can be trusted. His “model” of leadership is the humiliation of others— and threat of same. No analyst unfamiliar with narcissistic personality types can hope to make sense of his actions in office.	1

This I so wrong on so many levels. Who gets to sanitize history? The answer is apparently a mob of politically correct vandals who can't view history in context. These people are a bubble off of the same collective mindset displayed by ISIS in tearing down ancient temples and statues. They assign meaning and claim injury to objects that have long ago lost any aura. These people can't separate the past from the present. They lack an ability to get past their self-absorption and see how this could apply, in the future, to statues erected today. These memorials are a part of our collective past. The reasons for their erection are as much a part of the past as the actions or people they depict and none of these reasons or actions happened in a vacuum. They took place as a time where norms were entirely different. These changes in our society are memorialized, in part, by how these events and people are viewed now, not by trying to erase them as if they never existed.	0

"I did see the slick ball comments over the weekend too, it is interesting but I just can't buy in to the juiced ball yet. ""Chicks dig the long ball"" but last night was a bit ridiculous, though fun. Yes, the homer that hit the train tracks was crazy. You're right, there was a record number of home runs hit during the regular season too. Kind of like the juiced ball theory from I think 1987 or something like that all over again. Tough to say. I think some of it has to be contributed to batters that are just in peak shape now too; it's a year-around game with the training regimens these guys adhere to. I think you mix that in with the new focus on launch angle and hitting the ball in the air consistently, the three true outcomes (HR,K,BB) and pitchers creating more force with the speed they're throwing it all adds up to more home runs. I'll be curious to see if more commentary from the players about the ball comes out after the series."	0

Not referencing any comment in particular, but why does it seem that with the Globe's new civil comment policy the level of discourse has become even more puerile and inane and the same obviously I-do-nothing-but-post-on-websites-18-hours-a-day commenters seem to have been given even greater prominence? Does the Globe ever look at perhaps the NYT to see how to present its product in an engaging way that encourages thoughtful comment, not predictable polemics? At least in the old days you had to actually find a soap box, drag it down to Hyde Park Corner and be prepared to publicly make a fool of yourself. And many very engaging people did just that and we're the better for it.	0
Watching Trump's rambling, deceitful, disrespectful, self- congratulatory speech at the CIA yesterday simply reinforces why this man is so completely unsuitable for the job. He seemed genuinely unhinged. Maybe he was tired after his big day but then maybe he doesn't have the stamina age 70 to be President.	0
10.5 millions!!!!!!!!!!!!! Has this government lost it's mind! This government will drive us to bankruptcy with their careless, irresponsible and entitlement attitude! We have thousands of hard working Canadians waiting for operations and treatment or who have died in service and they would certainly deserve the use of $10.5 million if anyone did! When is this going to stop... are we going to pay millions to all our former enemies?	1

"If a black man had paraded around with a weapon for weeks, surrounded by other heavily armed black men who vowed to NEVER leave a location until their demands were met. And if that same black man was stopped by law enforcement and told to turn off his car but instead ""gunned it"" and found himself facing a roadblock and instead of stopping, plowed into a snow bank and exited his truck yelling Shoot Me several dozen times, all while attempting to reach the gun in his jacket. YES, I would expect that person, whatever their color to be shot, and any officer of any color that shot him would be completely justified."	1
"WTF are you talking about? Obama started the KKK and other white supremacist groups? There is no ""alt-left"", either - the alt-right named ITSELF that, and it is strongly represented among white supremacist groups. These groups existed LONG before Obama, and the only thing Obama did to create this problem is have the temerity to be black and be President. Only someone blind to history would assert that racial violence started with Obama!"	1

I think that the Democrats need to find a strong progressive voice from the Rust Belt or the West. To go back to the establishment leaders from the East will not do them much good. Their message, from the Eastern progressives, has been diluted by the right wing noise machine. The leader must be chosen by the Rust Belt or Western populace. She/he should not be forced down people's throats. The progressives must also accept the new leader may not be totally progressive, but still will move to implement most progressive policies. The new leader must figure out a way to address abortion and gun rights in a way that current progressives and conservatives agree is workable. Governors Bullock (MT) and Hickenlooper (CO) Sherrod Brown (Sen OH) and James Webb (former Sen VA) could serve as examples. And the best service that the Clintons could now give to the country is to go into retirement. Saying little and being seen even less.	0
Exactly. It would take a fairly substantial swing for the Tories to win, especially a majority. But cutting the Liberals down to a minority that is much easier. In Ontario alone, there were over 20 ridings the Liberals won by narrow margins. Likewise there were 15 ridings in Ontario where the Tories got over 40% but still lost meaning stronger splits could flip them back. The results in Ontario were 45% Liberals, 35% Tories so if it was say 42% Liberals and 38% Tories that would cost the Liberals 20 seats meaning only big gains in Quebec could save their majority. Likewise in BC, the pipeline and electoral reform broken promise hurt Trudeau so could mean more NDP seats there or perhaps strong enough splits to allow a few more Tories to come up the middle.	0

A balanced budget does not mean tapping our state savings account to pay what you are unwilling to cut."" Thanks again East Anchorage."	1
Well , maybe it is time for people like you to panic, Michael! Who on earth are you to criticize? Bush’s speechwriter? Why didn’t a sane person like Bush deal with the North Korean threat?

Don't be a buzz kill for most posters here, Bradley. Yes, David Johnston was appointed by PM Harper and he was the best GG since the days of Georges Vanier appointed by Diefenbaker, Roland Michener appointed by Pearson and Jules Leger appointed by Trudeau 1.0. In the 31 years between Leger and Johnston, we had too many less distinguished and accomplished GGs mainly with ties to the party in power at the time and with a political and/or media background. A man of truly impressive talents and accomplishments, David Johnston restored prestige to what was once an office occupied by Canadians of the highest achievement. It seems entirely possible Trudeau 2.0's appointment Julie Payette will prove to be a good one more in the Vanier-Michener-Johnston tradition than the Romeo LeBlanc-Jeanne Suave-Ray Hnatyshyn tradition. It is to hope. Thank you, David Johnston, for your example and dedication during seven sometimes turbulent years. We could be proud of you and so too of our country.	0

"Your ""you can't even give us an exact date for St Cyril's birth"" is simply you being ignorant. Putting a question mark after someone's birth or death date simply says that the date is unknown. It should not surprise anyone that birth records from 4th century Egypt don't exist. Cyril's life and character are both well known. As a young man, he participated in the railroading of John Chyrsostom, to distract people from charges of fiscal mismanagement by his uncle Theophilus. He deliberately misstated the views of Nestorius, and did not give Nestorius a proper chance to defend himself at Ephesus (and excluded John of Antioch for coming a day late to the council). He expelled the Jews from Alexandria. He incited the mob who lynched Hypatia, the head of the Neo-Platonist school. All of these are well known to anyone who has studied Church history."	1
It does not matter what Trump thinks of Ryan, it matters what the Republican Voters think, & Ryan is being primaried by the base next year, The Republican party is grossly out of touch, but we will make believers out of them again, just as we did during the Presidential primaries. Not even Trump can save people like Ryan, Strange (or anyone else endorsed by McConnell) Flake etc. Corker is gone as well. Trump is the only elected official in American with a national mandate,and when the Republican party bucks him, including on the wall, they are bucking the Republican voters, not Trump. Well, in 2018 we will get rid of all of our insubordinate, arrogant employees up for re-election. Indeed, we will even vote 4 challengers in the primaries who may have positions we don't support, because what someone campaigns on doesn't matter in the USA, we get the same garbage in both parties.

Good points by Lawrence Martin, but restricting the number of times a week the PM will show up to Question Period is far from the most pernicious part of the proposed Liberal changes to the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. A Canadian government, particularly a majority government already has awesome powers.

There are few enough as it is.	0
The fact is, WWI was caused by britain. germany was a far superior nation military-wise and industry wise. It wanted part of the empire cake, and britain wouldnt share. George V, Kaiser Wilhelm and Tzar Nicolas were 1st cousins, all grandsons of victoria, constantly writing to one another, visiting, comparing, being jealous... this squabbling led straight to WWI dragging 10s of millions of innocents to horrible suffering and death, sucking Canada into the greedy violent sphere. What a pathetic lie it is to think that we gloriously defended canada and britain. We were used; period. Things might have been different if victoria didnt hate children so much.

Of course you don't need $104,000 to take advantage of a TFSA, but if you've only got $10,000 saved up and you need to keep it in savings because it's your emergency fund then you're not getting anywhere near the benefit of someone with $104,000 fully invested. And that's the point, a lot of our tax breaks dis-proportionally benefit those with higher net worth. How much benefit did you get from the 50% capital gains inclusion rate, or the dividend tax credit? These are measurable effects. Whatever role racism plays in financial disadvantage is subjective and impossible to measure (or get rid of for that matter), whereas the specific and measurable advantages enjoyed by the wealthiest Canadians are largely ignored.	0

"""My own view is that Mr. Trump is the most alarming President in our lifetime. He is a petulant, vindictive and pathologically narcissistic demagogue. Will he be an unmitigated disaster?"" Short answer - yes. And it's not just because he's a narcistic twit - it's because of his nominees for various cabinet and advisory posts. Religious nutters (his nominee for AG has openly stated that secular individuals don't understand truth and shouldn't work for the government), the head of HUD refuses to answer questions about how he'll treat LGBT people, his VP has openly stated that he'd ensure that Roe v Wade will be repealed, and so forth."	1
I agree that Trump is amoral but I'm not so sure he's a moron. More and more, I think he's crazy like a fox with his uncanny political survival instincts and his uncanny ability to appeal at every turn to the lowest common denominator in society and then use it to his political advantage. There's a certain kind of genius at work there that is more demonic than moronic, I think, but maybe that's just me.	1

Yes, and good reason. Increased immigration has for decades now been used to stagnate wages, and in some cases depreciate them. We just learned that an additional 40,000 immigrants will be arriving next year, which gives us good reason to believe that wages wont be rising anytime soon as a result of inflation.	0

Trump, like his follioers, is ignorant in regard to how Presidents are elected in the U.S. I wish someone would teach them about the Electoral College and how it works.

He fled to the security of a federal job at the recommendation of a friend who, apparently, knew him pretty well.

Will he make the same speech for the China free trade deal? Did he consider the same review for TPP? One of the major considerations is that Canada exports raw materials which are not subject to tariffs (although the EU considered banning Oil Sands oil). most of its manufactured products are produced elsewhere. most times at a lower cost. As we cannot get pipelines to the coast built, much of our trade issues are self inflicted. So, in reality, what will this free trade agreement do for Canada other than reduce the cost of Mercedes and BMWs? What products other than some agricultural products will be shipped and will this just replace the same product shipped elsewhere? In other words, will this make much of a difference if there is an increase of billions in a trillion dollar economy or this really all about politics?	0
Some of us have been here so long we remember when Alaska was predominately Democrat. That was before we had any money, especially before we started giving away money.

These changes mean more non-union Canadian employees and Canadian families, are subsidizing companies and foreigners, the exact opposite of what we need to be doing to grow the economy. When you hear ""create jobs"" that's a misleading statement, there are jobs available, ( the job vacancy is 2% when it should be held at 3.5%+, by decreasing immigration and access to foreign labor) good current available jobs have to go to Canadian citizens, not fill those jobs with newcomers or foreigners because it's easier for companies, and then say subsequently jobs will be created. Stupid and a fraud on Canadians to say the least. Fail by Bains and the Liberals."	1

I know more about the energy business than you, apparently, and more about national security. Sorry but I don't want to sell coal or oil overseas to fuel the enemies of America.

AND because SK cannot (not to mention Japan) the US cannot accept it either. Also note we didn't accept Iran's nuclear program either. Appeasement was not and is not the method used by the US dealing with nations nuclearizing. Sorry, I didn't realize you were still focusing on the ""appeasement"" part.

To All, . I've penalized by Civil. I can only post twice in a 24 hour period. . According to their software, I’m guilty of “continued biased voting.” In other words I was not voting down comments “the right way.” What a bunch of nonsense. What some people might view as offensive was OK to me because there were no threats or personal insults. I’m a reasonable and rational 56-year-old man, but I won’t let an a computer censor me. . I think the problem with Civil is the ability of people to vote negatively toward a comment they merely disagree with. If you say something snide about Trump, his fans might claim you’re not being civil. If you say you like him, others might censor you because of that. . The Denver Post has saddled you with subjective punishment. Are you OK with that? I’m not. I’m going to “deposit” this twice a day to rub their noses in it, and I encourage you, the reader, into doing the same. Don’t let them force you into being a spineless clone. . Speak up.	0
Relieved the Globe didn't jump on the bandwagon of clapping Trump on the back for doing a 180 on his non regime change stance toward a mindless missile attack on the Syrian air base.

I have spent a half-hour reading up, and it seems the Bismarck crossing was ruled out before public comments by the Corps of Engineers based on their early EIS, which cited proximity to the Bismarck drinking water intake along with proximity to dwellings and number of road crossings.

In the Qur'an, Allah is known as the great trickster and the best liar. They are taught its righteous to deceive infidels. You, Paul, are an infidel. The whole point is to get in our good graces and then, at the right moment, when THEY are in power, either convert or kill us. After all, WE are infidels, worthy only of death.

Timothy Lopez, consider this, if Alaska had no oil workers Alaska would have no money to tax. No Alaskan has ever been able to find and sell oil for a profit. Fix this! Fix these laws and oil and gas agencies that keep Alaskans and smaller oil companies out of the oil and gas wealth. Now only majors can profit. Ask what the state legislature is doing to fix the fact only one exploration well has been drilled this year with 5 million acre under lease. The laws and rules make Alaska unattractive so that is why the Gulf of Mexico has almost 50 bidders and over $300 million show up in the lease sale this month, in DEEP WATERS. The North Slope sale only had one producer bid and no one bid last year in the Cook Inlet and no bidders in the Beaufort Sea in 2015, why Alaska is unfriendly and runs good investors out by blocking everyone and pricing the Alaskans and smaller companies out for many reasons. Why is Alaska so unattractive is it because of the oil haters or monopoly lovers?	0
Postol's report, as he stated himself if you read it, was based on Google maps and YouTube videos. He is a retired prof and didn't see any evidence firsthand. Also, his paper was published by Russia Today, a propaganda arm of the Kremlin, and then, obviously, duly reported by zerohedge, which is a tool - knowingly or not - for spreading Russian propaganda in the Western media. Here is an article from one of the witnesses at the recent Senate hearings into Russian meddling in the US election explaining how it works. https://warontherocks.com/2016/11/trolling-for-trump-how-russia-is-trying-to-destroy-our-democracy/ For example, the journey of propaganda may go like this: Putin > RT.com > zerohedge > Fox News > Trump fans > G&M comment section.	0
Informers in criminal matters never have their names revealed. Prosecutors will drop case if necessary. It is so informers or confidential sources continue to provide information and not get discouraged or killed. So here is the deal: 1) your article was to long and boring., 2) I felt like I was being scolded an talk down to, 3) I can and will join other chart forums, 4) your news organization is only as good as your ability to garner viewership (readership), 4) you need those that comment more than those that comment need you, 5) I like CB but I don't feel a need to comment unless I can do it under my own terms and finally, 6) I personally have been to your office, provided my biographical information on a story and felt very confident in dealing with your staff. After I left you made the call as you deemed appropriate. It's your paper and I was simply source material. I agree with Harpoon. Thanks and best regards. /s/ mark twain	0

This is the second time I know of where Trump has thrown his supporters/base/his voters under the bus. The first was trying to repeal Obamacare, a program most of his supporters depend on. In this one, he cuts all sorts of help that go directly to his voters, the poor whites who get food stamps, Medicaid, social security disability, social security cash for the poor, rental assistance, meals on wheels, all of it will disappear. His base and his voters will starve to death or get sick and die.	1

"Foreign investment = profits and jobs are moved overseas;. Canadian technology, often developed by public funds is acquired and sent out of the country. R & D work is often transferred to other countries. Foreign management makes decisions that are not in Canada's interest. Exports often cease so as not to compete with the parent company. A large amount of taxes to Canadian governments is lost through creative transfer pricing so that the profit appears to be earned in low tax jurisdictions. Bring back the Foreign Investment Review Agency - set up by Herb Grey and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau which reviewed foreign takeovers to determine if they were of significant benefit to Canada. Unfortunately, FIRA was replaced by the Tories with Investment Canada, which over the years has become a tiny rubber stamping rump of what FIRA was. Regrettably, Canada's current Prime Minister is an arrogant, ""trust fund baby"" who likes cavorting with foreign billionaires."	0

The house was in fine shape until it was torn down by an unethical businessman in hopes of rebuilding the house in the Haleakala National Park as a tourist destination. This venture failed and all that is left of Argonauta is the orange tile floor. I know this because I was living in the house up until the day that a rag tag crew showed up and started the tear down. The feature that distinguished the structure and which was its namesake, was the way the ocean facing wall projected the sound of the incessant crashing waves to a section of the front lawn - like a speaker dispensing soothing ocean sounds. Most nights I would sleep in a lawn chair in that particular spot enjoying a sleep so deep it would have made Sleeping Beauty envious.	0
Is natural climate change also a real and present danger to our planet? Just 60 years ago, climatologists were warning of the disaster of the next ice age, expected due to the relatively cyclic nature of the earth's natural climate change over the eons and the fact that the earth has been much cooler in the past 2 million years than at times before. Recent ice ages have been devastating to life on earth, accompanied by mass extinctions. The interspersed warming periods have seen abundant life develop. During the last ice age, there were glaciers into the middle of America. It was only after that last ice age ended 10,000 years ago that human beings flourished on the earth. Another natural occurring ice age would seem to be the real enemy to be avoided at all costs. Or is anything that man contributes to the environment by definition bad, and anything that nature does to us good, even if it results in mass exterminations? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period	0
Stupid reply. At least try to make it humorous if one cannot debate the facts. President Trump has a real good clue on what makes America great. He is busily fixing everything that undermined our great America. Trump has already signed 34 executive actions in his first 100 days--and those, one by one, are methodically removing the detrimental Obama Legacy that stopped America from being great.	1

You obviously have a dog in this fight and it is Hillary and even though Trump crossed a line and was a complete idiot, especially at the end of his speech. In your first sentence you start making your case with your opinion, but I beg to differ (I want to be fair so I will fight opinion with opinion), what he said was not even close to being as viscous, condescending and judgemental as what the Podesta emails revealed. Then you go on to state Clinton is wrong on abortion but....... There is no but, her stance and that of the DNC are wrong and it really is that simple.

They condemn revelation of inconvenient facts as merely the continued plotting of the Lügenpresse.

You may wonder, why would an employer match contributions rather than just pay the 3-6% into a dc fund, like they did 25 years ago? Because they get to keep whatever the employee can't/won't match. It's not a match for the employee - it's a penalty that allows employers to claw back pension contributions. Pay employees poorly enough, and as an employer, you'll not have to make any pension payments. Having said that, do whatever you can to match. If you stay away, you're just playing into their hands.	0

It's all they've got. Notice that whenever a Trump supporter is asked to defend anything Trump has said or done, they immediately start attacking Clinton and/or the left and Democrats.

His supporters know that, thus the never ending barrage of attacks on everything Democrat.	1

The khan family should also be upset with Clinton for supporting the Iraq war. Not hearing much on that front. We continue to maintain air strikes in that region for the Iraqi government we support to even have a chance in battle. If my son died in Iraq I would probably hate any politician that supports invading any country that isn't an immediate threat to ours. Trumps question did have some legitimacy. Some Muslim countries are beginning to treat their women better but we still know the majority of Muslim countries don't give their women the respect they deserve. The delivery of his statement wasn't the best, but the political uproar following turning an extremely sad situation of a young man losing his life into a battle to help get Clinton elected might be worse.	1

Did your instructor simply turn off your air? Or did he cut the air supply line and leave you there hoping you'd make it? We're you training in a pool or protected cove? My guess is that you were in ideal conditions to handle the situation. Do the pilots practice those landings in windy conditions that would close airports down, or do they wait till the weather is favorable. Are there not people standing by to assist the firefighters if the structure collapsed on trainees? I've trained in burning structures before and was pretty darn scared, I'll admit, but I knew that I wasn't going to die or be seriously injured because people were there to assist and respond as necessary. To know that factions of the public hold low regard for human life is appalling. Everyone on board the Destination and the El Faro died with their objective being to survive. To put others in those conditions (water is water right?) and tell them the objective is to gain experience is completely asinine.	1
'.....He has a gorgeous, New Age wife....' . . Uh, no...It took me a while to put my finger on it, but Trudeaus' wife is atttactive in the way I remember being in grade three and finding my treacher 'attractive'.

Once you mature, (you know-high school and beyond) you leave that behind, and move into more adult-type fixations... . Trudeaus wife is who she is, no beef with her. (Well there is the singing, and the servants) But 'gorgeous'? (Gorgeous=traffic stopping, guaranteed the best looking in any bar she could walk into anywhere, etc.).No. .

"No Jimbo, China, the EU and the USA are the biggest part of the problem. Canada produces less than 2% of global GHGs. We could cease to exist tomorrow and China alone would make up the difference in less than a year. And don't give me any nonsense about ""per capita emissions"". Anyone who quotes per capita emission numbers isn't interested in solving climate change. The atmosphere is a fixed unit so applying a metric with a variable that is not fixed (population) is just idiotic (although what do you expect from the mathematically illiterate global population). The planet doesn't care how many people live here. The only metric that matters is TOTAL EMISSIONS."	1
"You are quite correct of course, in how the heavy cuts in essential State functions and lack of action to raise new income has affected our LE and Justice systems BUT - Alaska [much of AST, our DAs, and our Courts] have always had an Extremely hard time treating sexual crimes against children and women as serious crimes.

That difference also existed from 1935 to 1985 and yet houses in the Vancouver region were fully affordable for local workers in that half-century period, so clearly something changed after 1985. By the way, autumns and winters in Vancouver are NOT particularly enjoyable, and I can say that having lived for years in all three provinces (BC, Alberta and Ontario). Clouds and rain and clouds and rain, weeks on end? I dunno, that puts quite a downer on the place, though I agree the springs and late summers there are lovely.	0

Losing private sector jobs in exchange for public sector (government) jobs to me is never a good thing.

@wiliki: You say that we should spend whatever money is necessary to fund the rail program, but you also say that we should fund adequate early education. The entire problem is the money they are spending on rail makes it impossible for the City or the State to have enough money left to spend for adequate early education. If we had spent $2 Billion of the money that we are now spending on rail, we could have easily provided enough money to fund adequate early education. Unfortunately that's not the case and will not be the case for the forseeable future.	0

While I agree this was a poor choice I don't think it should cost anyone their job. Finding people who enjoy working with kids and treat them kindly isn't easy. Reprimand both for their poor choice of words and the principals inability to look over it before it went out and file it as a normal employer does. Likely a first strike offense. You reprimand discipline and move on. This mistake didn't endanger anyone, it didn't affect any kids. It was a message sent to adults of an elementary school geez. They admitted fault, made a correction and are talking about ways to ensure it doesn't happen again. Angry mob of pro-marijuana folks asking for her job is ridiculous.	1

You can now buy “skimpier coverage” and pay less. When you incur a huge claim (like say a $300,000 heart surgery) not covered by your skimpy plan then you default on the balance, the hospital pays the claim for you and they build the cost of that loss into the rates that they charge people with real (non-skimpy) coverage and people on government funded plans like FEHB and Medicare. Therefore people who fail to buy adequate coverage rely on their neighbors to pay their freight. Get your fork off my plate! Isn’t this why we wanted universal coverage to begin with?

"It's always been popular to hate politicians, and the level of violence included in that hate rises and falls as fear grips the country. In 1919, 36 anarchist bombings shook the nation. New to the scene is the internet, which allows writings such as this and any other to quickly disseminate and stay ""live"" in the form of hate-filled websites that regurgitate lies and partial truths. Just as importantly, they are self-innoculated from criticism by identifying any source of contrary evidence as proof of a conspiracy to silence them. Attacks on them actually make them stronger. In some ways, the government conspiracy movement seems different now, as it takes on the mantle of true, Constitutionally inspired patriotism. Tea Party Patriots see themselves as speaking for the Framers, and carrying guns in the name of their 2nd Amendment rights. It's not a difficult leap from vilifying politicians to actual threats and actions against them, all in the name of ""freedom""."	0

(re: flooding streets) I was not exactly linking the two, but they are. Kamehameha Schools is the primary land owner in Kakaako.

"I'm so tired of the brazen lying of the right. I think it all starts with the lying. Lying on this scale demonstrates that they have no moral compass whatsoever, and are willing to say and do nearly anything to enact their radical and deeply un-American agenda. BTW, on these Civil Comments, I consider lying to be ""uncivil"", and vote that way. In fact, I agree with Sam Harris when it comes to lying in a Western-style democracy - someone who lies - especially one who does so much as today's Republicans - is doing one of the worst things you can do, short of violence. I don't really care about stuff other people consider ""uncivil"" (adult humor, etc.), but I DO consider lying to be one of the worst things, and I will definitely vote a comment that has clear lying in it - the GOP talking points are easy to spot as uncivil and do not feel the least bit guilty about it. In fact, I think that's how the Civil comments system could work best, by filtering out blatant lying from the right."	0

No. you are wrong. The legislation was passed in 1961 to assist Alberta. The Alberta price of oil was $3.00 while the Saudis delivered up the new St Lawrence Seaway to Chicago for $1.70, occasionally $1.50. The Americans lost interest in Alberta oil. (Sound familiar?) Two new pipelines were built to supply Canada as far east as Toronto and Montreal. One carried Alberta natural gas (north of Lake Superior) and the other (Enbridge, south of Lake Superior) carries crude oil. All of Canada west of the Ottawa river which includes Ontario were obligated to use Alberta petroleum. The Arab oil cartel artificially inflated the price of crude in the mid 70s, eventually to $30 from $3, and a world recession ensued. The substitute for the NOP, the new NEP, was intended to partially shield Canadians from the artificially inflated Arab cartel price. Alberta felt it was it's right to have the cartel equivalent from Canadians, and so today Ontario buys oil on the world market (St Lawrence Seaway).	0

Your purposeful misdirection is like saying the DP, posting a story where tomorrow's high temperature is to be 90 when it turns out to be only 89.

There are several reasons why violations of student rights are upheld by the courts. One of the most basic reasons is known as in loco parentis. This Latin phrase basically means that while a student is in the custody of a school, the school can and often should act as a parent. In this duty of the school, many decisions can be made that are outside the normal governmental purview. The other basic reason for violation of student rights has to do with the goal of school — to educate. If an act of a student can interfere with the educational process, that act may, in many cases, be suppressed.	0

Islam's impact was the most notable in the expansion of trade. The first contact of Muslims with India was the Arab attack on a nest of pirates near modern-day Mumbai to safeguard their trade in the Arabian Sea. Around the same time many Arabs settled at Indian ports, giving rise to small Muslim communities. The growth of these communities was not only due to conversion but also the fact that many Hindu kings of south India (such as those from Cholas) hired Muslims as mercenaries.[118]	0

I firmly believe that truly vile people like white supremacists/nazi/klan members, supporters, and enablers, have the right to 1st Amendment protections and the ACLU should always challenge governmental attempts to restrict those rights. Thus, the ACLU did the right thing in C'ville. There is only one group to blame for what happened in C'ville and that is the white supremacists/nazi/klan members. The 1st does not protect these racists from non-governmental consequences to their hate speech. There open aggression and violent rhetoric should always be called out, shamed, scorned, and derided by the real decent people who also have the same rights. The racists crossed the line from hate speech to violence but in so doing, the found out that supposed ""liberal snowflakes"" will fight back.

"Most white Americans don't know their true history. I'm glad you got a good education. However, the folks that just elected Trump don't know or believe that history. You need to own your lesser cousins that are the majority of white folks. You have some family work to do. Just like black parents have to give their children ""the talk"". The talk that explains that we don't have equal protection under the law and that they could be killed for no particular action they take. They must be always aware of their behavior in the presence of cops, from the point of view of cops that may think they are about to kill them. Unfortunately, being innocent until proven guilty is a white privilege most of the time. For that matter so is the 2nd Amendment. Every time a cop gets away with killing an unarmed black person, they claim they were in fear for their life. It does not matter that they were not actually in any danger."	1

This is an extremely complex situation with multiple interlocking issues of sectarian, tribal, political conflicts which are way beyond our understanding, let alone capacity to resolve.

But, we should also make sure that Canadians who personally decide to join the conflict will not be welcomed back in Canada.	0

Another laughable piece from Saunders. Anti-Semitism among native Europeans has never disappeared, although in the recent years it is mostly manifested by left's obsession with Israel and Zionists. But even with this endemic hostility, Jews were doing fine in Europe. The resurrection of anti-Semitism as direct existential threat coincided with massive increase in Muslims in Europe. Before that, old fashioned Antisemitism was relegated to cranks and their worst acts were desecrations of cemeteries or Holocaust denial. The Islamic variety on the other hand brought direct threat to personal security. And ISIS terror is not the only source.. Muslims are so hostile to the Jews, that public wearing of Jewish symbols is highly discouraged unless one wants to risk harassment and battery. If Saunders wants to find truth the simplest test would be to ask French Jews who came to Israel why they did it. I am sure that very few (if any) will list National Front as the reason.	0

No Allan, they're not protesting the treatment of black Americans. Colin Kaepernick was protesting the treatment of African-Americans last year. And none of those players was kneeling alongside Colin Kaepernick last year. Those owners linking arms with their players and mouthing off are the very same owners that have boycotted Colin Kaepernick from the NFL -- the hypocrisy is overwhelming. All these protests are about Trump's conduct. And that's not worth disrespecting your country. Trump's behaviour is great. Trump's supporters knew what they were getting when they voted him in, and he's delivering. Like I said, Trump's conduct is far better than the deceitful lies of Trudeau, Obama and Clinton.	1
LOL, who my kids marry is in great part a function of how they were raised. No, we don't know that male same-sex attraction is pre-determined; in fact the evidence points to the contrary and that it is associated with environment, oftentimes involving abuse as a child (which they might not remember). Fortunately, with Trump in office, a lot of the social liberalism is soon to be reversed, taken from our laws and removed from our schools. I know several parents who are distressed at how their kids have become sexually confused from what is being taught in school; this trans-bathroom nonsense is the straw that broke the camels back. Conservatism is back. Open homosexuality is a proven failure; I believe that open homosexuality (and its destructive force against society) is what led to the teachings in Genesis (Sodom & Gomorrah) and Leviticus.	1

There are great diversity among the approximately 1 billion Catholic. Catholic theology does evolve as we gain scientific knowledge and better understanding. The views on Mary Magdalene changed with more evidence. The condemnation of Galileo changed when confronted with scientific knowledge. The Middle East Crucades were found to not support the message of Jesus as well as the Churches treatment of slaves. The point is that with new knowledge the Church made corrections. The same is true with the biological determinism of homosexuality. The key is to have the courage to make doctrine adaptation when confronted with new knowledge and understanding. God gave us Pope Francis at a time when the church was losing its focus and needed to reassess its role and correct wrongs. Change is challenging particularly within the confines of a highly bureaucratic organization culture where power has been vested in a conservative groups. Join me in prayer for Pope Francis's success.	0

I want to add another point against the electoral college. If you are a left leaning environmentalist living in, let's say, Texas, or Louisiana, your vote doesn't count, because it's going to go to the Republican candidate. If you are a right leaning, pro mining, anti-regulation voter and live in, let's say, Oregon, or California, your vote doesn't count, because it's going to go to the Democratic candidate. How can ANYONE defend that? It's flat out wrong. Just another tool to keep control under the corporatocracy. In addition to abolishing the electoral college, let's make elections publicly funded only, the campaign season two months long, allow third party candidates in the debates, have truth in advertising, vote by mail so it's easy and convenient to vote even if you are a single parent with three part time jobs. I could go on....There are so many changes that are needed before we have a working democracy!	0

Hockey rinks, seriously? Ever heard of figure skating and recreational skating? The one at the Sullivan arena gets covered over and used for other events. Regarding baseball and football fields, other groups use them like softball and soccer. Exterior B-ball courts are used by all ages and interior courts are gyms that are true lay multi purpose. The motocross track is run by a private club and other motorized users can use it as well not to mention all the dog walkers. Nordic skiing users demand exclusive use of their winter trails and get upset if someone even walks on them. Can others use them like fat bikes, snow shoers, dog walkers? Nope. Skiers don't want to share their precious trails with those groups either. Who pays for the lights on these XC trails? There is no enforcement of a trail pass so these are gov't subsidized trails that continue to cost the public money year after year. Nordic skiing is obviously not as popular as you think or it would not have been cut.	0

Your suggestion sure makes a lot of sense. I also think that those who live in coal-producing areas, while appreciating that they will continue to have jobs in the foreseeable future, should begin to nudge their children toward employment in areas that look forward to a world that is coal-free.

"Andrew, Claiming you're ""lawful"" doesn't make it so. Lawfulness is on the facts. Sure, your organization, through consent, has authority over its membership - which is no different than any other social organization out there. ""Government"" here, however, is that body of authority that exercises the sovereignty of a State. You do not have a State, so do you really have a government? Or is it just a social organization that comes together on occasion and acts like a government (without police powers). How are you different than the Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs? Our people come together from every district to exercise their inherent sovereignty through the Civic Clubs."	0

The only ones talking about ""hating Muslims"" are the Fake News media or the Opposition media. The Fake News Media brainwashed many into thinking that Trump's Muslim Ban was based on religion.

Rather ironic to read an article on tackling radicalization and Muslims written by Sheema Khan. Surely this isn't the same Sheema Khan that was associated with an extremist intolerant Muslim organisation in Canada called CAIR...and its association with the venomous Muslim Brotherhood.

I hope that this young woman is shown mercy and compassion by the Judge in this case. Postpartum depression is a very real thing that does happen to women. The fact that she had just been transferred to Alaska and had no established support system contributed to it. Prior to this, the young woman had been a responsible, contributing member of society. She was a loving and caring mother to her first child and her actions regarding the baby are totally out of character. The fact that during the last three years she has been able to continue to be a responsible, contributing member of society as well as a loving and caring mother to her other children should be taken into consideration. I hope that she will be allowed to remain free to work and be a parent. It is confusing that someone who has an abortion after 22 weeks, when the fetus could be a viable living baby, is not charged. But, the act of a young mother of a newborn, who was under severe mental depression is going to jail.	0

The reference to 'go nuclear' is to change the rules of the US Senate by ending the rule that a 60% vote majority is needed to end a filibuster. Arguably, this would be a good thing (reducing the bar, to say 53%, would be ideal) as the current 60% rule is a major element in the persistent gridlock that paralyzes the Federal Legislative Branch. In the short run, it would aid the reactionary GOP but midterm elections are less than 2 years away. The US really needs to modernize its legislative process and this is a good start.	0

Trump himself has claimed the case is ""Watergate, modern age."" But there is no evidence Clinton even was informed about this deal. The Treasury Department was the key agency that headed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which approved the investment; Clinton did not participate in the CFIUS decision. The deal was also approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Ultimately, only the president could have blocked or suspended the arrangement. Moreover, no uranium produced at U.S. mines may be exported, except for some uranium yellowcake which is extracted and processed in Canada before being returned to the United States for use in nuclear power plants.” From “The ‘dossier’ and the unrainium deal: A guide”"	0

""What Ansaldo did have was local political connections: Ansaldo listed Jeff Coelho, city managing director under former Mayor Mufi Hannemann, as a company executive and Caro­lyn Tanaka, Hannemann's spokeswoman when he ran for governor, as the company's spokeswoman. As the Ansaldo contract came to a head before the Hono­lulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, HART board member Ivan Lui-Kwan disclosed to the Ethics Commission that Ansaldo had asked another partner at his law firm to be its legal counsel. The Ansaldo contract was steered through the HART board by its finance chairman, Don Horner, then the CEO of First Hawaiian Bank, whose French parent company, BNP Pari­bas, has major financial ties to Finmeccanica…."	0

I am fairly certain that the impact of this is that more organizations will get the same freedom rights as the Little Sisters of the Poor, which means full coverage for employees and a way to deny paying for the free coverage without saying to provide it. No one reads Right or Reason anymore, it seems. Or embryology text books. This has been a non-issue from the start, especially since birth control has been covered since December 2000 by order of the EEOC. No one cared them and the only reason they cared now is that Valerie Jarrett set the bihops up. HHS had a non-controverisal plan but Valerie wanted some election publicity and she got it.

"RTH: your statement that Democrats ""did not let anybody read it"" is demonstrably false. Perhaps it is you who did not read the news while Congress spent more than a year holding hundreds of meetings, roundtable discussions and public hearings with experts, lawmakers and stakeholders throughout the healthcare industry. Obama gave a nearly hourlong speech to Congress, laying out his vision and inviting further discussion from both sides of the aisle. Senate Democrats accepted more than 160 Republican amendments to the healthcare bill. And House Democrats held multiple public hearings before and after introducing their legislation in June 2009, allowing relevant committees time to discuss the bill and make amendments long before holding the final House vote four months later."	0
like the stock options plan that Morneau reniged on his plan to tax after he was elected because of the pressure he was feeling and from the talking that occurred with the Bay street financial boys, imagine that...our tax system is fairer to some of the wealthiest people like these ones than the rest of the country, even the middle class who still struggle pay cheque to pay cheque and after these incorporation changes, they will be lucky if their employer is still open for business to offer them a job at all. Dr Niec also sees the clinical side of the social determinants of health and how this taxation will negatively affect that. Good for her to speak out on the topic.

Trump’s Man The thing about Rodrigo Duterte is that for an authoritarian like Trump, he says things that Trump would like to say himself but can’t yet. And you know President Pussy Grabber loves this. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte joked Friday that soldiers could rape up to three women, as he reassured them of his full support under his newly imposed regional martial law. Given that Duterte responded to the rape of his own daughter by calling her a “drama queen,” such horrible inhuman statements are hardly unusual. And this is why Trump loves the guy. Perfect guy to share some sexist jokes and the location of our submarines.	1

I like looking at the Salem City Charter (www.cityofsalem.net/Pages/city-charter.aspx) as it reflects a different approach as to who the hell is in charge. Professional experience and yes pay grades are way above ours, but then they're professionals who tell their City Manager what to do. In our City Charter is says the Council may only SUGGEST to the City Manager. CHANGE the power structure of the Eugene Charter, get city council/mayor professionals in place and let them bring in a 'larger city' manager who communicates with the public. NOW- Our course, make all your pretty design concepts for a Farmers Market and City Hall, but until Lane County can 'get around' the Skinner Donation Land Deed, it's all fantasy. LANE COUNTY has lost twice to get the old city hall lot; by a judge and then the legislature. Official City Hall might be a building 'guest' of Lane County's for 4+ years, but it's still a non-county purpose as is a full-time market and a new City Hall on county property.	0

"How much has the ""Kicker"" returned to taxpayers since inception? It's nuts to keep it with a $22 billion-and-hemorrhaging deficit. First off, it would be good to see an explanation, with figures, about this historic nightmare and how it came to be. A 5-year old can see that selling off the assets of a company that is bleeding dollars at an astounding rate isn't even a tourniquet, it's an aspirin. We need a full-response ER economic team. Governor Brown needs to start shedding some light, doing some corporate-style thinking. When the assets are gone, for all future Oregonians, and that deficit has continued to grow, what next? Those who vilify Democrats need to wake up. This problem isn't one party's doing, it's been brewing for decades. And underlining partisanship at this sink-or-swim junction hardly is productive to a solution. First off, stem the bleeding. I see no long term strategy, at all."	0

Birth control is not abortion because anyone who understands the details of gastrulation knows that this is a more likely marker of the start of individual life (before then, the genetics of the mother control development). As for the Mexico City policy executive order, it is standard and likely all that Right to Lifers will ever do for the voters that support them. Indeed, it is all they can do. Roe is not going anywhere. The only Federalist Society Justice that believed that abortion should be a state matter is now dead and his replacement will likely vote with Justices Kennedy, Alito and Chief Roberts that this matter is settled law. There are not enough states to ratify the Human Life Amendment and any federal law moving the start of life earlier will likely simply ratify the status quo. In other words, the movement is a fraud because it promises results it can never achieve. (Had Clinton focused on these facts she might have won).	0

Dozens of Republicans have signed an open letter urging Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to shift resources away from the Trump campaign to House and Senate races instead. According to a report by Politico, the letter urges the RNC to shift resources to vulnerable congressional races in order to “prevent the GOP from drowning with a Trump-emblazoned anchor around its neck.” “We believe that Donald Trump’s divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a Democratic landslide,” the letter reads, according to the report, which urges “the immediate shift of all available RNC resources to vulnerable Senate and House races.” “This should not be a difficult decision,” the letter continues, “as Donald Trump’s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day.” http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/republicans-sign-letter-urging-rnc-to-cut-off-trump-funds	0

Competition is fine. But this isn't selling TVs or cell phones. This is a party nomination where only one person advances to the real competition (the general election). This is more like picking your starting QB BEFORE the real competition starts. Last year's 5-way race (damn judges petition rulings) was a perfect example. The highly diluted field allowed someone without broad appeal (Glenn) to take the nomination with just 37% of the vote. The result in November was predictable. They really need to switch to instant runoff voting where there's more than 2 candidates in the race. Until they have that, then the party needs to practice the age-old method of weeding down the field internally before the primary. That had already happened last year until a damn judge decided to ignore the ballot petition rules.	1

Basically you're arguing that there was no one here, that this land was free for the taking. It's sort of sad and strange that you're basing your thinking on one white man's interpretation over thousands of Indigenous people's collective history and teachings. I'm sorry to burst your little white supremacist bubble bud, but you could not be more wrong and more ignorant....about everything. First, Indigenous people have peopled this continent for millennia. Their history and civilization predates yours by several thousand years. And there were millions at first contact. Get it through your thick skull that you and your ilk are not the authority on Indigenous people's existence and never will be. Also, understand that their title and rights still exist today as this land you call Canada was never ceded or surrendered. It matters not what numbers Indigenous populations may have dwindled to after European diseases and genocide were introduced. Squatting does not equal ownership.	1

"Interesting that the two words ""liberal and Progressive"", the best adjectives to describe the United State Constitution, are now given revisionist meaning to the point of curses against all human rights activity within the same U.S. The false dictionary of the White Supremacist, Old South CONfederacy, Neo-CONservative, Neo-Republican dogma determined to destroy the nation to re-establish the Old South Plantation system now called Corporations. The depth of stupidity and ignorance afoot in the nation is a bottomless pit of lies and deceit from the top on down. Time for a Revolution to clean house one more time."	1
You're right Gary. I appreciate having a great piece ofass to show off, every bit as much as Trump does. I now understand how being POTUS is an untouchable position, making meetings with heads of state ever so profitable. Truth be told, I really don't give a rip about the struggles of the average American, as long as they are citizens who have earned their place in this country, even if that means marrying some older rich guy to get here. When Trump cuts taxes for the wealthy and the mega-conglomerates get contracts to build wealth - I mean infrastructure - I'm certain that it will please the Emperor and his singers. That's all I really need to know, is that Donald has my best interest at heart. Gotta go, I'm running low on Valium, pot and gin.	1

Kind of a non sequitur. Canadian's concerns also include MY concerns, being Canadian, and if they federal budget simply handed me a 380Bn dollar cheque this year, I think the rest of Canada might have something to say about it. We all pay into the system expecting our federal government to use the tax dollars for the broadest possible benefits to Canadians, and the Feds have that constitutional mandate to treat us all equally, so any attempt to preferentially direct those funds to interest groups will be met with some resistance. The more ideological or illogical that direction seems to be, the greater the resistance. At this point, it's clear Trudeau is a fully blown gender ideologue. Why should ordinary Canadians be happy that our PM wants to praise, extoll and fund 51% of the population over the other 49% enough to use the federal budget to do so?	0

But his point is that if we already have a housing crisis here, with 15,000+ homeless, 100,000+ hidden homeless and 278,000+ people getting food from the food bank, Then how is bringing in 10,000 more people that need housing & food and have no way to afford it, or anything else, going to ""help"" our EXISTING problem RIGHT NOW? We so determined to help someone, how about all of those fishermen basically held captive in our own harbor?

The SCC also said indigenous landowners cannot veto projects that will extend beyond the scope of those lands and/or deliver benefit to the nation as a whole -- also striking the rational among us as fair. Courts don't always deliver the answer those clamoring for answers want, but its irresponsible, immature and shortsighted to take that as cause to burn the courts. PS.

I'm not sure where you are getting your version of events - lifesite or some other unreliable source? Find a legitimate source - much of what you relate is untrue. His background and activities are both fascinating and frightening. He did learn that she was a lesbian before the mass. He did refuse to give her communion. He did leave the altar while she gave a eulogy for her mother (permitted). And he did refuse to go to the gravesite. He did not attempt to find another priest to help the family, but one was found by someone else, a priest who understands what being a priest means. He is from another country; he was removed from the parish by the Archdiocese. Cdl. Wuerl has publicly stated that he opposes denying communion to Catholics. Wuerl has refused urgings from the Catholic right to deny communion to many Catholic politicians living in the DC area who are pro-choice (which is not the same thing as pro-abortion) and who also regularly attend mass and receive communion.	0

Come on, you have the gun, and if a cop is going to be that stupid, to get close enough(or in the open with no cover) he has no business being a cop isnt the saying ""to up hold the law"" not ""to be above the law"". Well, just my opinion shooting someone and killing them no matter what is murder. Cops are trained on there weapons so they know the differance between a kill shot and a injured shot,and if they dont then they have no right to carry a gun. This officer did it right,and i thank him very much for his control and judgement durning this problem. To me he deserves a medal."	1

I agree that the parents should not confront the coach directly and should go through the process. In the parents defense they have already had meetings with the principal and ad about the program and had come to an agreement that they would play a limited season because of the low number of players. I disagree with you that you should allow a bad coach to continue as long as he does not endanger the kids. If a coach is so bad that a player who loves the game and his school would rather not play or move to a different school says a lot. If a coach cannot attract even the minimum numbers of players to field a team ensures the lack of opportunity for the players to compete. The bottom line is that results matter whether you are a coach, an educator, a businessman or a politician.	0
"Right, first it's an English Professor refusing to submit to the demands of perpetually offended social justice warriors - then it's world war and mass genocide. The fact that a tenured professor risks losing his job over ""gender pronouns"" only highlights the regression of North American universities as spineless administrators kow tow to the demands of self-involved whiners (lest the knives get pointed at them). This issue is a non-issue. Free speech is either free or it isn't - self-appointed hall monitors policing free speech on the basis of their own self-righteous ignorance is a disgrace to academia.

""Comey needs to provide full info immediately. Otherwise he has clearly made a partisan intervention, betraying his office."" That wasn't a ""meltdown, which would be hysterical blathering. That was a very rational statement of the truth about Comey's partisan meddling, without any proof whatsoever, in the election 11 days away. Your stupid magazine called it a ""meltdown"" because it is a cheezy partisan rag. You picked up the inapt ""meltdown"" because you have no brain of your own."	1

Do you really want to know? Quit being politically correct and profile those who might possibly commit acts of terror or mass shootings, quit molly coddling criminals, enforce the current laws and increase the sentences, use gun criminals for hard labor, for thieves who steal guns increase sentences and and lengthen parole/probation periods with more frequent visits and make the PO's do their jobs by actually checking on felons. Now YOU tell me how taking away MY 2nd amendment rights or making it more difficulty for me to exercise those rights will do anything to stop criminals from being criminals! You're so condescendingly smart. So explain why taking what is essentially a tool away from a person who properly and legally uses that tool will stop mass shootings, gun violence and criminal behavior.	0

State and local Republicans have expanded early voting in GOP-dominated areas and restricted it in Democratic areas, an IndyStar investigation has found, prompting a significant change in Central Indiana voting patterns. From 2008 to 2016, GOP officials expanded early voting stations in Republican dominated Hamilton County, IndyStar’s analysis found, and decreased them in the state’s biggest Democratic hotbed, Marion County. That made voting more convenient in GOP areas for people with transportation issues or busy schedules. And the results were immediate. The only evidence of any voter fraud involves Republicans defrauding the public.	0

Many thanks Liberal MPP Arthur Potts for causing Airmiles to reverse their STUPID decision to cancel earned miles. When I looked into using up my relatively low amount of miles earlier this year, there was nothing worth while obtaining from their goods. Just a few days ago I noticed there were a few items I may have obtained, although I was not big on them. Then I would have destroyed my Airmiles card. Now I'll keep it at least another year, but I would expect then to try something else negative to their customers. I also had trouble with Aeroplane miles, of which I collected many via my credit card purchases. But getting a desired flight was a problem, of limited seats and having to take inconvenient flights including extra not desired stops. So a few years ago switched my Aeroplane credit card to a card which gives points giving the choice of any flight and even paying the tax on same.	1

"Clinton was a philanderer. Whether he abused his power to ""take advantage of,"" assaulted or raped women, we can't know with any certainty. The background to these accusations are thick with political intrigue. Were these women paid off by Clinton's enemies to bring charges against him? Or were they indeed victims of a sexual predator? Joe Conason and Gene Lyons have written extensively on these issues. They are Clinton sympathizers who make a decent case that while Clinton was a careless adulterer, he wasn't guilty of sex crimes. At any rate, Trump is a threat to the country and to the world. That's all that matters in this election."	1
Getting control of the borders and enforcing immigration laws is a giant accomplishment. Why? Because it was guaranteed to upset the DC power structure, republicans and democrats alike. He's made Paul Ryan look small, petty and ineffective as Ryan is the very definition of the DC establishment. The democrat leadership is also chasing it's tail because Trump doesn't respond to the usual dirty tricks and media ridicule that have hobbled republicans in the past. In short Trump is beating progressives at their own game. And as for the manufactured protests: Pretty soon the useful id!0ts will lose interest and only paid protestors and forced protestors (union members) will remain. They're running out of protest topics anyway. #MAGA. Oh yeah, almost forgot. Lock her up!	0
Colleges and universities have become nothing more than left wing effeminate white male bashing indoctrination camps..they reek of hard core liberalism.Most jobs really do not or should not require college education...trade schools are better options these days..there will always be a need for electricians..plumbers..construction..etc..Tech schools are also another alternative option.Not everyone is cut out for college anyway..today it seems your forced to go to college in order to be employed...many of these kids simply don't belong..resulting in thuggish behavior and criminal activity on campus.Why is there such an emphasis on higher learning or a need for a degree in fields that once never required them?Is it to further brainwash your children into accepting a more socialist society that will one day erode their freedoms..or is it to keep families in heavy debt..paying for a degree that will most likely never end up paying for itself?	1

Thanks for the link. I don't dispute it's finding that temperatures are increasing at an unusual rate. I keep in mind a quote from The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. We must test all intellectually respectable lines of inquiry, while keeping in mind that, “it is very difficult to predict — especially about the future.”  My concern is not necessarily about the science or having policies in place to protect our environment. My problem is with how you go about doing it. The Paris Accord assumes all countries will comply with the pledges they made even tho there's no consequences if they don't. Look at NATO. Out of 28 countries, only 5 contributed to their defense as promised. There are no consequences for the other 25 countries that violate the agreement. Out of 194 countries in the Paris Accord, how many would you guess will comply with the agreement? The U.S. for sure, because like NATO we are the stupid rich kid.	1
"Yes I could, and will, as long was reactionaries and bigots use the actions of some Muslims, or any group, to vilify that group as a whole.

This whole incident was very poorly handled by the airlines and police. The airline company wanted the seats to accommodate their own employees. It was not an issue of overbooking in my opinion as has been reported by the drive by media. One of the police officers involved is now facing disciplinary acton for not following proper procedures, the last I heard. This is also a garans ball bearings law suit case. If the airline needed to get their employees to another destination, they should have booked them on another flight. Very stupid decision making on the part of the airline higher ups.	1

A larger tax base (ie more immigrants) means that our national debt is distributed over a greater population, so technically the people responsible for building up the debt in the first place are reducing their debt exposure. I do not see why that is a negative or anything that should be discouraged. Second, the value of land and real estate (most investment assets, actually) MUST rise in a low inflation rate environment where interest rates are falling, or have fallen. That has little to do with foreigners, and, ultimately, the price of land is going up until inflation returns anyways. The curious thing is that with all of this skyrocketing real estate, and substantial outside demand, how is it possible that real estate developers have not been keeping pace? What's really going on?	0

Trumps a moron. This whole thing is ridiculous. They are protesting something they believe in, and if the NFL doesn't care, why should he?

What all murderers share in common is a selfish disregard for the value and sanctity of life. And isn't it all a matter of degree? From a Stalin, Mao and Hitler to those believing they are doing God's (or Allah's) will to the Las Vegas shooter who apparently wanted notoriety to the Gacys and Dahlmers, and then to one who ends the life of an unborn human child only for the sake of convenience. Then there is Christ's declaration that a person who hates another has already committed a murder in his or her heart. We can point in all sorts of directions to figure out why, but we need to look no further than the human heart, ours as well as theirs.	0

Who cares what a CEO makes. I mean, a CEO runs a company and provides jobs for thousands. They also are responsible for their company's share price so shareholders of publicly traded companies like you and I can retire comfortably. I just received 2000 dollars in dividends from Telus, Rogers, and a few other publicly traded companies and thanks to them, this goes up every six months or yearly. I don't have the business talent to run Telus or these companies but I'm glad someone else does. As usual, the far left likes to blame others for their own woes. The money that pays the CEO doesn't come from the taxpayers. Why are they not outraged when their own liberal politicians spend money on their Dear Leader JT, so he can conveniently get more Chinese to come over to buy up our houses and jack up our rents? Maybe the far left should look in the mirror and see that the problem is their own leader has sold them out. Pathetic as usual.	1

"You seem to disregard that everyone pays a sales tax, and revenue increases and decreases seasonally. Everyone that sells pays a sales tax to the state and passes that on to the consumer. The tax would be on transactions , and not on hard earned , declining, incomes. The burden would be shouldered equally by all instead of directly out of the pocket of the wage earner. Investors also would be required to pay the sales tax, even though taxes are not deducted directly from their income. The source of the tax would NOT be subject to the loss of jobs in a single sector of the economy, whereas an income tax is directly affected. either way more tax will be paid. The question id do we take only from the Residents, or add the tourist to the tax base and enact a sales tax that does not unduly burden the wage earner , while allowing businesses write offs, but giving them an unfair advantage because they do not pay "" income taxes ""."	0

I agree, totally ! I was laid off in the summer of 2009 due to economical downturn and have to find my own work, so I incorporated myself. Since then I was able to find work for about 6 months in a year and what little I made have to go towards living expenses and tried to save some for retirement. Obviously that amount of saving would not go into a saving account but invested in solid dividend stocks, go figure. Now the government thinks we are rich individuals that take advantage of passive investment returns and are gouging the public coffer. It is really, really sad. They are doing this to sound noble but in fact they are looking at getting the uninformed public to vote for them next year. I am really saddened by what Canada has become.	0

All you’re really saying is you have contempt for Donald Trump. That’s does not provide much grist for a discussion, particularly on how the Church might have a vital role in healing the nation. Nor have you described what “bargain with the devil” was made, which also rather precludes pursuing the topic further. Assuming both candidates to be suboptimal, I took a look at both party platforms and their respective candidate’s statements. On the one side both the platform and the candidate were foursquare for removing all restrictions on abortions, removing the Hyde Amendment which forbids Federal funding for abortions, and continuing the war on provisions for conscientious objection to abortion and contraception.	0

Remember how Oly was really very popular here during the late 1960s?	0

Yes, he was a gay man. How do I know this? Because he raped young boys. Straight men don't rape boys. They don't fantasize about boys, or men. Ever.

Sorry to break it to you, but it's not true.	1
The author, who is not a relative, has fundamentally misrepresented President Trumps view on immigration. Mr. Trump is not against immigration per se; what he is against is illegal immigration. He may well be also against Moslem immigration as well but officially he has only called for more rigorous screening. Illegal, or undocumented, immigration to the USA has depressed wages at the low end of the economy, the main victims being African-Americans and others with poor levels of education as subsidizing sunset industries that simply rely on cheap labour. Yes America needs immigration but it needs to be more selective and more focussed on the skills America needs to grow its economy. Even within the legal immigration system, there is too much emphasis on admitting non-nuclear relatives. George W. Bush tried to change this and got stymied by Republican hardliners in the Senate. The current Republican congressional leadership realizes that was a mistake. Hopefully they will correct it.	0

Personally, I'd much rather hire a young hard charger with a chip on his shoulder than someone who ""checks all the boxes"" but reeks of entitlement and expects that their education and background automatically grants them a six figure job with a 35 hour work week, and work content designed specifically for them. Oh, and on a related note, if you value your sanity, try to avoid entitled spouses who ""check all the boxes."""	0

It should be noted that in 1991 WesPac instituted the 50-mile exclusion zone around the Main Hawaiian Islands and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to prevent the longliners from hooking monk seals, as well as reduce interaction with turtles and birds. This reserve was later declared a monument by Pres. Bush in 2006. WesPac has never been given due credit for what was until recently one of the biggest conservation measures in the Pacific. And what very few realize is that along with ensuring a sustainable fishery, WesPac's duty is to protect habitat as well as wildlife. This is deemed by congressional mandate via the Magnuson-Stevens Act in 1976. The UN has declared Hawaii's bigeye tuna fishery as the model fishery for the rest of the world to emulate and has kept the area in pristine condition. WesPac is, in fact, a conservation organization just like the others attending the IUCN World Conservation Congress. Unlike many others it has a record showing real results.	0

"We have made a habit in American politics of not voting for a candidate we believe in but instead voting against the candidate we fear. For years we have allowed fear to override both our conscience and our common sense and that is exactly what the multinational corporations with their corrupt politicians and corrupt media want us to continue doing. How many times have you heard someone say or even said yourself ""I don't really like so-an-so but I'm voting for the least of two evils"". I admit I've been guilty of this same flawed reasoning. But its our tolerance of the lesser evil, of the less corrupt politician that has perpetuated an ever increesing parade of horrible political candidates.

The move appears to support the Gulf Arab country when it faces diplomatic and trade isolation from some of the biggest Middle Eastern powers.

One of the issues that is causing so much damage to the Roman Catholic faith and to many faith traditions is to not realize that many of our beliefs, traditions, rituals are embedded in the viewpoint of a particular culture. The Christian Jesus that we think we know is the Jewish man as described by other Jewish men who thought through their own cultural lens, who's writings are interpreted by men living in a Roman culture using cultural philosophies of Greece and Rome. Who is Jesus and how is what he said and did interpreted to someone raised in Eastern traditions? What would beliefs and rituals look like if the first to expound and expand on the writings of MMLJ had been Asian, or Native American? Maybe we all need a cultural relevant basis for belief and faith; and therefore many faiths in the world. But, the particulars of the faith are not nearly as important as the Golden Rule, as how we treat each other. Don't think God would have a problem with that.	0

I'd call his very personal emotional makeup and his moral character strong negatives. If we were to focus on the ""positives"" we might ask: 1) Which candidate has the better understanding of the issues a President will face? 2) Which candidate has the most experience in governance? 3) Which candidate has the most experience in international relations? 4) Which candidate has shown throughout his or her life more compassion and empathy for others? 5) Which candidate would be the more stable, rational person to lead our nation?

Turning a football field into something it's not is no different than turning a golf course into something it's not.

But as we've seen with Denver, they've figured out how to mismanage city parks and recreation areas.... now it just might include a golf course. Such a dumb idea by people with blinders on. Finally, I could supply a long list of land being used for specific purposes that could be more extensively used for others..... close off the zoo, I can bring in a lot more people with more money being spent if I can have a three day concert, forget any inconvenience to zoo customers.

Er, what is 'homosexual conduct'? And where does 'God's law' say 'no' to it? You see I think of homosexual conduct as committed love. And love, true love, is many things more than one. Where does God ban this? You clearly equate homosexual conduct with one thing: an*l s*x. So we are at cross-purposes here. Are you sure that old cardinal you quoted wasn't a closeted (though perhaps not closeted to everyone), self-loathing gay man himself? He certainly sounds the type to my ears. You're obviously not aware that many hetero-couples engage in this kind of s*x, and that many gay couples do not.	1

If this whole ridiculous, totally artificial 'crisis' did anything, it laid bare how insincere, untrustworthy and sleazy 'American democracy' really is. An antiquated electoral system that hasn't changed for 200 years with its cast-in-stone bi-partisan political structure, where policy differences between the 2 parties are miniscule and immoral amounts of money are being spent in the 'electoral process' yields only perennial bickering with no real achievement, except maybe the (rapid) growth of the federal deficit and the sway of the military-industrial complex. And when the preordained results do not materialise and the unexpected happens, the entire political class (both parties) is up in arms in unison: that there must have been an external 'intervention' an 'attack against our democracy' that needs to be pushed back against and the perpetrators must be punished. Never mind, that there is no solid proof. None. It is an insult to the intellect of the American voter.	1

It would be good for the country. We just came from nearly 10 years of a government that had no use for science that did not support its ideology. We don't need another.	1

This does position the Prime Minister as blatantly hypocritical. Wiping criminal records for simple possession is an obvious step as the country moves to full legalization.

Or US citizen living in Asia? Making yourself feel good about being a kick butt American by talking tough is the type of macho garbage that makes sense if actual, unprovoked threats are occurring. But, Trump is provoking and propogating those threats. To what end? WW3? The international compact has been, til now, NK existing in its adversarial posture, to recognize China's concern over its northern border, and to allow balance of adversarial interests in East Asia. Almost 60 years of relative peace has ensued. Within 7 months, accelerated over the past month and definitely the past 2 days, Trump has managed to completely destablize East Asia. Why? To be macho? Why? What's the use? There was a military standoff at the Korean DMZ. Nukes don't change that. China doesn't want proliferation there. Ever.	1

"""Walking without due care and attention is as dangerous as running a red light, speeding or distracted driving. "" Sure; I remember, just a couple weeks ago, there was a pedestrian who wasn't paying attention, walked into an intersection, hit a streetcar, bounced off it, and slammed a cyclist against the wall, killing him. The pedestrian walked away, and probably won't face any significant consequences."	0
"Use of word ""Japanese"" makes complete sense as this is Memorial Day weekend. To say what the tweet said is boneheaded. Dumb. Reprimand him, fine. Make him apologize publicly, fine.

And what a train wreck it is. I cannot fathom how a state that is so incensed by the guy in the white house, not only is willing to sit idly by and continue to allow this to go on, but in reality encourages it. Every time we vote one of the same council members, mayor, representatives, senators, congressmen (or women), or governor, we become a part of the problem. Hawaii, unless we wake up, we are all in for a very bumpy ride that will end in a wreck of biblical proportions.	0
"All of you Trump supporters who grew up watching the Nazi propaganda tapes, saying, ""how did that ever happen?"" Be Proud. Be very, very f'ing proud. You are now those people. You are now the uneducated sheeple, living among the human ash and denying that you see anything wrong, while lies, distortions, and outright laughable provable bullshit is fed to you on a loop of right wing cable news and you suck it up like a mint julep on a plantation porch."	1

"Enough is Enough. The Democratic Party is imploding and is financially, morally, ethically and politically bankrupt. Reformers are notoriously absorbed and gagged by the Corporates within the leadership and have been for decades. Democrats fail to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the many heinous crimes they have committed against the American people. It's time We the People rise up and found a party for the People, by the People. We have volunteers in all 50 states with 40,000 signatures on-hand, which is increasing every day. Join our campaign to convince Senator Sanders, who is an Independent after all, to ditch his ""reform"" efforts of the #DefunctDems and pull his millions upon millions of supporters to register and build a new, replacement party.

"Beegor writes: ""Concerning USA allegations of Russia hitting hospitals, I think most of them have been debunked."" -- Actually, most have been proven. Destroyed hospitals and dead bodies make for convincing evidence. Particularly in areas where only Russian air military are operating. http://www.msf.ca/en/issue/aleppo-under-fire?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=grants&utm_content=textad&utm_campaign=aleppo&gclid=CjwKEAjwoLfHBRD_jLW93remyAQSJABIygGpNeE-qecq9d0tOcH7jpO0OqFHYTuLY4R0R1H1LSytohoCbbzw_wcB As for US bombing of hospitals, the US government investigated the Kunduz bombing, determined that it was the fault of the US military, that it was an unintentional mistake, President Obama personally apologized and the US government compensated the victims and their families. Same process for the Mosul hospital. Contrast the US response to accidental bombings to that of the deliberate Russian policy of attacking hospitals, and denial. Assad and Putin, bloody brothers."	0
As far as the 1960s up until the 1980s the French were notorious for that sort of arrogance. But then, maybe they had good reason up to a point. French was the former accepted language of diplomacy, just as German, to a large extent, was for science (but not any more - the Germans may regret that, but they lost two world wars, so who cares much what they think). Like Latin in the Western civilizations of the past, English presently holds sway as the world's lingua franca. For those unaware, it's also the language of civil aviation. Will it remain so a thousand years hence? Maybe not, but neither do I think Chinese or Spanish as we know them today will claim that title either.	0
"Politics and energy projects are a disaster for Canada. Muskrat Falls, Ontario gas plant fiasco, Ontario wind power fiasco, now BC Hydro Site C disaster.

This is Donald Trump we are talking about. The first Executive Order is only blustering bully talk to justify signing the second Executive Order on using the Customs and Border Protection to collect on current trade disputes. Most of which are with China. Posturing for a trade war with China most definitely enhances Russia's stability.	0

"And, why is Mr Bannon doing this? The technique that he is employing was developed by MI6, the British Intelligence Service, during the early part of the Second World War. Hint: it's all about finding out who has been leaking information about President Trump from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Some people might call it: ""priming the pump"". Not really surprised that nobody has figured this out yet. Have a nice day."	0
Greg, understand how you feel....however our City is in a world of financial hurt from what has / has not been done with our current regime. Unfortunately there has not been enough challenges made to the Mayor to look at all options....not all stones were turned over. Jim Berrios is the best solution to get the city out of the financial crisis we are in. Jim will return Kent to a profitable and sound community....stay tuned! Mr. Energizer!	0
Treasonous and criminal activity to can you give some examples or are you just throwing it out there first of Trump jokingly said He hopes the hacker's could find the 50.000 emails Hillary illegally deleted. So that is a bad thing it was a joke!!!! And there is no concrete proof they hacked podesta's emails or Hillaries because is that not what the FBI's conclusions where . You are a left minded narrow minded one sided thinke who believes Hillary or Obama could do no wrong. Give your head a shake the clintons are worth 10's of millions of dollars because of what? they went from dead broke to millionaires because of what there foundation haas raped and pillaged governments all over the world and you call into question Trump Ask your self about Aleppo is that Trumps Fault or the Clinton foundation wasting billions they received to help Hati or did trump have a hand in that or maybe Bush	0
And for exactly that reason, it is unacceptable to allow that an oligarch from another continent control their education. If the state mandate the education, then the state shall provide it. Are you ready and willing to pay for the abuse of children in the care of the church?	0
Well Layla they took a lot of abuse as a result of killing Jesus for reasons of greed. Now having said that it is deplorable the abuse they took in subsequent generations for this as children should not be held accountable for the sins of the father. Of course you can also say some abuse before Jesus was a result of their monotheism the same as Mohamed suffered in Mecca for promoting one god. Civilization was more pantheistic or multi-God and that was seen as different. Either way the Jewish race is an amazing race and they need to move past this intolerance and despicable behaviour taking place in Israel that is making them look like immoral and selfish people.	1

The biggest boost to Anchorage's economy for many years has been the AFN convention, probably is to Fairbanks, too, now. Villagers flying in (and boosting local/state airlines) to stay in hotels, eat at restaurants, shop in Anchorage stores....giving a big boost to the local urban economy. Ask businesses like 6th Avenue Outfitters, Army Navy Surplus/Big Ray's or any of the big-chain stores like Walmart, Freddie's, Costco or Sam's Club just how much money is generated from the bush alone? Betcha you'd be surprised. Do some homework before spouting ignorance.	1

I could not disagree more vehemently Steven! For two straight years Republican Majority leadership has controlled the gavel of every single committee in the legislature. For two straight years the Republican Majority leadership didn't pass a single minority bill or amendment. For two straight years majority leadership has known they would have a massive budget deficit that logic dictates would need to be filled with draws on the CBR. For two straight years majority leadership has known that in the case of a CBR draw a 3/4 vote of each body is necessary. And for two straight years Minority Leader Tuck and his tight knit band of 13 independents and democrats have stood by waiting to get engaged with the leadership; and have offered olive branch after olive branch trying to reach out and share the burden. But to little avail. And now ALL are to blame? Maybe if viewed through some magic fairy-dusted kaleidoscope, but not in the actual world.	0
Another mass killer wanna be saved by his own stupidity. Crappy shot, unprepared who ran out of bullets. Fabulous. Want to bet he is another card carrying member of Welfare Nation? No employer listed. .... Now he has moved to the other side of Welfare Nation, Criminal. Another loser I am not interested in giving more chances or rehabilitate. Drinking is not the issue, his lack of desire to live a better life and get a job is the issue. He would rather get drunk on home brew, hit women and then take pot shots at people when he gets mad. Cut the cancer from society. Hang him. Use our resources for those that deserve it and will contribute to society in a postive way. Cut the cancer.	1
"Even the G&M asks commenters to ""be respectful,"" and tests posts for ""civility."" If not ""civil,"" the post is deleted. (There are those who consider some of the deletions ""censorship,"" to suit the G&M's own biases--but in this comment's context that's beside the point.) Yes, the right to ""offensive"" speech is part of the overall right to free speech. But to my mind, ""offensive"" speech--besides being offensive--is far less effective than a well-reasoned-out statement of opinion, however ""passionately"" delivered. IMHO, resorting to foul language and slurs is a sign of a lazy mind--of a person who either doesn't have the mental wherewithal or simply can't be bothered to organize and present her views in a civil, civilized--and thus perhaps persuasive--manner. Profanity is no argument. Or is the satisfaction she may derive from showing her contempt--even hatred--for others more important to her than being persuasive? Why should anybody give attention--or credence--to somebody like that?"	0
