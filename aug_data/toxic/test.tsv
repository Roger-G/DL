"... and this whopper: ""Economics supports an income tax. It would cost fewer jobs than an equal Permanent Fund dividend cut""  According to the ISER report, a $650 m income tax will result in the loss of 3,536 to 5,109 jobs. An equivalent PFD cut will result in the loss of 3,627 to 5,798 jobs. The job losses are very similar, hardly ammunition to back up a claim that ""economics supports an income tax"".  http://www.akleg.gov/basis/get_documents.asp?session=30&docid=1326"	0

"What is the ""freedom to practice religion""? Is that the freedom to go to the church I want? The Bible teaches me that that ""true religion is ... to keep yourself unstained by the world."" In other words, it matters to God how I live my life outside of church ... and that would include how I conduct my business and whether or not I will be seen to condone the sin of others. My ""religious worship"" does not just happen at church or in my home, but goes with me where ever I am."	0
A big shoutout to the staff and member activists of the Colorado Sierra Club for their work developing City of Denver on this path!

Are you serious?  Japan is under major stress because of their population situation - many many articles written for many years on this now.  They are shrinking in population & size of their economy - meanwhile they have massive government debt.  The combo of the two is devasting - they are headed for disaster without significant changes.  Problem is, not everyone in Japan is open to immigration, but the alternative is watch your wealth and world standing disapear	0

Globalization = Global pollution and 'climate change' - It is so hypocritical to promote both. Globalization has pushed India and China into giant toxic smog filled nations where the air is unbreathable. Sure globalization has help some poor people out of poverty but it has also create so much misery for millions of people on the plant. - We should 'stop the clock', stop immigration, stop mass trade. Are we really helping millions of people working it toxic factories earns pennies per the hour so we can have cheap goods? Immigration is destroying our communities our culture or civilization.

When it comes to Bombardier, the PM could kills two birds with one stone. Buy 120 Saab JAS-39E Gripens and manufacture them at Bombardier. Then again, he may have to make really nice with the new El Presidente and buy American.

And the PM is a Quebecer anyway. You can get higher than that.	0
"Here's the problem:  the RG is a business that needs customers to  survive; and those customers seem to prefer stories of crime, violence and deviance--""The old ""If it bleeds it leads"" cliche.

I look at these departures two different ways and neither one is good. Either all of these high level Directors are jumping the continued train wreck of the Hickenlooper administration or they are selfish and greedy people who only used their Director position to promote themselves and get lucrative private sector jobs.

Electric cars need replaceable standardized batteries so that on a long trip, the car can pull in to a recharge station, get the battery replaced with a fully charged one, and drive away within five or ten minutes.

"The idea that this is being framed as an issue of equity is crazy. Illegals are not allowed to get driver's license in the person who is complaining, own country, Bolivia. The entire reason for the ""pilot programs"" in California, Maryland, DC and other jurisdictions was to reduce the number of uninsured. Notice that main reason has now dropped out of the conversation? That is because in California, Maryland and DC they have found that after they get the licenses they are still more likely to be uninsured, and all these programs have vastly increased the number of uninsured illegals driving on the roads. Also if an illegal from Bolivia has had a half dozen drunk driving arrests we have no way of finding out."	0

It's time to dismantle the incoherent bafflegab of posts like yours.    Canada's age class distribution of its spruce pine dominated boreal and sub boreal forests is getting older.  These post climatic climax forests are increasingly stagnant and characterized by decay processes.  Not only is the CO2 produced by standing decay not fully accounted for but these millions of hectares of stands are also producing increasing quantities of CO2 from respiration.  That's right, MACKINNONJWM, trees BREATHE just like all living organisms.  While Forests yield oxygen and consume atmospheric CO2 via photosynthesis, they also consume O2 for metabolic processes. It's called respiration and older, stagnant forests yield MORE CO2 from respiration than they produce O2 from photosynthesis.  canada's capacity to act as a carbon sink is great, but only if we recycle these aging, declining stands via harvest/reforestation or allowing them to burn naturally instead of suppressing fire as we do.	0

"I read my previous comments and thought I needed to add a point.  When I used to advise people concerning public relations, I would focus them on ""intent.""  As in law, in public relations intent is a central issue.  Even a statement of fact can be inappropriate, if the intent was malicious.  There are few things more malicious than trying to deny one the ability to make a living by using a public forum to embarrass them.  As noted by another reader, the grievances against Ms. Lange are petty.  If being late for a meeting or missing a meeting are grounds for demanding dismissal, we live in sad times.  If not responding immediately to a request for attention when you are in your office with your door closed is a crime, things have gone too far.

Didn't we go over this alread? Hard head I guess. Let's try again. The notion that only illegals pick crops and work construction is laughable and racist. You are a racist who pretends their ballot choices absolves them of their mean spirit. Yes, Americans work construction and pick crops! I'm glad we were able to answer your great question. Moreover, if we enforced immigration and labor laws then we would see some natural economic forces at work. Food prices would rise for people in urban areas as wages increased to fill vacant positions in farming. Construction costs would parallel. Then things would shift as consumers and producers made choices. People would move and jobs would be filled. I'm sure we would read fewer articles about economic depression in rural America.

I think that is my biggest misgiving with the Libertarian platform--the idea that the free market will do an adequate job of making companies accountable for any public harm (this is normally filed under the more reviled title of government regulations). They say that if harm is proven (for example, a company has been dumping heavy metals in a stream) then they will be appropriately fined. But that puts the burden on proving the company is doing harm through litigation. My belief is that companies even under current rules are too free to exploit in the name of profit, not too regulated. But if you take most of the Lib social platforms and add corporate regulation you end up Dem.	0

Wow there are so many things wrong with this situation.  Its bad enough to tell everyone you are taking an extra long vacation but when you throw in the cold weather factor you are entering Marie Antoinette territory.   Then you make it worse by telling us you can't be bothered to get a computer hookup because you like to do business the old fashioned way only makes this situation more laughable.  So not only do you look entitled and out of touch you also sound like a caveman.   You then try to mitigate your damages by telling us you work so hard it makes up for the time you are away.

"Trump has re-stocked the swamp with a new breed of alligator.  I suspect that Trump considers ""ethics problems"" to be problems having to comply with rules run by an Obama  appointee. Given that he has suggested he can ""comply"" by handing over his business to his children to run while still owning them, he doesn't see any problem with his billionaire friends and their financial assets.

I wish I had had a an older friend when I was his age!  While it may seem like a double standard there is a big difference between young males and young females having sex with older people.

"Do any of the buildings at Country Village conform to the description of  ""historical""?  If so, it would seem to have some bearing on what can and should be done.  I do understand the dilemma that the Loveless family faces and trust that their intentions are sincere.  Given the facts and circumstances, it seems like Rod Loveless was inspired to do a good thing when he created Country Village and that Bryan Loveless and the rest of the family want to preserve the ideals behind it.  If they can hang in there, another solution may come to light.  Most of us can agree that cramming another 200 homes solely for profit would be painfully disappointing on many counts.  If the Loveless family is open to ideas, maybe there is still light at the end of the tunnel.  The folks who own Wights in Lynnwood sold their property to Snohomish County Senior Services.

Muckamuck, I actually may have saved on or two of the letter regarding the prescription coverage because I took them in to show our local pharmacist and my doctor. I don't know how to prove to you about our premium increase except to tell you our coverage is under Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  I think the increase shows on my husband's end of the year information for his retirement that we file with the IRS.  I will say that I could use Indian Health Services through the tribe here but I quit using it about 38 years ago because both of us had insurance and my favorite doctor went into private practice. However, some of my prescriptions would not be available under the tribe's clinic because of their expense. Today, I paid out of pocket for two prescriptions $478.00. That is after what our insurance covers.  Every year for the past five or six years I have paid over $6,000. after insurance for my meds. True I report it on my taxes, but before Obamacare came along I paid much less.	0
SD: I fear you're correct.  Trump won the election with the support and counsel of the ultra-right..with Bannon in a leading role.  He depended on Bannon to be elected and there's a certain logic to depend on him now.  Trump has shown he's terrible ill-prepared for the tremendous responsibilities of the Presidency....this is no secret. In fact, for many voters, it was part of his appeal.    However, now he will have to govern....there's a big difference between telling folks how terrible things are and doing the hard work of making them any better.  Trump  made it quite clear during the campaign that he would target virtually every social and economic program developed during the Obama administration.  He's done nothing to make me feel otherwise.  I think we will see four years (if he lasts that long) of absolute chaos with Trump and his minions in charge.......I'm not optimistic....  Gary Crum	0
Remember the original plan was your dividend would be $50 a year based on residency. That was struck down as unfair. How is only giving the dividend to non-working people considered fair? In effect that is what Mr Havelock is asking us to believe. Get a check in October and if you have a job send it back in April. No Thanks. Sens and Reps do something. Grow a legislative pair and cut the PFD as one of your planks. Budget cuts, take back some oil giveaway. Call it a year. If it's not enough then next year look at a Sales tax that hits the million tourists that visit. No Income Tax while the state gives away money with the PFD. It's not based on need. It's based on fogging a mirror in state or whichever military base you live at now because you once fogged a mirror in Alaska.	0

Thanks — let me make sure you follow what Mr. Sklar is saying: These are revenues from plants in Canada AND Mexico, regardless of where the end customer is located.

"There is no monolithic ""media"".  There are thousands of news sources and they have a wide range of political/social perspectives in their editorial policies.  Most media outlets, IMO, do a good job separating their ""news"" from their ""opinion"" statements.  I think the RG is such a paper.  It is true that the majority of media outlets, just as it is true of the majority of Americans, disapprove of both the actions and persona Trump has demonstrated in his first three weeks in office.  They ""report"" his actions on the NEWS side.  They often 'criticize"" his actions on the EDITORIAL side.  This is called ""freedom of the press"" and is embodied in the First Amendment.  If you wish to only read ""approving"" editorials addressing President Trump and his actions, you're going to have to severely limit your sources....perhaps Breitbart and Fox News only..."	0

"Don't want to doubt McClung's sincerity, but Ithink there may be more to the story than meets our eyes. He is a victim of a faulty theology, as article notes, a product of the diocesan school system which skewered his understanding of the priority of Jesus.  It's about caring for the least ones, not discarded plaster of Paris statuary, Catholic kitsch, etc. Fortunately, in the deal he can house his business & probably uses the rectory as his home.  Not a bad deal for $150K. A drawing card for RCs who gladly fork over cash for kitsch rather than save desperate lives that need more than cosmetic touch ups.  To call it a museum of ""divine"" statues is an abomination. Inveighing plaster of Paris with divinity is sacrilegious. It reinforces RC critics who see RCs worshipping statues. Sadly, many RCs will provide cash while many are in desperate need, from the streets of Cleveland to the camps of South Sudan. Can't be worse, though, than the $62 M expended on the JPII white elephant in WDC!"	0

"In reading over all the debates both the city council and the state legislature are having on how to fund the Transit rail project in order to complete it and get it up and running.  The only option I see as being viable and palatable to everyone one involved is to ""leave the GE tax as it is, raise the TAT by a small percentage and to raise the property taxes in Honolulu by a small percentage; so that all told, you have a 3 streams of generating the necessary funding for rail.  What you end up with is a financial trickle down system, that comes from 3 separate sources, that help to finance rail, without breaking the backs of Honolulu's taxpayers.  Not to mention that all these sources of income generation can have sunset clauses once rail funding is no longer needed.  Maintenance funding is the City's problem to deal with, once it is up and running."	0

Canada doesn't need to export tarsands to China to remain one of the most prosperous countries in the world. There is no need for us to increase our production of fossil fuels, our domestic supply is more than adequate to meet all of our foreseeable requirements (which are actually declining). It is greed alone that drives the expansion of pipelines.   As for alternative fuels we have a variety of biofuels and a stable and ample domestic supply of fossil fuels for heating and transportation.  For baseload electricity generation we have hydro and geothermal, supplemented by wind and solar power.    There is no shortage of innovation, proven technologies or even a sound business case to implement alternative fuel and energy technologies. What we lack is the political will to break away from our dependency on the the oil industry.	0

It's because it's game over for abusive RE investors (many newcomers) buying houses and saying its a primary residence when it isn't to avoid taxes, and not rent out because that would be more obvious that it's not primary residence. Bill doesn't want more people to get into fraudulent dealings, and doesn't want to tip off people that are avoiding taxes, as to make sure government can recuperate those tax revenues cost-effectively.  But the real problem is our excessive immigration! which is excessive demand for housing distorting the market, way too many newcomers over the last couple of decades, but especially since the 2008 crisis. Not to mention too many skilled TFWs that aren't being required by employers to transfer their skills to Canadians and then being sent back.

Vouchers only provide a level playing field if any school that accepts vouchers takes those vouchers as full and complete payment with no strings attached - no required parental participation hours etc.  I do not want vouchers to subsidize the upper middle class and leave the poor behind.  So - vouchers must be taken as 100% payment if vouchers are accepted.  No exceptions.  You cannot add personal money to the value of a voucher.  I might support vouchers under those circumstances.	0

The editorial rightly credits the work of Chretien, Martin AND HARPER with getting the deficit under control.  (I would also have mentioned that Harper was able to get the federal tax burden down to its lowest level as a % of GDP in over 50 years.)  Increasing the national debt by 25% in a decade of government and in a necessary response to the greatest global recession since The Great Depression is not crippling to government finances.    Increasing the national debt by over 100% in 8 years as Obama did in the US is more of a problem.  Increasing the national debt by over 800% as Trudeau 1.0 did is and was crippling to our finances.  Without Mulroney's couragous but politically toxic trade and tax reforms on the revenue side and Chretien, Martin and Harper's discipline on the spending side, Canada today would Greece with mittens.  At the time, the only problem the Liberals and NDP had with the Harper deficit was that it wasn't as big as they wanted.  Thanks for the laughs, Cassie.	0

A real shame that folks in their 90s are blaming someone else for their problem.  Everyone likes a nice view.  Build near the water and blame the government when your house gets washed away.  Clearly, if the State or Mat-Su was responsible these folks would have successfully sued them long ago.  I am tired of seeing tax money go to fixed waterfront property (I think Hurricane Sandy resulted in $60 - $70 billion in Fed dollars to fix destroyed infrastructure in places that should never have been developed).  You certainly can feel for these folks but they should have moved the house long ago.	0

"Very good point about legitimizing alt fact/alt media means there is no truth anywhere, only political spin, opinion.  Even science is now just opinion, and what the non-scientist understands as scientific truth is to be given as much respect/belief as what the scientist discovers and reports.    If the news media wants to be respected again, they have to stop looking for the dramatic moment, the gochas, running news shows like episodes of ""You're fired"".  More, the national media desperately need to recognize that not all news is Washington politics.  One more, the news media needs to redevelop some respect for actually seeking and reporting facts.

I no longer work in the oil business, and have dis-invested totally, so I no longer make any money from the oil business. So your argument, as ad hominem as it is, doesn't apply.

One area where Soviet medicine is way ahead of Western medicine is in the area of phage therapy.  Bacterio phages are viruses that (only) infect bacteria.  They gained some popularity in the west when they were discovered in the late 19th century and in the early part of the 20th century, but soon fell out of use when antibiotics were discovered.  In some Soviet countries (primarily Georgia), phages have stayed in common usage, and can be bought over the counter to treat things like skin infections and dysentery.  Now, with antibiotic resistance becoming a serious problem, it's time western medicine gave phages another look.  They are extremely safe (because they can only infect specific species of bacteria), and apparently quite ubiquitous in the environment and easy to isolate.	0

In Asia you must bring your partner to the front desk where her ID is surrendered and a face photo is taken. If she has a history of being a trouble-maker she will be refused entry. We should do this here. Legalize prostitution and license everyone in the sex trade. Get their faces, health checkup records, and criminal histories on computer files. Weed out the stinkers and keep the one high on customer satisfaction. Personally I would like to see this guy get 3 months probation and if he stays out of trouble his murder record should be wiped clean.

I sometimes read comments from G&M posters who seem to think that throwing more public money at addiction problems will miraculously cure every single addict out there. Let this essay be an eye opener for them. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.  In other words, addicts recover if and when they've developed an authentic desire to recover - and not beforehand. I do think it's important, however, to fully support harm reduction tactics (such as safe injection sites).	0

Not a farmer, but I have some thoughts on this.   Maintenance costs shouldn't be much more than a regular farm's cost, acre per acre (though remember that each acre in this farm needs to be multiplied by the number of layers). Tractors need to be maintained, as do irrigation systems, and LEDs tend to run for hundreds of thousands of hours before needing swapping. Electrical costs will be increased (for the lights), but that may be recouped with solar panels on the roof (ironic: using the sun to power the lights that feed the plants, but you can convert green light into red and blue light which plants can photosynthesize from.)   The savings from avoiding pests and diseases spreading into your farm, and preventing hailstorms from damaging your yield, will be substantial. I'm not sure they will exceed the increased costs for the farming method, but that's part of what this project will demo. And year-round farming will help even more.   Looking forward to seeing how this works.	0
This has been mentioned before but bears repeating, First Nations should have established their own inquiry and therefore would have been able to structure it they way they wanted. Government could have played a secondary role in providing necessary documents, and funding where needed , although not a blank cheque. What is happening now should have been foreseen by both aboriginal leaders and government officials, and should have never been allowed to get this far. Certainly at this juncture it seems clear that it was not fully understood what the inquiry's mandate and format was. In this regard both government and First nations leaders must shoulder the blame.	0

Last year Forbes did their yearly list of the richest people .  While Trump maintains his brand name makes things worth more ( which it does ) and feels his worth is at around 7 to 10 Billion , Forbes thinks it's closer to 4 or 5 Billion.   I don't know about you but when I travel I often see Trump buildings .  For a person to be worth even 1 Billion says something about their ability to get things done.   If he can do for America just half what he has done for himself ,  America will become great again.   Every attorney worth a nickel would tell their client not to show their tax returns while under audit .  Trump would be dumb to do it.  Democrats think once they see them it will show pay-offs and kick-backs .  Like every smart person lists them.

I found De Gaulle one of the most detestable politicians of my lifetime.  He was intensely disliked by the Allied commanders during the Second World War.  His arrogance knew no bounds. The only thing the article did not mention was that Prime Minister Lester Pearson cancelled the rest of De Gaulle's trip to Canada after the famous speech and told him he was no longer welcome.  I still remember the picture of De Gaulle walking towards his plane to leave Canada.  The humiliation of being kicked out of a country he regarded as inferior must have been a very difficult. Canadians of the day were appalled at De Gaulle's meddling in Canada's internal politics and completely supported Prime Minister Pearson.	0
Nonsense. The Harper Conservative connection is undeniable. After the CPC loss in 2015, more than 30 of those now unemployed backroom boys and girls came West to work for the BC Liberals.

"Trudeau of course has little memory of his own actions. Shortly after the election he was over in Europe, where he coined the phrase. ""Canada is back "". This was seized upon immediately by the media , as the implication couldn't be clearer. After ten years in the wilderness the voters had returned the Liberals to power, and their arrogance shone through. The Liberals were Canadian and had a lock on Canadian values, and the Conservatives weren't and so were the people who voted for them. Similar sentiments were expressed by Trudeau in London. The phrase was dropped after much ridicule and more then a little commentary on how even after being away from government, the Liberals clung to their Toronto elitism and arrogant ways. Trudeau took our election results and used it denigrate those who hadn't voted Liberal. it was done outside the country, creating speculation as to what exactly had happened in our country that was so bad. Look at yourselves Liberals , before shifting blame."	0

A raid by government forces in Bahrain against a pro-opposition stronghold has left at least five people dead and hundreds detained in one of the deadliest crackdowns since protests erupted in 2011 against the Persian Gulf nation’s Western-backed monarchy.  The timing of the raid was striking, coming two days after President Trump publicly assured the king of Bahrain that their relationship would be free of the kind of “strain” that had occurred in the past — an apparent reference to the Obama administration’s periodic chiding of Bahrain over its human rights violations.	0

"The whole concept of ""tax fairness"" is something of a joke. We have a progressive income tax system which taxes higher income individuals at a higher rate than those with lesser incomes. That's why 50% of the taxes are paid by the top 10% of tax earners as per Stascan. The other 90% are tax subsidized. It about time we recognized this fact. For the record I support the progressive tax system so long as it is competitive with over nations, and with this government it is not.  As for civil servants  - something has be done as the liabilities are overwhelming for the tax payer. It is not to suggest that civil servants are lazy good for nothing as some people have suggested, I have worked with civil servants and I generally find them helpful.  There are simply too many of them and benefits accruing to them run in the trillions. Unfortunately the Ontario and now Federal Liberals have seen fit to try to buy their votes."	0

Sorry Dennis but it is very clear to me that you don't understand this industry. There are managers who out perform the market over the long term. But these people don't generally invest for the retail clients. Institutional clients are more demanding and managers have to outperform the market. They get paid what the market determines. Your opinion means nothing. Another comment of yours is  that institutional investors like that of Teachers would except poor performance from a CEO. The CEOs who makes the head of Ontario teachers look bad for investing in that firm would have his head handed to him on a patter. Teachers has the characteristics of a greedy capitalist robber baron.   Yes there are people I feel have made too much money. Some hedge fund managers in the US made 1 billion in income.

Of course not. You have simply been convinced by the lies propagated in the media. We can simply have more Canadian babies! we can encourage this. We need to help Canadian entrepreneurs first, Canadians are very good with ideas. We are already over-skilled and we have a skills gain. We need to use the people we have productively first and foremost! To save for retirement we can also set up solutions like sovereign wealth funds. People are working more years than they used to as well, so less retirement years. Also, Canada is too much of a job shop for foreign companies that do little reinvestment and have little commitment to Canada or their employees, that's something else we need to address so that we have more pro-Canadian policies and not let foreign companies acquire important Canadian companies.	0

immigration tends to raise GDP per capita. Which is good for Canada's and individual business' GDP/growth but it does NOT increase the wealth and standard of living of individual Canadians. If immigration really made individual Canadians wealthier then countries like Japan or Korea wouldn't exist. Both have large economies and wealthy citizens but next to no immigration. Doubly so for Japan, japan's GDP is stagnant yet its quality of life and individual wealth is not dropping- japanese are wealthy with a very high standard of living!  Immigration for the sake of GDP growth merely puts additional pressures on regional services, the environment and existing infrastructure (think congesrion). The planet is finite, pilling more people into a certain geographic area aimply means the tranches of the pie get thinner for those that live there, even if the nation' s GDP /pie gets somewhat larger.  GDP is a poor measure of quality of life. It would behoove the globe to make the distinction.	0

The two Great Commandments are not an evolution as you call it they are a summary of the Ten Commandments.

Why buy out your lease?  You would be wise to lease a new one or buy a certified pre-owned one...it would cost you less.

You now have to pay the taxes on the buy out as well.  If you shop...I am willing to bet you could get a certified pre-owned for less money when you factor in the safety and taxes not including future repair bills as the vehicle is older...just my two cents.	0

"[cont'd] high-rises to be built next to high-pressure pipelines.   Section 3.0 of the Provincial Policy Statement is very clear regarding public safety: ""Development shall be directed away from areas of natural or human-made hazards where there is an unacceptable risk to public health or safety or of property damage, and not create new or aggravate existing hazards.”  Compliance with the PPS is not optional, but since there's no enforcement mechanism the practice continues: the latest example is a 28-storey apartment that's been placed next to five pipelines, all of which carry refined products (mostly gasoline) at pressures in excess of 1,000 psi.   TSSA is the provincial regulator for pipelines. It has a minimum setback of 200 metres for ""institutions where rapid evacuation may be difficult...."" The new apartment building is less than 50 metres from the pipelines.   Ontario has sensible safety requirements but City planners seem very willing to ignore them. This needs to change."	0

Dave titles his screed “Economy takes a breather”. This isn’t reporting, but forecasting, as it suggests that there will be a return to meaningful growth in August. Maybe so, but the growth rates for the last three months have been 0.6%, 0.3% and 0.0%. It’s not an encouraging sequence. August saw the worst forest fires in British Columbia history and it was a disastrous month for real estate sales in the Greater Toronto Area so there is already some reason to believe that August will not be a banner month for growth.	0

It's true, the math works out that on average public transit pollutes more per passenger mile than private automobiles. Think about it: an 18-ton bus has to accelerate and stop to pick up and drop off each and every passenger, and often carries only a handful of passengers during off-peak hours.  It's also works out that bicycling is also worst for the environment! It takes far more resources to produce food calories than other fuels... for example, raising cattle uses 15,000 liters of fresh water per kilogram of beef produced, and produces 27 kilograms of CO2 for each kilogram of beef. When all the math is done, converting calories of food intake to miles cycled, and assuming a typical diet of foods, cycling is worst than driving!  However, there are other reasons to cycle and use buses, such as health, cost, congestion, etc.	0

The question of whether the Russians attempted to influence the election is clear enough to the FBI to state it clearly today. They said the Russians attempted primarily to hurt Hillary, but as Trump became her opponent they sought to help Trump. They made clear that there is an active criminal investigation going on against the Trump campaign for a crime involved with the Russian cyber attack on the US election. Both Comey of the FBI and Admiral Rogers of the National Security Agency refuted any eavesdropping or surveillance of Trump by the USA or Great Britain as claimed by Trump.	0

Here's a few fact for you, first hand.  I grew up in coal country WV.  Coal has been a dying industry since the Steel industry left Pittsburgh 40 years ago.  The Power industry has and is continuing to switch to natural gas, produced in these same WV hills.  Gas is cleaner, less damaging to equipment and no slag.  Those miners, some of them my friends and classmates in HS, who did not get a new career in the gas production industry, claimed disability or moved away.  I remember almost all the small streams leading to the Monongahela River running rust orange because the mines dumped there waste rock in the valleys below the mines, now they can do it again. Coal Cos. are like oil companies, the big dogs dig first then sell to the little bottom feeders (think Hilcorp in oil) after the coal seam is played out, the little dog bankTrumps so they wont have to pay clean up bills. Trump saved no jobs.	0

That's a pretty fantastic idea, that a simple amendment could nullify the whole Constitution and dissolve the Union, and the likelihood of such a bill ever being introduced and passed by Congress, let alone adopted by three-quarters of the states, is pretty remote.

Presidential lies are not inconsequential, even about something trivial, because what's the point?  There is no reason, can be no excuse, for lying about matters which are crucial to government & the American people.  Trump's words seem to have no connection to reality; he will state a lie in violation to visual evidence, and stonewall any opposition.  Trump knows little about governing, and because of his overwhelming vanity he can be manipulated by his advisors (whom we did NOT elect) into destroying the country.  Steve Bannon gathers more power daily, and from his remarks he would be fine with a dictatorship.	0

"You're pig wrassling,  and that gets you in the mud,  on their level,  and they are comfortable there.   When the majority realizes that,  perhaps there can be a solution.  ""Free"",  as a material value,  service value,  means it is worth nothing.  No monetary value.  As such,  ""free"" stuff, things,  are disposable, easily discarded,  and are easily replaced.  But if you have to actually work to get what you want,  in fact buying it with your own return for labor,  the material or service has incurred value,  and is respected as such.  That is why  people get so damned mad when something is stolen from them.  They are invested.  But ""free"" stuff is worthless,  and it is a shame so much taxpayer earned money,  given or taken by government,  is then given ""free"" to people who are not in any way interested in being invested by labor or effort in acquiring that material or service.  They feel entitled to sleep, pee,  where they want,  in ""freedom.""  Suckers work and pay taxes."	1

One way that the police could regain the people's trust would be for the good cops (the vast majority, I hope) to find the courage to report and testify against the ones who commit crimes. As long as they are willing to ignore police misbehavior in the quest for solidarity within their group, people will see that they place themselves above the law.  While they continue to be a closed group willing to harbor criminals within their ranks, the people have a real reason to fear the force.	0

"Aristotle and other political scientists have used terms to depict the forms of rule and authority.

With the incoming administration of Trump, Tillerson, Sessions, Bannon, et al., we're observing the dawn of a new historical phenomenon which may be appropriately labeled wackocracy."	0

Allow me to make an outrageous suggestion. The DA needs to regroup under the (very) interim leadership of Helen Zille even if this means losing a big chunk of electoral support and their tenuous hold on some of the metros. I choose HZ not because she is someone who is particularly politically savvy BUT she is the best that they have got. A scary reality! If they stick with MM they are going to shrink to a far greater extent than they will if they reinstate Zille.  As regards the DAs tenuous hold on some of the metros, this has created the mistaken belief within some of the rats and mice parties that they actually have real political relevance. Think EFF and UDM. They do not BUT they will make coherent government impossible through their actions.	0

The other problem with Trudeau's approach, besides the deficits, is the persistent tax risk.  He has threatened (either explicitly or implicitly through significantly delayed responses to taxpayer concerns) to create or raise myriad taxes through this ominous tax code review.  Health benefits, capital gains, eligible and non-eligible dividends, retained earnings, employee stock options, etc.  Yes some of these have since been (temporarily) ruled out,  but investors and businesses still face elevated tax risk under Trudeau.  And we shouldn't be fooled with the deferral of tax increases in the 2017 budget.  With material deficits for the foreseeable future and interest rates with but one direction to go (up), those tax increases and/or service cuts  are coming at some point down the line.  By cuts, I'm referring to essential service cuts that the average citizen would notice, over above cutting government bloat/waste that we know exists.  Let's start reducing the bloat sooner than later.	0

Because black workers are more closely scrutinized, it increases the chances that errors—large or small—will be caught. According to the researchers it’s more likely that a black employee would be let go for these errors than a white one. Thus another way of looking at the findings, Lang says, is that blacks simply don’t get a second chance.  Once fired, black workers return to the pool of unemployed—where they will once again have a difficult time finding work, prompting their next employer to be wary as well.  In the meantime, white workers are less scrutinized, and as a result, they enjoy a longer tenure on the job, which leads to a stronger work history, more skills, and higher wages.	0

"Note that the elected Student Union voted in favour of the motion Ms Khan tabled to not celebrate Canada 150 in support of aboriginal Canadians.  Perhaps her use of expletives wasn't called for (or maybe, in context, it was) but I don't see what was racist about her post or hashtags.  She wasn't addressing white people, she was addressing people who disagreed with her motion.  The term ""white fragility"" isn't racist.  It just names a very real tendency of some people to take offense at any attempt to address the racism that aboriginals and people of colour have faced historically, and still do face.  Indeed, presumably some of the Student Union members who agreed with Ms Khan's motion would be considered white.  I think the University was stupid to involve themselves in the political debate.  They should have just asked her to apologize for swearing."	1

They also told us that Mefloquin was readily available and easy to acquire while they were low on stock of the other medications and could not promise that we would have a constant supply.  The only side effect they told us of was that we would likely experience vivid and very active dreams.  Looking back it sounds scary, but at the time it sounded pretty cool.  This is how we were sold on Mefloquin.	0

"As any Rockies fan can attest, this franchise has provided some truly breath taking pitching performances throughout the years.  My personal favorite, prior to this weekend, was the Jamie Moyer experiment a few years ago (he of the Stanton gopher ball that knocked out the Miami scoreboard lights, among the many other ""highlights"" of his time with the Rockies).  However, coming on the heels of the fine eight walk (in 21 batters) effort provided by current number one starter Mr. Chatwood on Saturday, we come to the very definition of what fans have come to expect from Rockies pitching.  In a performance likely not seen since the unfortunate meltdown that ended Rick Ankiel's pitching career, we have Mr. Ottavino's Sunday matinee. Clinging to a two run lead, he uncorks two wild pitches (in a matter of a few seconds) gifting the Dodgers three runs (and perhaps the turning point of the Rockies 2017 season) without even requiring them to put the ball in play.

That is true this time, but that doesn't mean it will be the case every election.  In 2013 they got 48% vs. 49% for BC Liberals + BC Conservatives.  In 2009 it was 50% vs. BC Liberals 46% while in 2005 51% vs. BC Liberals 46%.  The BC Liberals had been in power for 16 years so the desire for change was strong while the BC Conservatives were a joke so those two meant the right wing vote was going to be lower than normal.  Likewise in 2001 the BC Liberals got 58% and if you include the Unity Party it was 61% but that was another change election and the right wing vote hasn't matched that since.  Now if the BC Liberals hang on the left wing vote will probably be higher next time around while if they don't it will probably be lower although not necessarily a loss.	0

There is something sad and yet undeniably appropriate that the first wave of casualties under Trump's war against progressive, socially responsible government should come from the voting block that put him over the top. Sad because they are overwhelmingly the uneducated, unemployed, underprivileged members of American society. Appropriate because those who lash out in anger and ignorance against a system they see as imperfect should accept responsibility for replacing it with a far more imperfect one.   Hopefully the childish delight and smug satisfaction with their decision to elect the most avaricious, untrustworthy, self-absorbed, incompetent leader in American history will sustain them through the dark times ahead. Think on it, dwell on it as your hero pulls out from under you every social safety net compassionate, conscientious Americans fought so hard to win for you these past decades.   My sympathies are with the children who bear the brunt of such hubristic folly.	1

What Patkotak can know, and chooses to ignore (ergo, the use of the word ""lie"" above) is that blacks are incarcerated at disproportionate rates because they commit disproportionate amount of the crime: Despite making up just 13% of the population, blacks committed half of homicides in the United States for nearly 30 years: http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf  Since males make up 90% of those in jail- is our justice system sexist against males?

"""For our journalists, reading through comments was the equivalent of a random person off the street walking into an office worker’s cubicle and spewing profanity at them through a megaphone.""  Let me guess: the above was probably the main reason for stopping the comments previously. Journos were used to their comfy little echo chambers. In the past, pontificating and spewing the Party line (deliberate capital P) used to be nice and safe one-way traffic, with the journalists imagining that the enforced silence of the public - limited only to censored letters to the editor - meant that they were not only immune from criticism, but also could fantasize that the public agreed with what they wrote.   The internet comments changed all this.  When what a journalist writes is subject to instant criticism, it becomes a lot more difficult for those with fragile little egos, whose ""journalism"" means repeating the standard left-wing platitudes, to accept that they are usually wrong."	0

Rick  I would not expect a Catagreement on that one anytime soon.   While ENB remains my largest holding (but only marginally), I still added to my positon a wee bit on the close on Friday. Not enough that it is a big bet.   My data shows that the market is somewhat extended here and that sentiment is a bit too bullish.   I have zero doubt that the long term trend remains solidly bullish as the sources I use----those with solid records over many decades continue to show based on proven statistical analysis (supply / demand.) That data shows that the next 1 - 3 years are, based on current information, very likely to provide higher share prices. In the short term however, investor sentiment overall (Cat excluded) has become somewhat frothy / too optimistic and a 5% to 10% correction would be no surprise.   I'm actually hoping for this correction (aka opportunity) as I suspect from your comments, you are too. We win if it happens. We win if it does not. Normal people can live with that	0
Seeking a weekend break from his campaign rallies, Donald Trump jetted to his yacht, which was docked off the coast of Italy. He invited Pope Francis and the press corps on board for a Saturday afternoon cruise. It was a rather windy day. The Pope's little hat, his zucchetto, was blown from his head and into the water. A crewman began lowering a boat to retrieve the zucchetto. Trump told the crewman not to bother. Trump climbed down the yacht's ladder; walked across the waves, picked up the zucchetto; walked back to the yacht and handed it to the Pope. The Pope and the press corps were amazed! Donald Trump could actually walk on water! Speculation immediately began as to how ABC, CNN, NBC, The Washington Post and New York Times would report this miraculous event to the rest of the world.

The Chickasaw Nation sided with the confederates, and fought for the south in the civil war. Curious how liberals never call us racists, just white people. The shameless intellectual bankruptcy is staggering.	0

The myth about cats being good rodent control has been disproved on every island where cats were imported to take care of the imported rodents. Hundreds of years later and there's nothing but a thriving population of cats and rodents -- all the native wildlife on those islands now either extinct or on the brink of extinction -- even those native species which are better rodent predators than cats (such as many reptiles and shrews which destroy rodents right in their nests), the cats having destroyed them directly or indirectly.  The rodents reproduce in burrows and holes out of the reach of cats, where they are happy to reproduce forever to entertain cats the rest of their lives, and make your own lives miserable, on into infinity. On top of that, when cats infect rodents with cat's Toxoplasma gondii parasite, this hijacks the minds of rodents to make the rodents attracted to where cats urinate. http://scitizen.com/neuroscience/parasite-hijacks-the-mind-of-its-host_a-23-509.html	0

It is disgusting and shameful that Trump has not denounced the Russians' interference in the election. Anyone with a grade 6 education can realize that this fact alone, regardless of what impact the interference had, is an international incident of incredible significance.  Trump only cares about himself. He needs serious psychological help.  Trump's bizarre response shows that he is not fit to be a class president, much less US president.	1

Contrary to Jay Bozievich’s opinion and as Lane County residents already know, the Lane County Commission’s proposed ordinance to interfere with the people’s initiative power is an outrageous and unconstitutional act of government overreach.   The smoke screen of saving county money is transparent. The bulk of the costs of elections are incurred because of required local, state, and/or federal issues alreading on the ballot. The additional cost of a county initiative vote is nominal.   The purported worry of the erosion of home rule authority masks the real fear that the people will write and pass laws that protect their health, safety, and welfare instead of corporate interests. The initiatives that Jay Bozievich is working so hard to stop would: 1) ban the aerial spraying of toxic herbicides in Lane County; 2) recognize the people’s right to establish their rights to health, safety, and welfare and ban harmful corporate activities that violate those rights; and 3) a ban on GMO use.	0
"I'm female, approaching my sixth decade, and I lift because my mother had severe osteoporosis. I do not want to be that frail old lady with the walker who breaks an ankle just standing up (yes, that really happened to her). I've been active all my life, including lifting weights off an on, mostly in winter. It paid off with my first bone density scan at age 50, which showed that my bone density was ""normal"" - by which they mean  ""like an average 30 year old"". It has quite likely gone down a bit in the last 9 years, but I lift very heavy weights and am very, very, strong for a woman of any age. Why not? I went to an automotive store last week and bought a car battery. I didn't need any help lifting it into the shopping cart and then into my van. Strength means independence for older women."	0

It's tough to be a private pilot here on the rock, when the rental pool consists of pos aircraft......45+ year old Beech and Piper, valued at $10k and $5k.  You can't even get a decent used car for that kind of money.  At least when the car breaks down, you pull off the road.  When the plane breaks down, you die.  Here's how this is going down.  Mueller writes off the loss....no way he insured those old crates.  He'll declare bankruptcy and hide assets in order to prevent losing everything due to the inevitable lawsuits coming his way.  The victims families can sue for millions and win, but get zero.  I'm assuming of course that both crashes were the result of a mechanical failure.

That's because you're a logical person who knows the consequences of actions.  A high percent of the public will sign a petition based on a verbal description of 'what it will do'.

"ad naseum: try looking at it like this. Someone is standing, contemplating jumping off a cliff. Someone else can say ""Hey, Don't do that!"" Once the person has jumped, it is too late to intervene; trying is just a waste of time.  To carry our analogy further, the jumper is part way down and yells: ""Help!"" What can the person who warned against the jump do then? This is where we are now in Alaska. There is going to be a big old splat, and it is the Democrats fault because they are the ones who jumped. Sorry, but those are just the facts.  Further, I worked basically for free for almost 8 years, not only trying to prevent this mess, but also helping implement 4 policy changes that will help us somewhat survive this mess.

Pierre, I believe that one of the pre-conditions for being granted a pardon, other than having been tried and convicted of an offence, is that the person being pardonned must make a full and detailed discloure of all his or her unlawful acts. This is a very important element. This as you well know is why an accused thief for example will ask for 2 or 3 other crimes to be taken into consideration at sentencing - he does not ant to do a stretch for stealing jewellery, only to be prosecuted again later for other crimes that the prosecuting authorities were not aware of at the time.  Please comment on the position and logic of the NPA OPPOSING the re-instatement of charges against Zuma. Surely this is the job of defence counsel, not the prosecuting authority? How many other matters does the NPA oppose and refuse to prosecute when private individuals, not ANC politicians are involved?  What were the reasons for opposing the re-instatment of charges, and is there any merit in them at all?	0
"Has anyone opining on this thread ever actually experienced chronic, INTRACTABLE pain?  Obviously not.  It is has been proven for a Very Long Time that patients receiving opiate therapy for pain RARELY become addicted to their medication.  What pain medicine does for people like this is enable them to function, have a better quality of life, take care of their families, work, etc.  Another very important point:  people in severe pain never get ""high"" from their medication.  Most importantly:  NONE of this will stop the true addicts from pursuing a fix.  Providing help is great - but there is already help for people who need it and WANT it.  The key word is ""WANT"" because no amount of legislation will change a person's mind unless they want to change it.  Every single prohibition type movement has failed.  This one will fail also.  All we will see is a spike in suicides by people who have been dumped by their doctors - and a great deal more pain."	0
Understood. Why is she prosecuting on the civil side and not on the criminal side? After all, there is no SOL on the criminal side but there is SOL on the civil side.

"Its refreshing to read a thoughtful commentary that tells it like it is, thank you Gov. Knowles for speaking out  on the dreadful performance of our current politicians, Board of Game and predator killers at ADF&G.  Sadly, the stewardship of Alaska's great wildlife has regressed to that of the mid-1800's in the lower 48.  Perhaps Alaska should modify its motto to read: ""The Last Frontier of Backward Thinking."" How did our wildlife stewardship get so bad? It was Frank Murkowski who stacked the Board of Game with special interest hunters, and guides, Sarah Palin who called for a bounty on wolves, Sean Parnell who sued the Federal government losing many times, and Bill Walker who has failed miserably to lead in protecting Denali wolves from a shameful slaughter. Its time for Alaska citizens to wake up and elect political leaders who will finally deal with our wildlife scandal. Vote For Wildlife this fall."	0

I used to be a teacher for a few years and if I were teaching poorly or acting idiotically then I would hope that someone (parent or student) would call me out on it.  Far too many teachers in Ontario, especially in the 1-12 grade range, are idiots who should not be teaching.  Unfortunately they are protected by a very strong labour organization which tries its very best to quash exceptional teaching abilities and techniques (regardless of the rhetoric on their respective websites).  Are there non-idiotic teachers?  There are definitely many but the ratio of idiots-to-others is much larger than it should be.	1
It's good that cities want to reduce pollutants, add green spaces and reduce vehicular traffic. Less CO emissions and more green space equals a healthier and happier population.

Subvert the will of the voters by not implementing the Nothwest expressway, force an EMX system and take away private businesses property, disrupt their ability to run their businesses and then throw more money at this endeavor.

"Ms. Adams, granted I am not a marine biologist, but I am a Ph.D. astrophysicist and I know my way around technical papers and how to contact the authors of those papers.  Have you read the referenced papers? I have and my statements are based on those readings.  As I keep writing, they are not applicable to the west-side beach because the geology is considerably different, and I confirmed this difference by contacting one of the authors.  They knew of no studies of beaches like the west-side beach.  As  for the trampled tidelands of the ""rocky shore"" variety studied in the papers, the studied trampling was much greater that what would be experienced at the west-side preserve.  Even then, one of the papers quoted nine months as a sufficient amount of time for the biological communities to recover.  Finally, the west-side beach is heavily affected by wave action during storms.  The resultant grinding of the upper tidelands is not condusive for macroscopic life - look at the beach."	0
"Could your skin be any thinner? Nenshi says in the article that it's not a Calgary thing or an Alberta thing. He points to examples in Quebec and Vancouver, but the guy who seems to want perpetuate the fragile Albertan stereotype says ""they're picking on me.""   At no point was it implied or stated that Alberta is more racist than any other place. Just that racism is an issue here and that there has been a rise in racism and Islamaphobia in recent years across Canada.  It's kind of poetically ironic that you're accusing him (falsely) of doing exactly what you're doing."	0

I don't that Morneau is inflexible on the whole.  But finance ministers throughout history tend to be very protective of their budgets.  Then Finance Minister Jim Flaherty continued to defend his budget in late 2008 even in the face of defeat in the House of Commons.  That led to Stephen Harper proroguing Parliament in order to avoid a vote on the budget that was sure to be defeated.  Only then could Flaherty stop defending the budget (because it no longer existed) and build a new budget that would be supported by the House of Commons.  Mr. Morneau is probably insistent on the budget passing as is because he wants the infrastructure bank to go into effect as soon as logistically possible as it forms a significant part of his economic plan.  Splitting it off from the budget for further discussion would lead to a delay that Mr. Morneau feels would be harmful to his projections and the economy.	0
Fr Reese has done a great job of outlining the change Pope Francis has initiated to swing the Church from it's traditional understanding of itself as the guardian of personal salvation to one that understands the Church's Gospel mandate is to serve others and care for the planet.  He understands what we do to each other and the Earth in the present has consequences for the future.  Kudos to Francis because this is a sorely needed switch in emphasis in a world that is regressing into a 'me first tribalism'.  I just wish he could grasp how the current priesthood as it's configured and as he supports it, is a counter witness to the rest of his papacy.  For all his complaints about clericalism, there has been no change in the core concepts that produce and encourage clericalism.  Hence the failure to promote justice for abuse victims and the lack of change in accountability streams.  One can not speak with authority on inclusion when at heart one practices institutional exclusion.	0
"Thus my point that he cannot fail to own it unless... (stated above).   If he erred in his interpretation of the pope's intent, he should take that correction.

Natalie, You offered a solution which is better then the people who only complained or blamed the emp,oyees. I may not necessarily agree with your suggestion because it would lead to a culture of distrust among the employees. My suggestion is to hold responsible the supervisors or the department heads. Personnel management is part of their duties and they need to keep a handle on who works over-time. They do the scheduling and they approve leave time. A policy and procedure for any over time should be developed or if they have one then they either need to revise it or pay attention to their department budgets.  That is why they get paid the big bucks !	0

From experience of communicating within our family, with young people, who have a sense of common, communal belonging, it seems clear that they are tiring of institutional church fighting over claims on 'truth'. If we are authentic, we seek to understand and commit to truth which speaks to us all in common as we relate in common in the order of nature; religion grounds in ecological belonging.	0

We were not wealthy but the public Schools in our area were pathetic,so our sons went to a private School. entrance Exam ensure only bright students got in and the kids knew that the school cost so they worked hard. great camraderie, all boys school,worth the money. Several of the students were from homes where both parents taught in the Public System. How can a Teacher teach a class where many do not speak English,some have behavioural problems, some have challenges,the good kids just survive. And do not get me started on the Teachers in the Public System,many are incompetent seat warmers.	1
"Reporters would do well to find experts that- in my opinion- are fair and impartial. In my opinion Janek Mayer simply collects hundreds of thousands of public dollars to tell the Senate Majority whatever BS it wants to hear.  In a Sen. Resources hearing  on 4-16- 2015 Sen. Wielchowski elicits from Tsafos and Mayer that they have not filed financial disclosures with Alaska as is required by law.  Further- it appears that almost all their ""business"" is with the Senate majority- again, collecting our public dollars like pigs at a trough.   http://lba.akleg.gov/download/contracts/mayer/janak_mayer_contract_01-19-2015.pdf  It was the incompetent Senate, and incompetent ""advisers"" that lead the way with the disaster that is SB-138- a scheme to make the Alaska LNG project vastly more expensive than it needs to be, along a route that makes not a bit of sense."	0

I do believe that Americans will be able to come together after the election, if Hillary Clinton is elected President, and if Donald Trump will sink into the background and allow the country to heal. His words have been very divisive. Words have meaning and Hillary has shown that we are stronger together and that she can work across the isle to get things done for all Americans. President Obama wanted to do this too, but some in the Republican Party kept preventing a spirit of working together to happen. It is interesting to me to see that many Republicans are voting for Hillary to become our next President. That is a healthy sign and shows me that there are still Republicans who care about the art of compromise in order to get things done for the American people.	0
I thinks it's because they know Hillary's a crook that can be bought and loves big business. So simple if your head wasn't buried in the sand.	1
"""THEIR money"" has quite often come from destroying jobs.  If THEY were doing THEIR jobs well, we would have trade and budget surpluses. President's Clinton and Obama were not friends of workers.  Clinton signed off on unchaining the banks so they could speculate and fail at the public's expense, and Obama made sure they weren't prosecuted for their financial crimes.  And they both got huge ""speaking fees"" from these destroyers of jobs."	0

"I agree.

Obama, courageously, tried to change that course of history. And to quote Zbigniew Brzezinski on Obama's failed foreign policy objectives is beyond the pale. This is the madman who helped create the Taliban, and brags about it today. He also wants to destroy Russia, at any cost. There are other models to pursue in geopolitics.

I have reflected on the concerns raised in this article.  I note that your friend provided gifts of quality over the years you knew her.  Art created by her specifically for you.  This suggests closeness and connectedness, a person you greatly admired, and who appreciated your admiration, perhaps expecting it.  Perhaps she was the talker and you were the listener.  Your contributions to conversation may have been interrupted or cut short.  Woe betide if you disagreed with her.  Years of this can build resentment.  A friend such as this, who one thought to be profound, can be grating over the years.  Such a person such forces one to expand their own friendship network, and can inevitably contribute to its' demise.  It takes a while to recover such a loss and then the epiphany sets in when you realize you have an appreciated voice beyond playing second fiddle.  Never fear chance encounters.  Be genuine.  Your article published in one of Canada's great newspapers is the ultimate gotcha.	0

@Doug Saunders: What is the value of your personal real estate holdings? Sorry if I missed it in the article. If someone has 6-7 figure holdings in a given asset type and then writes commentary related to it, they should disclose this in my opinion.  Also my opinion: policies related to cheap debt and immigration, before anything else, are key drivers of high prices. These factors are facilitated by our governments and these governments are supported by just enough of those born early enough to make lots of $ from this system. Other topics related to real estate affordability - including density - are secondary.  Condo living? If it works for you, great. Many young people with somewhat-in-demand skills don't have to settle for that. Massive tolls, user fees, and tax spikes await those who drive away young essential skills and the future tax base.   Wind back the many government interventions in favor of high prices and we wouldn't be talking about raising kids in condos.	0

"Apprenticeship programs start with a minimum wage and as the apprentice masters each level the wage goes up, this happens for the apprentice regardless if s/he is 17 years old or 50 years old.  If $15.00 an hour is the going wage for the apprenticeship level, the apprentice's age should not factor against her/him.       Also, every apprentice requires the supervision of a journeyman while learning, the journeyman ""babysits"" the apprentice regardless if the apprentice is 17 or 50.       Vocational arts programs helped many in my generation go into professions that allowed them to live well and save for retirement.  These are jobs that cannot be outsourced like many of the mill and manufacturing jobs have.         Some students don't have the capabilities to tackle a university education but do have the capabilities to masterfully become a journeyman trades person.  If we are going to spend money on college prep courses, we need to also spend money on vocational arts courses, too."	0

Wow, where did you acquire such a conspiratorial view of history? In 1774, when the Quebec Act stipulated the continuation of French culture and institutions in the relatively newly acquired (1763) colony of Quebec, the British were facing increasingly restless American colonists. Thus, the British sought to mollify French-speaking Quebec to solidify its loyalty and preclude it allying with the English-speaking American colonists. It had nothing to do with later developments whereby the French language and institutions were rendered secondary outside of Quebec (proper) more as functions of changing demographics and associated power dynamics, particularly following the post American Revolution migration of English-speaking Loyalists into what are now Ontario and the Maritime provinces, than anything else. There was no grand plan in 1774 to suppress Quebec's or Canada's French character, although by the time of Lord Durham's 1838 report the situation had changed due to demographics.	0

JodySoCal,  In my humble opinion, both sides on the WO issue have lost sight of the mission purpose God gave us, seeking our own salvation and ministering God's redeeming love and transforming power so others can be saved. All the arguing and blaming each other is a symptom of individuals having lost their spiritual purpose for existence and becoming disconnected from the power of God when we should instead be continually seeking more of His indwelling presence and power. When we are doing that is when we see Him working with such love and power that all the arguments on topics like WO become a total waste of words because we will be following Him instead of drawing limits on how we think He will or will not work.  God is waiting patiently for us to draw closer to Him and begin using the power He has promised so we can each become ministers of redemption, regardless of gender and in the limitless list of ways He wants.	0

It's a sad fact but our mothers were convinced years ago that their sons risked brain damage if they played this uniquely American sport.  But that evades the issue posited by Obama's hapless dupe, Kaepernick.  Kneeling, standing, one after the other, whatever -- they're all political statements. The NFL, now realizing it shot itself in the foot, is walking the issue back. For most of us, these millionaires are free to protest because they enjoy the same freedoms as everyone else. But they have no such right to do it on their employer's property and certainly not on my time. If rich radicals want to spit on the flag, they should get their own TV show and do it there. They won't because few will buy what they're selling. By the way, the NFL isn't compelled to play the anthem or display the flag. They do it because it sells their product.

"""Down the memory hole"" Dejain, Back to a previous letter--   you'll recall a recent letter which we both commented on, ""With 23 other letters to choose from, why did the Legislature pick the one letter that is identified with the male chromosome? Fred M."" As you pointed out, FM was wrong about the XY chromosome, and I raised the question of why the RG would print such an inaccurate  letter with so many to chose from. (And Motley brought up a typically  sarcastic comment) Well, guess what, Dejain?  Try finding FM's letter and our comments on line-- they seem to be  gone!   I guess we've been scrubbed.  So while the print edition will still have FM's strange letter  attacking our state legislature as long as the newsprint  lasts, history may never see it  or our corrections  if  it's been censored out of the electronic version. Reminds me of ""1984"", down the memory hole.   (Dejain, i'm curious as to why  the RG would do a thing like that, and if it's done it before.  Any thoughts?)"	0

"What the judgement condemns is the high-handedness of the government's action in not consulting with the bands themselves as to the best way to proceed with helping the children, e.g. it proceeded unilaterally and left all the FN people involved in the dark as to what would happen to the children.   In that I can only agree. They were under the impression they would be returned soon, but they just ""disappeared"" with no explanation as to what had happened to them. Some were sent to the US in exchange for payment, there seems to have been little oversight or selection of foster parents, etc. A botched job.  Some of that can be attributed to what is common in any government action and particularly in times past, i.e. high-handedness, no consultation, paternalistic assumptions about knowing best, etc. Also attitudes to adoption were different, secrecy and closed adoptions were the norm, etc. Nothing specific to FN. A lot has changed in adoption practices since then."	0

"This reminds me of Paul Harvey ""The Rest of the Story"", the city put a two cent tax on gas for road repairs, then they put another three cents on, then they said it was not enough and so was going to be used someplace else, where?, The bonds and what you see now took along time to come through.  What about the five cent tax on bags that Kitty wanted?  Is the money be collected? from what I learned it is not.  If it is being collected, how much and what is it being use for?  I do see a lot of people walking out of stores, goods in hand, no bags.  Will not pay five cent for a bag, no wonder the city tax the gas.  Forget political parties, local, state, federal all the same, they like to tax, waste the money, there is no management no matter what level your talking about.

Saunders hasn't produced a comprehensive plan for single-payer health care because he hasn't figured out how much it will cost, how to pay for it, or how to transition from private insurers to single payer.

It is not New Testament scholars, it is some New Testament scholars, apparently the ones you read and/or favor.  Origen wrote of Hebrews: “If I were asked my personal opinion, I would say that the matter is the Apostle's but the phraseology and construction are those of someone who remembered the Apostle's teaching and wrote his own interpretation of what his master had said. So if any church regards this epistle as Paul's, it should be commended for so doing, for the primitive Church had every justification for handing it down as his.”  The content is certainly Paul’s.	0

The New York Times liberal hit team is at it again. I had hoped that the new ADN publishers would understand that their circulation would improve if they would end the one sided Times and Washington Post biased reporting and provide a more balance newspaper.

He has recused himself from anything that in the slightest way involve his holdings or  investments. Yet the Times twists things to make it look like he is hiding something. Where is the evidence that he is using his position to benefit himself? Or where is it that he did not fully disclose his holdings and there sources?	0

Karl Schroeder - another way to look at it ... the right way to look at it ...  All taxation is theft. The mortgage deduction allows those who choose to own homes but remain in debt for them to deduct the interest on their primary residence (no second homes are covered, ever).  What that means for people in my income bracket (we're right around the national average of $52,000) is a savings on the tax theft of $3800 on a modest 3-bedroom house. That money gets spent on other important items, like food and electricity.  Now, take a good look around at your neighbors (if you live somewhere where people own their homes). How many of your neighbors do you want to see forced to sell their homes and move into apartment blocks ... or rent their homes from super wealthy people for whom the mortgage interest deduction is irrelevant.  Because that is actually what you are proposing, that you deny middle-class people the ability to own decent homes. Society without opt-outs is servitude.	0

The US is actively trying to reduce their tax rates in line with other OECD nations and bring back capital from abroad.   The large amounts of money on the corporate balance sheets are largely tech firms like Microsoft who have held large cash reserves  for decades because of the volatility of their business . Pease note unless you are a shareholder of Microsoft or one of the tech companies you do not have a say  how these tech firms operate.  No point in complaining about low corporate tax when your Liberal governments are giving billions to these same companies.   Lastly, not the 1% has not benefited but the .01% and that's largely a result of the low interest rate policies of the central governments. Assets like real estate and stocks are inversely proportional to interest rates so the Fed and BOC have made the Thompson family billions in additional wealth.	0

I think it is time for Mueller to step down and the Attorney General to appoint someone without political baggage to head the investigation.  Mueller's hiring of Democrat-donating attorneys to staff his team is just adding unnecessary and unwarranted baggage to the carousel.  For the sake of EVERYTHING this nation stands for, this investigation must be viewed by all sides as being truly independent of politics.  Here's a suggestion...Why not appoint a three-judge panel headed up by someone like Senior Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and two repected senior judges, one appointed by a Republican and one appointed by a Democrat, to lead the investigation.  No one should be on the staff that has made a political contribution to any party for at least the past decade.	0

Let's not forget that our (incompetent, lazy, unprofessional) police department closed the downtown rest rooms as well as several along the bike paths. Civilized cities have clean accessible public rest rooms. Yes, many of our homeless people aren't toilet trained, so we would need to hire monitors to clean up the facilities. However, those monitors would be cheaper than paying cops to just show up and chat, and we would have clean rest rooms for our money.  I've been here so long that I've gotten used to the squalor and am now amazed when I travel and come across public rest rooms that are clean and open. Once upon a time, that was the norm everywhere, including here.	1

Uhhh...so the Admiral would have balked if it instead had been Obama ordering immediate nuclear strikes on China?  Dumb question of course.  The real tone of the article is putting down China.  Australia sees itself as Asia's big player, because Australia is quite irrelevant everywhere else on Earth.  Although first in for the spoils, it always gets squeezed out by others like China, Taiwan, Korea, and U.S. as in, for example since the late 1980s South Vietnam.  Although Australia wrote the book on how to do business in Vietnam while ruling from its glorious $$$ perch on Ho Chi Minh City's (Saigon) Floating Hotel, Australia eventually got the book thrown at it and sent to the sidestreets of commerce.  China is the one at the top today that everybody would like to take down.	0

Its not easy being homeless if you don't want to be, many do, they rely on not being found so they can live a criminal life, others are the unlucky happenstance of not fitting in to society.

If you're gaining from this society its s good way to preserve it by helping those who can't. Its the role of whoever's in charge.

At what point is it going to dawn on people that Trump is just carrying on being Trump? Being president just gives him a bigger stage to Trump from. The tweets aren't some master plan, they are Trump reveling in his millions of followers. Pundits say that as president, Trump must learn that words have consequences. Is it not clear that Trump cares about only one thing, and that thing is self-aggrandizement? He keeps every magazine cover he appears on, regardless of the story. He was against outlawing CFCs to save the ozone layer because non-CFC hairspray didn't work as well. Now he tweets baseless accusations and forces his administration to burn through dwindling credibility like kindling backing it up. Trump is incapable of exiting his illusion of being smartest, most handsome, most knowledgeable man on earth. When the noise surrounding his collapsing presidency gets to bothersome, he fires off another few tweets and holds another rally, the better to bask in deserved adulation. Sad.	0

There is certainly no shortage of free speech from all corners of the right, from centrist Republicans and traditional Republicans to Libertarians to Tea Party radicals to alt-right fringe to the KKK and other White Nationalist movements. All of these factions are free to hold rallies, to peaceably assemble and to speak. And speak, and speak, and speak! In fact the speech of the right in all its variety isn't in the least repressed, rather it gushes nonstop from every medium, 24/7/365, like a broken firehose of opinion.

If you look at the ideological leanings of the current governments each of them sit to the right of our current government albeit to the left of the Harper government.

They are also more conservative in some ways as four of the five charge user fees for doctor's visits, 4 of the 5 have parallel private systems for health care, all of them have a lower corporate tax rate than Canada.  Also their taxes are lot flatter as the top marginal rate are only slightly higher, but middle incomes pay a lot more in taxes never mind they have a 25% VAT so our tax structure is actually more progressive.	0

The notion that the Church is going to ""accompany"" youth ...does strike me as a ""get in line issue""..     Parents who produced and nurtured this child from in Utero on up...who were critical in value formation, education. Faith sharing are very clearly in my mind..the guys who have a whole lot of ""Accompanying "" experience....  I have noted how often kids select careers that bear a resemblance to their parents...how often great personal sacrifice by parents has given kids career options that they might never have had....how parents values including stable marriages are reflected in their kids.....

I would guess parents know their kids will be getting mandatory English education for years and would like to pass of some tradition knowledge too. My Dad did not speak English when he first entered school. He eventually got two college degrees and rose to the top of his profession.

Pre-pre-preschool is a yuppy invention which has not been around long enough to prove it is all that necessary.

"I guess I'm in an unusual position as a liberal Catholic who loves both the Ordinary AND Extraordinary Forms of the Roman Rite.  Liturgical diversity is a bedrock of the Catholic tradition, and, as others have said, unity does not mean uniformity.  In response to Father Reese's contention that the Tridentine liturgy is still being allowed only because some people ""find change difficult,"" I ask him how he would explain the appeal of the Tridentine Mass and pre-Vatican II practices such as the Ember Days to someone (using myself as an example) who was born some time after the 1970 implementation of the reform and did not experience the Extraordinary Form until I was in my thirties?   Both the Pauline Mass and the Tridentine Mass are living liturgies.   Phasing out the latter is precisely the kind of small-minded authoritarianism about which liberal Catholics tend to complain when such authoritarianism (e.g., banning female altar servers) is carried out by conservative Catholics."	0

Hi Philip;  Thanks for the positive news. I've been loath of Sierra Club, Green Peace & the ecofascists for decades. The fascist EPA has been out of control since the Klinton years.  Admin Pruitt is correct re: CO2; it is NOT his opinion but a verifiable fact! Educate yourself. CO2 levels in the air are 0.04%! So, a 100% increase would bring it to what, hmm? When that arrogant & ignorant hag who ran EPA previously declared CO2 a hazardous substance, I lost my dinner! Yet, most of the sheeple yawned or applauded. Water vapor (clouds) has a 'yuge' green house effect - plants dig it. Methane comes next; forget the cows, though. Any active volcano spews daily more vapor & fumes of CO2, CH4, SO2, HCl, HF, etc. than global human activity per annum!  https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/of97-262/of97-262.html Lying Paul Ehrlich ('honest' in German!), along w/ UN & Swedish socialists, pushed the global cooling hysteria in the '70s!

Does anyone remember how the Chinese like to flood other countries with their people . At a mine near Tumbler Ridge they tried to force the acceptance of using only their laborer force with the feeble excuse that only Chinese labor were experienced using the type of mining method proposed for the mine. when this was exposed as a lie the Chinese company had an employee try to bring a court case claiming discrimination which did not work at the time.  The only way to do business with China is to keep them on a short lease and keep their labour force out of Canada	0

Harper lacked the will, the work effort, the ability, the imagination, and the desire to reform the Senate.   So he decided to stuff it with 100% partisan hacks (J4U, even Chretien and Mulroney appointed at least ONE senator from outside their parties) and took full advantage of them (eg:  Duffy/Wallin as taxpaid CPC shills).    All he did was whine about Senate Reform and the Constitution while doing nothing but turning the Senate into the biggest joke its ever been.   Oh, he never met with the Provinces either - one of the first steps towards reform, if he were serious.  Trudeau, in opposition, did more to reform the Senate (by releasing all the Liberal Senators), than Harper did in 10 years as PM.     Now he's continuing the reform all without having to touch the Constitution.	0

Extra money for every year extra PLUS additional money if you FEEL you have been more than wrongfully treated).  $68 MILLION on the latest MMIW inquiry, which no one seems to know what it is supposed to accomplish.

"Incompetence, perhaps? Never mentioned in the story why this person was let go after three months. Having said that, I was once (the only time in my career) let go at the end of a three month probationary period. I had talked myself into a job that I wasn't qualified for - mind you, the employer should have known that from my resume and what I told them at interviews. There were some funky politics going on at that place and my boss consistently jerked me around, doing things like pulling me out of training course because I ""was supposed to be interviewing somebody"" - first I heard about the interview! Anyway, it was the most miserable three months of my career. I got another job within a few weeks which kept me employed for another 18 years, so I maintain that the reason for my demise wasn't that I couldn't do a good job. The problem can be with the employer, the employee or both and there may simply not be a good fit."	0
"One reason there are so many young teachers who can't land contract jobs (in Ontario, anyway) is because the school boards save a lot of money by stringing them along, year after year, as ""long term occasional"" teachers.

At 70, and making 170,000 a year, this guy is obviously doing something well outside of the public school system; even Superintendents don't make that kind of money, and none would be allowed to scale back."	0

"Yes, I suspect B16 is a rather sweet fellow, whom I probably would be happy to meet, unlike either his formidable predecessor or his formidable successor, even though there's not much about his decisions I could support.

""Loyal Dissent"" makes for a great read: quick, incisive, clear. But Curran does not go into depth regarding his more controversial opinions, which perhaps is fitting, given the kind of book he wrote, but still is a bit frustrating.  Re patristic Greek: Yes, I've read some, but don't make a practice of it.

yuknon -   The only tax loophole bill I could find was bill C-10 introduced by the Libs in 2002 and which made it to Parliament as Bill C-33 in November 2006.  It died when Harper prorogued parliament.  Flaherty reintroduced the bill in in Oct. 2007, as Bill C-10.  It passed the House and was in the Senate but died when Harper dissolved Parliament for yet another election.  So the Libs introduced and Harper played politics with it.  Kind of like the failed whatever Morneau was trying to get through.  If you have different information, please let me know.

"I have to agree with those I seldom do. The example does not fit the issue. However the issue needs to be explored. I guess Mr Briggs that you are one unwitting example of why the ""willing to be ambiguous to do the right thing"" failed to avoid Trump.  The sentence that refers to the signs at the Catholic Church tells the story of the simplistic logic the Church promoted and resulted in ""our"" electing the antithesis of ""right to life"". I grew-up with a Down Syndrome sibling who would likely have been the subject of an abortion in so many family situations. In a similar situation I would counsel my child to keep rather than abort; I would offer to take and raise, but in the end the decision would be her's.  ""Protecting the life of the unborn"" is a ruse when, as you describe the conditions for raising persons' capacity to consider and keep a child, or to avoid pregnancy is rejected. Working towards the conditions for good will and the good is the way; not unreliable promise to legislate."	0

What eminent sociologist will you cite to explain how my way of relating to my son as his father which is completely different from the way my wife relates to him as his mother is simply a cultural construct that we have been brainwashed into?  Also, I'd love to see you explain to St. Catherine of Siena that her way of relating to Jesus Christ in the mystical betrothal she experienced was just a ""cultural program"" that infiltrated her prayer life.

"That analogy doesn't work, because countries aren't like homes. The government can't possibly own all the land in the country, and doesn't claim to. Thus government restrictions on immigration are not akin to you (the homeowner) deciding how your house can be used, they're akin to someone ELSE dictating how YOU can use YOUR house.  If you want an analogy, imagine this. You advertise a room for rent. A man responds by phone. He's received a job offer in your city, and needs a place to live. You accept, make arrangements, and he mails you the deposit.  On the day the man is to arrive, the police stop him at an imaginary line. They inform him that he is not a ""citizen"" of Ruritania (your glorious nation) and that he has no ""work visa"". So they will not allow him to proceed. He is prevented from renting YOUR room, and from working at the business that was willing to employ him.  You're OK with this absurdity?  Really?"	0

"So, it is an ""insidious strand"" of ""anti-Islam prejudice"" that leads Canadians to have ""an obsession with Muslim women’s face covers"" and an attendant ""patriarchal impulse"" to want to have face covers not be a part of Canada.  Um, no.   I think there is diversity among Muslims and among Muslim-majority nations, just as there is diversity among Christians and Christian-majority nations.  What do I mean? Plenty of Canadians object to the anti-condom and anti-abortion and (males-only straights-only) leadership trends with conservative churches, and would like to see those trends fade away. That is, they prefer more liberal approaches of some United and Presbyterian Churches.    Do all those objecting Canadians have ""anti-Christian prejudice""? No. They have cultural preferences. Are they guilty of ""racializing""? Again, I don't think so, religion is not race.   Many overseas Muslims and Muslim countries are okay showing faces. It is not racist or hateful if Canadians favour that approach."	0

Head start like the Job corps programs, took a lot of funding to get started, and helped many to escape poverty.  However only about 20% of Head start programs resembled the Perry study. They tended to be more academic and some were actually call pre-kindergarten programs. These academic programs were less effective on outcomes measured by the Perry and similar studies  and may have done some harm to students who were forced to learn.  For example, children in the Perry study learned to plan and anticipate consequences. Researchers feel that this is important for the lack of arrests for crimes for the test preschool group.	0

Pretty hard to dispute that Trudeau's subconscious decision to respond in french was to directly repudiate the anglophone asking the question about minority problems in Quebec. He as any human being has betrayed his underlying feelings with outburst and actions that show him for the man he is. His agenda of running around telling the world how they should speak and act, yet unable to help some of the most marginalized Canadians is obvious to everyone. His recent speeches given in Europe regarding the elitist disconnect  was watching the surreal as this is the same government leader that has been shilling to millionaires and billionaires, taking the orders and requests for reduced regulations for foreign nationals to invest their possible illegal funds from other countries. When Trudeau slips up as he did by dragging the MP across the commons floor, he was showing his real self.Uncontrolled emotion always reveals the truth.	0

I agree that segregating known priest-offenders in a place where they can live out the lives of prayer and penance to which they have been assigned may be an appropriate solution, at least for some priests. The idea of an island was proposed by Father Gerald Ftizgerald, the founder of the Paraclete Fathers.  My point was that, absent a conviction in civil court, no-one has the power or authority to coerce accused men to accept that way of life, or indeed any other form of supervision. When the bishop severs his relationship with the priest by way of laicizing him (a hypocritical and dishonest process in so many ways), the bishop forfeits any residual control he might be able to exercise. Accused priests -- even those who maintain their innocence -- might be induced to submit to supervision and monitoring in return for an assurance that they will continue to have access to the things we all need: friendship, companionship, adequate, safe and appropriate housing, healthcare, employment.	0

I would say that Mr. Mulcair is correct in his view of Mr. Trump.  I would also disagree with Mr. Clement when he states that no one will listen to Mr. Mulcair because he's in 3rd place.  Most Canadians I talk to would agree with Mr. Mulcair's view of Mr. Trump.  What Trump is proposing vis a vis American Muslims is analogous to what Hitler started in Germany with  the anti-Jewish Nuremburg Laws, i.e, discrimination on the basis of religion.  How can anyone not see the similarities?	0

"Indeed, many millions who viewed Trump unfavorably still voted for him - given the even less favorable alternative.  I'm active politically in our area & talk to many people.  I do know a few die-hard Trumpites, but I know far more who pretty much held their nose & voted for him - and they will do so again.  They may check 'disapprove' in a poll, but as one voter put it, ""As long as the GOP message is jobs & the democrats seem more concerned with bathrooms, I'll vote Trump.""  He was a democrat - a democrat like many who feels the party no longer represents their values. The core of the democratic problem is their messaging - that people reject - redistribution of wealth & property confiscation, higher taxation, more & more entitlements, and more & more gov't involved in every aspect of your life - control, loss of freedom, over-regulation.  Indeed, ""socialism is force""."	0

The right hates fact based criticism. They get criticised for a bad idea / policy / statement. They yell and scream wave their hands in the air frothing. They get criticised a lot because they have a lot of poorly thought out idea's / policy / statements. The right then goes absolutely banana's because you've got them out over and over. So rather than come out with a well thought out defended idea / policy  / statement, they claim bias and personal opinion, etc etc. Having a better thought out defended idea / policy / statement never occurs to them of course. Also, a lot of the right wing  extremists around the place have this Utopian ideal that the 'free market' will create the ideal world if only govt, CBC, regulations, etc got out it way. Its the same thinking the communists had. Utopian. But both conveniently forgot that people have to be in these Utopian dreams, and people behave erratically, irrationally, and do not conform to the ideals that both Utopian ideals wish they would.	0

Tough to pick between two bad choices Bill.   I couldn't vote for Trump because he had zero experience in governing at any level and I was stunned by his inability to complete a coherent sentence, couldn't concentrate, and has a vindictive nasty streak, not just for enemies, but for anybody who crosses him no matter how small the offense.      No good choices.   I blame it, at least partially, on the closed (members only) primary election design.   It a rule that defends the elite over the public.  The other part is which candidate will attract the most money.     The Party gives lip service to voters, but bows to the potential millions that fund their campaigns.     The Trump campaign saw those 'lost' voters(across party lines) and made a great choice to talk to people who in most years are never courted by The Party.   (Pop.  as it's own problems)  As much as I dislike the character of the President, removing him does nothing to change a elitist patronage designs of The Party.	0

As a family with a proud history of veterans (and a proud history of people in law enforcement) I go on record as saying that if Kaepernick can help us win as a football team then go get him.  I don't think the way he went about pointing out that we still have problems regarding race in this country was very wise, or helpful, but his views don't threaten me or threaten us.  He was a very good quarterback at one time, and still might be.  And as far as I am concerned he can kneel, wear a clown nose, or do the Macarena during the national anthem.  That's his loss, not mine.  I can just ignore.  I'll stand, hand over heart, sing the anthem, and feel good.	0

... and that's where you run into trouble, not because you're opposed to Islamic extremists, but because in order to oppose one flavour of crazy you find yourself in bed with a different flavour.  Do I oppose violent extremists?  Yep.  ALL of them... but if I were to target one group, I'd find myself aligned with a different group because there's plenty of crazy to go around.  Immigrants and Refugees already face a rigorous vetting process, and the few terrorists acts that have been committed on Canadian soil have not for the most part been committed by immigrants or refugees.  If I thought there'd be an EFFECTIVE way to keep Crazy out of my country, I'd be all for it... but that wouldn't change the Crazy we already have.  Crazy is going to be crazy.  I can't fix that.  What I can do is vote for policies that help people get and keep work, make a decent wage and make sure that if they DO go bonkers, they stay in prison for a very very long time.	1
"The sentence structure requires a dichotomy. ""Real"" is correctly opposed to ""fake"" although now that I think about it ""genuine"" would be a better choice than ""real"".""Neither true nor false"" is a different concept.

""False"" news is stories story that have the appearance of news and are intended to be believed but are not true.   To take a historical example, the stories about Iraqi WMDs were false news, not fake news. The Onion publishes fake news, not false news."	0

Disclaimer: I don't agree with certain of Peta's positions, but there is no doubt they have done and continue to do much good.  The article your reference is written by a bitter no kill advocate and conspiracy theorist, Nathan Winograd, who himself does not rescue animals. He just advocates for them - based upon his ideals - and leaves the realities of saving, housing and maintaining them to others. I am of the no kill persuasion myself. However, few no kill shelters are honest: They kill by omission. They maintain their no kill stats by turning away animals because they have no room, because they're injured, diseased and so on. So where do these animals go? Do they all live with Mr.Wingrad? No.  Nor does he stop at PETA in his condemnation: He writes scathingly about all animal rights and rescue organizations that do not recognize his organization. I'm talking about the HSUS, ASPCA and many animal activist entities.  http://www.whypetaeuthanizes.com/popular-misconceptions.html	0

I get a sense that Walker isn't interested in leading his liberal friends. By this I mean why is Walker speaking to taping the earnings reserves over the  set aside billions in the various budget reserve accounts. After all, the budget reserve accounts are where he and the legislature are supposed to turn to and not the earnings of the PF.  Walker's main concern is that the legislature will resort to the easier route which is taping into the earnings reserve instead of the 3/4's necessary to get into the various budget reserves. I don't think the problem is with the conservatives that want to cut the budget; the problem is the forces behind a big government workforce and big government spending. Obviously, that's why Walker doesn't name the business who purportedly are threatening to leave Alaska; so what, let them leave. Thousands of Alaskans have asked Walker to make deeper cuts in overall government spending. Herein lies his problem and the solution. Just saying....	0

Sadly, no.  Leave it to Trump & Sessions to attack kids trying to get some protection in school.  And naturally, his slavish supporters celebrate his cruelty.  Trump is a sociopath.

School board members can also be sued individually and personally.  Trump wants a fight, so he's getting one.  Donations continue to pour into the ACLU.  Keep it coming!	0

They should be honest and just   switch parties rather than continue a losers  charade that only the most gullible would believe.

People are all unique.  We are in different places with our lives, have different experiences, and need different things to grow spiritually.  Amoris Laetitia understands this and seeks to reach out to people where they are.  Cupich when discussing the internal forum at the Synod last year illustrated this through a wonderful story about a remarried woman who received Communion at her son's funeral.  (The son apparently committed suicide.)   The woman later reconciled with the Catholic Church because the priest at her son's funeral cared about her and allowed her Communion.	0

"@FW&N  As you point out, 5th from the bottom.  As CNN was pointing out, 9th from the bottom not 6th (my bad).  But whether 5th, 6th or 9th, that is still NOT the bottom as you incorrectly quoted.  Thanks for accepting the correction.  Boo for trying to spin ""not the bottom"" as ""bottom"" again.  You were wrong, you didn't check first, give it up and move on.   If your point is that Canada should be spending 2%, I absolutely agree that Canada should meet its NATO commitments on spending and clearly is not now.  Finally, the dollar amount matters when you are comparing actual amount spent to spending by others.  No one cares if Luxembourg quadruples it's spending to hit 2% because the gross amount is just over $1BN USD, which is peanuts in $900BN in NATO defense spending.  At 2% Canada would be spending $40BN USD, which is not insignificant."	0

One of the problems with this situation  is that the US subsidizes its dairy sector and we do not.   In point of fact the whole US agricultural sector get subsidies. To put our dairy sector on a level playing field we will have to change our practices to match theirs or raise tariffs to match their subsidies and keep them there which is essentially what we have now.  From what I have read the US dairy sector wants to dump its surplus products into our markets, which is a trade practice banned by the WTO. Give them a chance and they will kill off our dairy sector if they can and dominate it.  We may have to give in somewhat but before we do we had better get ready for stiff competition.	0

State gov is bloated. Compare the population of the 60s and seventies with recent year's numbers. Then compare the revenues that were available in those decades with those available in recent years. Ever since the pipeline started flowing spending per capita has risen exponentially. And Alaskans didn't care because they had no skin in the game. Politicians spent as much as they could in their efforts to be re-elected. Senator Stevens brought in hundreds of million every year. People flocked to the State. Agency budgets went up and up. Look at some such as the Alaska Court system, ADF&G, Alaska Legislature, education and others. No one wants another to be hurt. But the reality is that those who live on the margins will have to leave Alaska if taxes, PFDs and other revenues are assessed against them. Same if they lose their jobs through budget cuts. And, sorry, but that may be a good thing for the State. Drain the bloat! Get back to an economy where we hold the policy makers responsible	0

Furthermore, the bailout forced Greece to take the hit so German and French banks don't, and over 90% of all bailout money dispersed has never stayed in Greece nor went to any Greek citizen. As for the Euro itself, I do think the political climate will change with the upcoming elections and citizens themselves will want out, especially since Trump will demand more spending from NATO members increasing more pressure on governments budgets which go against the EU budget rules. I don't think the EU will take a tough stance on Brexit, since other members might be exiting themselves and will need Britain should they exit and thus water down any tough proposal. Why would Italy or Greece take a tough stance against Britain when they might be next?	0

"Perhaps you should consider your motives in posting here.  As an alleged Catholic, and therefore Christian, you should have the love of God as your principal motive.  That motive unifies your life, it integrates, and simplifies everything.  There'd be far fewer ""needs"" for shrinks if people rectified their intentions for everything they do (even holding on to grudges) to ""for the love of God"".   ""for the love of God, I push aside this resentment"" ""for the love of God, I am going to work to do my duty as vice president, husband, worker"". ""for the love of God, I am going to soften my injurious barb, personally aimed on the internet"". ""for the love of God, I am going to stop being snarky and nasty in my postings"".

"There's that word ""deserves"" again. It seems trite at best. What ever happened to hearing what a person had to say and then responding to what you think you heard? Just because someone reads what Coulter writes and then forms an opinion about it, doesn't displace the crucible of debate. If someone doesn't agree with Coulter's written message, all the more reason to hear her out and then challenge her with reasoned debate. Laughing simply side steps the contest of ideas."	0

I was not originally talking about my own writing.  I was talking about the writings by fairly contemporary sociologists, whose works (unlike that of, say, Max Weber or Emile Durkheim) were pretentious and over-wrought.  Simple ideas tarted up to sound so very brilliant.  The last straw came when a PhD told me she wished she could write as well I did, when all I'd done was imitate the overblown, inscrutable style then current in sociology books and journals.  I agree; the legal profession was no better.  More modern lawyers, thank God, make it a point to write so as to be understood by laymen.  Judging by the way you write here, it's plain you learned that lesson too.  We don't always --- ha!, rarely --- agree, but I appreciate your clarity of thought and expression.   Cheers, good lawyer.	0
Paul what were are you on when you wrote this piece?  Anyway this legislature needs to get on the exact same per diem system that all other state of Alaska workers are using immediately.

About 20 years ago, I had the opportunity to facilitate a peer helping 3-day training event with high school students from around the Yukon Flats School District, in Venetie.  On the 2nd evening, a dance was held in which local Athabascan Fiddlers performed for the group. I was so impressed by the young people's lack of inhibition to get up and dance to the music. The fiddlers played for a little over an hour and the dance floor was full. After the fiddlers were done, a dance with contempory recorded music was held. The students hardly danced.  The fiddling was much more popular and fun.... The combination of fiddlers playing and students dancing was very heart warming....	0

"Elections were created for Americans to exercise their right to vote.  In past elections, it's proving true that too many people are being swayed by what news agencies are putting out.  May it be the truth or fiction, news agencies around the country are influencing Americans.    Americans need to gather facts on their own and recognize that not all news broadcasted are truthful!  I'm finding more and more that most news stories are being glorified to the authors liking and the American people are not in their best interest.    There are a few local news that I once enjoyed watching, but no longer peaks my interest because of ""half truths"" and worst of all, unacceptable grammar and spelling!  It really causes me to wonder who is behind the pen.  News needs to be honest, forthcoming, and most of all fair to all.  Non-judgemental, just facts and truths.  It should be criminal for reporters to publish fictitious stories just to ""better"" their career."	0
In this country, we are badly in need of some balance. While we have withdrawn huge areas in the west, and particularly in Alaska for environmental protection, the people of the eastern states live in an overly crowded, environmentally challenged living space. Therefore, I recommend we let the fire burn itself out; the president can then use an executive order withdrawing the area, making it a national monument. A few thousand property owners are little sacrifice for a national policy of protectionism. The greenbelt created will give those living on the eastern seaboard 100 years from now, a breath of fresh air; the ecosystem will have come back into balance:)	0

You also forgot about the hotel vouchers for the homeless to use on cold nights, and the bus service they get to and from, because they refuse to stay in shelters and honor their rules.

What makes you think the Donald believes in jobs?  What specific action has he tasken to actually increase jobs?  And will there be unintended consequences of these jobs?  I mean if the Donald is successful in bringing back coal jobs, he will probably just succeed in global warming.  His resort in Florida may end up under water.    And what makes you think he wants to cut back on free progerams?  He wants to increase them by increasing the militadry and building the stupid wall with Mexico.  Nothing but  welfare for the rich.	0

The lack of knowledge regarding the FDA regulation for Tramadol is incredulous. I wonder what their success rates are using Tramadol (pain medication) and Zyprexa (antipsychotic) for treatment.

""" Right wing populism ....

The State of Alaska should pay the promised oil tax credits to the companies we owe, just like we should pay pensions to retired state workers we owe.  The State of Alaska made a deal and should keep its end of the bargain no matter how unpopular it is.  If we do not think we can afford further oil tax credits or state pensions in future we should modify the policy going forward.	0

No doubt getting water out of relatively flat areas is no small task.  I'm no civil engineer, but I am a mechanical engineer, and I understand the many challenges with the known, much less the unknown.  Certainly keeping them flowing freely is very important as well.  My point was that the blanket statement that making this better is cost prohibitive is something I question.  This is going to cost a LOT.  Katrina cost $108B just in property damage.  Considering all of the other costs associated with this, especially since Houston is a major oil hub, and how this will affect the entire economy (lost money for businesses, delays in goods getting out of Houston to other parts of the country, lost wages, lost jobs), my bet is it's going to be a total of somewhere north of $500B total.  That amount of money could do quite a bit in water management, I'd bet.  Heck, a quarter of that might be enough to significantly reduce damage in future events such as this.	0
"You do realize that Trump has stated on several occasions that ""REAL"" news is actually fake.  This has led to many of his follower brushing off actual real news as fake due to his example.

I am stunned and saddened by Gabe Rygaard's death.  I got to know Gabe only through the recently completed County Commissioner primary election campaign.  I found him to be a caring and concerned person who was sincerely interested in the welfare of Clallam County.  He wanted to do his part to improve our lives.  The manner in which he conducted his campaign and discussed the issues important to him was exemplary.   Just two days ago Gabe and I had a long, very pleasant and informative lunch together.  I was looking forward to many more discussions with him, and to the logging industry tours that he offered to take me on.  I was also looking forward to discussing with him some day the topic of coaching kids' sports, a passion that he and I both shared.  It is just shocking to suddenly have these possibilities removed.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Katie and his family.  This type of tragedy is so difficult to comprehend.  I wish there was something I could do to ease your pain.	0

"One thing that will have an impact on attendance is for UH/Aloha Stadium to readjust the way it manages the Aloha Stadium parking lot.  I take the shuttle bus for games.  For the Middle Tennessee Hawaii Bowl game, I saw cars being turned away at the entrance to Aloha Stadium because the parking lot was ""full.""  NO.  The general admission parking lot was full, while the VIP parking areas were perhaps half full.  This is the same for regular season games.   There are more VIP available parking spaces than there are public parking spaces.  So if Rolo wants to have an impact on season ticket sales, he needs to convince the AD and the Aloha Stadium Commission to change the ""balance"" of Aloha Stadium parking from a heavily-weighed VIP parking facility to a friendlier public parking facility.  No matter how many games UH wins, the number of season ticket sales will remain linked to a better experience for fans to access and park at Aloha Stadium."	0

"""...in establishing a church.""  That works for Unitarians or whoever -- who reach out theologically for the ultimate vacancy of biblical thought, not on the scale of early Christianity. But for Catholics (and most other Christians) who assent to the early church councils, the unity of the faithful was established at Pentecost, after Our Lord's Ascension, and was later fleshed out in the councils and in the planting of churches all over the known world. That ecclesial scale might not meet your fancy, Frances; but for most believing Christians, Christianity without the early Church councils gives the Trinity a shrunken head with no face; and compels the Risen Jesus and Holy Spirit to surrender to shadows on some half-opened Sinai, mountain. The Incarnation, however, enables Christ to feel compassion for all of us entangled in his redemptive history, which started at Bethlehem, continued at Calvary and the empty tomb, and is ongoing in each one of us caught up in his living church."	0

"Rich creditors?!?!  What ""rich creditors""?  Greece defaulted on their debt back in 2012, their non-government creditors received pennies on the dollar.  Those creditors don't deserve pity but equally they don't deserve any scorn, they took their lumps and won't touch Greek debt with 10-foot pole.  The creditors now are government organizations, the EU, ECB and IMF who have lent Greece money taken from other countries taxpayers (including Canadians, we help pay the bills for the IMF).  Why?  All so that Greece could continue to stay on the Euro.  The solution is, and always has been, for Greece to abandon the Euro and reprint their own currency then devalue it until they reach a level of poverty that is sustainable given their productivity.  That isn't being ""mean"", it is being realistic for everyone involved, both creditors and borrowers."	0

"Thanks for your entirely uninformed post.  Even if what you said is true - which it is not - we could still be seeing an impact due to AGW.  What if a higher percentage of today's hurricanes reach ""major"" status (> cat 3)?  That alone could be significant.    But if you look back at the records of the strongest storms (in terms of max sustained winds, 1 min. avg) the data show a disproportionate number of them occurred in the more recent decades (my first quick look at Atlantic hurricanes showed 6 of the top 7 occurring since 1980, for instance.)  Feel free to go ahead and continue spouting lies while ignoring what the data says to further your head-in-the-sand agenda.  Simple physics states that warmer water carries more energy, warmer air can cold more moisture.  Observations conclude the air has warmed, the oceans have warmed, and the seas have risen in the last 100 years.  How could these NOT affect what hurricanes do?"	0

"Thoughts on Trump & Putin:  1) Having spent more than a year  1959-61 as a GI  on the East German border along with hundreds of thousands of other NATO troops I'm disgusted that Trump seems willing to throw away some of what we were protecting; 2) Having spent the summer/fall of 1968 in the Soviet Union, where I experienced  a lot of ""mir i druzhba Amerika"" and intense desire for a Free Russia, I was thrilled when Gorbachev brought about  democratic changes and  the freeing of the other republics  and satellites.  3) I was horrified  when Putin took over,  attacked that long awaited freedom and reverted to an aggressive foreign policy  4) Appalled that Trump has spoken approvingly of Putin's behavior and even jokingly asked Russia to hack an American political  party, and 5) Disgusted but not surprised that the DNC was favoring Clinton over Sanders, either because they thought she was a more electable candidate or out of old style political cronyism--sort of like the RNC and Trump."	0

This has of course been a common practice of his, but to do it in this manner—and to lie about how previous presidents responded to the deaths of soldiers—is as low as it gets. We have a pathological liar in the White House, unfit intellectually, emotionally, and psychologically to hold this office, and the whole world knows it, especially those around him every day. The people who work with this president should be ashamed, because they know better than anyone just how unfit he is, and yet they choose to do nothing about it.

"<I applaud anyone who dodged the draft because they believed Vietnam was an immoral war.> I distinguish between ""draft dodgers"" and ""draft resisters.""   Resisters were those who objected to the war in principle, who did so publicly by refusing to be drafted, burning their draft cards, accepting imprisonment, even escaping to Canada -- that is, who incurred and accepted the consequences of their objection. Dodgers were those who simply did not want to go and who used whatever means was available to them to avoid going. For the most part, the means were legal and ethical (if not always entirely fair) -- student deferments being the most common. There were, of course, ways to game the system -- to use money or influence to get undeserved deferments. Toward the end of the draft, a lottery system was implemented and most deferments were eliminated.

Actually I believe the death sentence here was having a blood alcohol level so high that letting it come back down to normal levels killed him. He died of DTs.   This hyperbole about it being on the police is just more cop hate parading as concern. The cops did what they were supposed to do, they checked him in at the hospital, which cleared him to go to jail to detox.   What should the police do when someone has thrown their life away on addiction and is medically cleared to be in their jails to detox? You all seem to like to complain alot, but bring very few solutions to the table.  Only a handful of people talking about needing addiction help, and everyone else hating on the cops and hoping this guys family gets rich. Such a sad narrative on such a non-reponsibility holding society. Yeah it isn't the guys fault that had a blood alcohol level that in school that taught us was WAY past the death line.	0

My understanding is that after the clawbacks you got 2.5%/year increase. I am aware of the cap but can't really say I know how it affects most practising physicians. In NS we received 0%, 0%, 1% and 1.5% increases over the 4-year deal.

Economic times are not good, there is evidence inequality is growing within developed countries with worrisome consequences and physicians in Canada generally do well. I am not filthy rich by any means (nor do I have any desire to be) but I certainly don't have to worry where my next meal will come from.

Huh, msw speaks of countries that ever overrun by a militaristic movement of ethno-fascism in the 1930s and 40s, and how terrible it would be if that would happen again.  Gee msw, think about it.

It seems to me that the person with the greatest reason to complain to Morneau is Trudeau himself. Morneau didn't break any of the rules in the Ethics Commissioner's purview but he DID break explicit instructions from Trudeau which other Cabinet Ministers had followed.

I am not so sure about America's standard of living dropping in the event of trade drying up the way you propose.  America has an astounding bounty of resources within its borders, from food to minerals to lumber to energy sources.  How do you define standard of living? Do you think the average Canadian's standard of living is better in 2017 than in 1967? If so, why? Because they can buy a really inexpensive colour TV today? Do you think Canada massively increasing trade with China over the past few decades has improved Canada's standard of living? If so, how?	0

Whether it's an ethnic community or a special interest group, you'll find it in a city.	0

"I wanna know - since you know the ridiculous stipulation of Native Hawaiians ""having to eat their catch"" out there - rather than ""bringing it home to sustain the ohana"" - AND HAVE NOT CORRECTED IT - is proof to me of YOUR FAILURE AND THE OTHER OHA TRUSTEES - TO NOT DO YOUR JOB.  IN FACT, that stipulation stems from the ridiculous ""original finding"" - that ""since the oldest deep sea fish hook FOUND BY BISHOP MUSEUM dates back to 1824"" - THERE IS NO PROOF - ""NATIVE HAWAIIANS DEEP FISHED PRIOR TO 1824"" - - - which is totally absurd - and OHA PAID FOR THE REPORT ON ""NATIVE HAWAIIAN FISHING RIGHTS"".

Part 1  It has been said that language names and interprets our experience of God.  Terms for God such as Lord, Master, Almighty Father, King, the Holy One, all suggest transcendence and power.  Other language used to express who God is--shepherd, servant who washes feet, woman who searches for a lost coin, a father who welcomes back---connotes a more personal relationship.  There is a significant difference between the transcendent and more immanent terms for God.  The more immanent terms describe relationships of a more personal and intimae nature, and include both genders.    What message is being conveyed by our predominant use of titles portraying power and dominance for God?  How does this support patriarchy in society?  How does our nearly exclusive language for God limit God? --------- Ref. James E. Griffiss, NAMING THE MYSTERY: HOW OUR WORDS SHAPE PRAYER AND BELIEF.

No.  I listened to a climate scientist I was working with and he showed me the numbers.  I ran the numbers myself and that's what I determined all by myself.  I didn't need anyone to show me how either.  Just simple math.  And I suck at math.  This was about....7 years ago.  So should still be good numbers.  Just take the data the pro guys put out that shows how much is being produced now, and then how much temp change they say it's gone up, then you figgah what you gotta do to drop it back to where it was before it went up and then you get your number.  Pretty simple.  Even the scientist guy was laughing at me struggle w/ the math.	0

The average family insurance cost through and employer is not about $15,000 a year.  I've had a family for 30 years. We've never had $15,000 in costs in a year.

"You really want to direct people to Heller, Dog?    You risk folks coming to the realization that the internet representations of the Second Amendment have been liberally (or conservatively as the case may be) edited and bastardized to support NRA-speak.  Never understood how the SCOTUS took concept that ""a well regulated militia, being necessary for the security of a free state"" (which is what the 2nd actually says) and extended to a right not to be required to have trigger locks on home kept weapons.   An additional low point for the same basic Court that gave us Citizens United.  Both good examples of how constitutional provisions, and their interpretation are subject to political winds as much as legal ones.   Which is why I agree that as currently configured, the SCOTUS takes the side of gun likers to use the 2nd to knockout any attempt to legislate gun restrictions.

The average suppression level, according to independent tests done on a variety of commercially available suppressors, is around 30 dB, which is around the same reduction level of typical ear protection gear often used when firing guns.  However, for most commercially available fire arms and cartridges, this ends up only reducing the noise level to somewhere in the range of 130-150-ish dB for a supersonic cartridge and 117-130-ish dB for a subsonic cartridge. For reference on just how loud that is, an ambulance or police siren is typically between 100-140 dB.   So if we imagine the shooter had a silencer, the difference in carnage wouldn't likely have been effected.	0
A tale of two airports. Heathrow, Airport London in England is private. It was privatized some time ago.Its expensive. It's chaotic and it sucks.

Certainly there is more than one word for things, which is why I said normally.  We used to call it dope in high school because that is what the police called it when they toured around to our school telling us not to do drugs.  The police used that word for a reason because it has such a negative connotation.  You're smoking dope because you look like a dope and you are a dope.  When I got out of high school and met people who knew their drugs I realized that to those who use, dope means heroin.  I would not advise asking for dope when you want weed.  You will look like a narc, or you will get heroin (neither of which is a good thing).	0
The climate change response commission is an excellent idea! Alaska suffers more than any other state in the union from the impact of climate change - whether an Oklahoma lawyer or Donald Trump choose to believe in it or not!  Basic staffing for one or two people  could be funded from  The proposed increase to gasoline taxes, or from minorreductions to incentive subsidies  for exploration. The importance increases, given the attitudes and staffing reductions that are occurring to the EPA, the Coast Guard and every  other Service or analyticfederal agency that greatly impacts Alaska. Cost for this piece of legislation would be no more and probably less than the piece funding ANWAR tours  for congressman.  I could also support that legislation, if it included mandatory stopovers to dialogue with the subsistence living villages of ANWAR.	0

Red Sauce pizza has had a similar effect on my pallet.  It reminds me of Joe's Pizza.  It's the most joyful pizza I have eaten in Portland.

A survey of Colorado voters in 2008 showed 68% overall support for a national popular vote for President.  Support for a national popular vote for President has been strong among Republicans, Democrats, and Independent voters, as well as every demographic group in every state surveyed.

With the National Popular Vote bill, all of the presidential electors from the enacting states will be supporters of the presidential candidate receiving the most popular votes in all 50 states (and DC)—thereby guaranteeing that candidate with an Electoral College majority.	0

"Your comparison of the colonoscopy costs, illustrates the basic flaw in 'government' healthcare. While I don't think that government should pay for ""elective services"", it is true that a preventative procedure, such as the colonoscopy, has a fixed cost and it's likely not $10K.  What amazes me is the fact that the current ACA is a failure but the ""Frankensteins"" want to keep it alive, instead of submitting actual ideas to improve the new legislation. Preventative medicine is the cheapest way to keep long-term costs under control. Penalizing people and doctors is not a good way to control costs."	0

With no chance of reelection, and with no track record to judge a candidate by, we would be completely open to wreckers paid by special interests. We would see a proliferation of lobbyists, especially former elected officials who had spent their single term cozying up to whatever special interest would provide them with a lifelong job after their term ended. We would see a decline in political savvy among our inexperienced representatives. We would see an increase in cranks, crackpots, and the unqualified to represent our interests, as the surprising popularity of Donald Trump illustrates. We would, in short, see government actually run by an unelected class of partisan managers. just my opinion. of course.	0

In a nation where >30% of people cannot come with $2000 in 6 months... 86% have a credit rating of good or better? They do because they use HELOCs to cover for the negative cash flow.   Nobody cares.

I also think those in the military and declare state residency when they are stationed here should not receive a PFD until they return to Alaska.  Many never return to Alaska.    What about a business that receives federal money to support their business?  I don't know...why don't we look at aviation.  Should those business owners lose their federal money?  Should we take the PFD?    Leave the damn PFD alone, restore it.  Cut out all the stupid tax credits and outrageous deductions for the oil and gas industry, mining, tourism and commercial fishing.

None of what you say has any backing in the Gospels and the Gospels - you know the books that teach what Jesus demands we do instead of man, including imperfect bishops, say no one has the right to treat (therefor ordain) anyone differently than they want to be treated themselves.

Fathers and Mothers are equally parents and equally co-create with God in making all children.  Women do not have a greater role in raising or nurturing children - priests or not, than men.

"""An idea that seemed plausible and gathered a lot of excitement when it was proposed decades ago lost its traction as the 2008 economic crash took its toll on the RTD system.""  This is absolute hogwash. The northwest rail line was dead in the water before the 2008 crash ever happened. Most of the same factors that make the line extremely unlikely to be built in most of our lifetimes existed at the time Fastracks was being proposed. So why was it part of the plan? Because Crooked Cal Marsella knew he needed a big turnout from Boulder and the northwest metro area in order to win at the ballot box.  My frustration is not that the northwest line won't be built, it's that RTD didn't follow through on its Bus Rapid Transit promises (no, the Flatiron Flyer isn't BRT - it's the BV, BF and BX with a new paint job) and continues to make bus service cuts in this area. And if we contact our RTD rep about it, she's too dimwitted to respond with anything other than a staff-written form letter."	1

"+10.  We run a 10 person manufacturing company.  We rarely finance major purchases and owners' pay is kept quite low allowing profits to remain in the company (as retained earnings).  Several years ago we saved more than $1,000,000 of ""dead money"", then after 6 years build a new factory without financing.  Over those 6 years the money was invested in safe passive investments.  This is how we choose to run our business.  When the 2008 recession hit we weathered it no problem, unlike GM Canada that required a massive government bailout.  Now Mr. Morneau is proposing to tax the returns on this type of money at about 75% while he and Trudeau use rhetoric suggesting we are tax cheats.  Disgusting."	1

"It is bizarre that this article, in a Canadian newspaper, is silent on China. China was not even shown in the summary graph!  Hello?  Points to ponder:  1.

Um, hello, China is the main source of money that has skyrocketed house prices in Vancouver, where thousands of parachute families live (breadwinner dad in Hong Kong or Beijing or Shanghai or Moscow or Tehran).  4.

In theory I agree with you, but this only really holds valid in a world where you cannot get any kind of window into possible future behaviour.    It's also technically true that we cannot guarantee that a firearm owner will responsibly store ammunition, secure their firearms, and won't use them to shoot up their local school ... but we still ensure every owner has taken a firearms safety course, has agreed in principle to abide by our laws, and has no glaring issues around mental health or social instability. We do what we can to reduce the risk, even though there's really no possibility of eliminating it.  So, if you knew that a certain Salafist sect was virulently against gay marriage, and had a history of persecuting and even killing gays, could you improve the odds of successful integration by screening for membership or participation in that sect?

Providence is owned and controlled in full by the Roman Catholic Church.  They are responsible for the conditions related in the letter.  Those conditions reflect the failure of their ownership and management as they have refused to negotiate with employees, especially nurses, for better working conditions.  At the same time continuing to raise prices and retain tax exemption status based on religion when it is a completely economic operation devoid of any religious significance other than ownership.  My comments address the totality of the healthcare failures of religious ownership and control of healthcare services illegally restricting human rights to legal secular healthcare.  The quality of that healthcare is just one component in the broad issues of religious ownership and monopoly.	0

Add to the cuts, that the Republican Healthcare Plan will increase the insurance premiums of every full time employee in Hawaii because it will eliminate the Federal subsidy that allows employers to reduce premiums for health insurance they provide to their employees. The Republican plan eliminates the 40% tax credit for employers who provide health insurance in order to provide a huge tax break to top bracket taxpayers that will average close to $200,000 per year. Every full time employee benefits from the subsidy that comines with Hawaii law requiring employer subsidies to reduce premium costs in Hawaii and for small businesses nation wide.	0

"The Conservative Party’s effort to pass a new motion cleansed of the word “Islamophobia” and replaced with condemnation of “all forms of systemic racism, religious intolerance and discrimination of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs, Hindus and other religious communities” is obstructive and, frankly, misses the mark. It does not help to alleviate the incredibly hurt sentiments of many Muslims.  give me a break. obstructive how? misses what mark?  i don't care about your feelings, snowflake. you have no right to have your ""feelings"" protected. the jews have suffered far more than muslims and not just had their ""feelings"" hurt. They've been discriminated against,  murdered, their houses of worship burned, their nation constantly under threat of nuclear annihilation, all by muslims. And then theres the holocaust.

If you'd like to argue otherwise, by all means I am listening, but so far your replies are nothing more than vague and cynically dismissive. As such, you've left us no other option but to believe that you agree with Mr. Eastman's indefensible position, as well as the tenets of alt-right ""conservatism"" that are,  by any measure, bereft of morals, humanity, and decency- rather, they are based on self centered indifference.

With this anti-movement in truth so prevalent, why do we have a seminary--Andrews University or any professors? Don't we believe those who have researched and studied the Scriptures their entire careers given to the service of God?   Shouldn't we listen to such godly persons or do we put our views ahead of them?       We have our different cultures and opinions that stubbornly go against  Christ and His love. Now that is real rebellion. It doesn't care about evangelism in other places. (Sabbath is usually not accepted for cultural reasons.)     God reaches people where they are and is patient with their growth. (Remember that harems were once the custom.) Can't we allow each brother and sister to grow in Christ as He has revealed Himself to them? To do otherwise is to commit oneself to the beast and its image whose goal is to divide and conquer and to take away our freedom to think under the Spirit that has spoken to us in our location.  We must do nothing to squelch the Spirit.	0
"Let's identify the Catholic agenda:  The Roman Catholic Church is determined to turn Protestant America into a Roman Catholic country, and since the ""new evangelization"" has only produced tepid results, her best bet to do that is to bring as many Catholics into our nation as possible.  To that end, the USCCB and 20 major Catholic orgs (not including NCR) are encouraging illegal immigrants to break U.S. law, and more disturbingly, to risk their lives.  And risk their lives they are -- over 250 illegal immigrants have died this year while trying to enter the U.S.   If their church had not told them they have a moral right to enter the U.S. illegally, these Catholics would likely be alive today.  The leadership of the Roman Catholic Church has a stake in Reconquista, just as they did with the cover-up of pedophile priests."	0

Politics is easy.   They sell and brainwash to the masses that they are increasing taxes on the small % of rich people.  Well guess what.

aaronavilla>  My eyes are wide open.  Are your eyes wide open also or are they clouded by the fog of losing the election that much of an issue with you?  Clearly, the point here is that the DEMs have vowed to create all kinds of problems whenever and wherever they can to hinder the process of good governance.  The courts did what they did because of what they had interpreted to be an unconstitutional order and stopped it from being enforced.  ACLU should help POTUS resolve his problems with the DEMs, since they claim to do all sorts of good things, and like the courts are non-partisan.  You must be dreaming if you believe what you had stated in you post.  Yes, the job of POTUS is not an easy one.  It takes an iron will and determination to prevail at all costs.

When you're at work, you don't have the right to spout whatever comes into your head. Try it and see how long you last. When the players are at the game, they are at work.

"It's funny, but I think some people are so used to Hollywood endings that they see them when they're not there. I loved La La Land. But I know people who complained about Ryan Gosling's white savior character. I had to point out that the movie is riddled with movie nostalgia and that Gosling's character pines for the jazz of the past not the future. He doesn't get the girl in the end. He does open a small jazz club, but with the money he made from playing the kind of jazz he doesn't like. He doesn't call his club Chicken on a Stick, but goes with Emma Stone's Mia's more pragmatic ""Seb's"". The ending is a riff on Marjorie Morningstar, a forgotten movie in which the handsome lead played by Gene Kelly can't rise to the same heights as his love played by Natalie Wood. La La Land gives us both the fantasy and the reality. And I think jazz will do just fine with or without Mr Gosling. And I wouldn't be so hard on Mia's husband as we're not shown the romance, just the daily life."	0

Well, what I meant was that pension costs are a pass-through, that is, a cost of doing business; and the customer pays.  That's where the money comes from.  A defined pension plan must figure into the cost of the product.  Of course it's not a one-time cost, it's a cost amortized over time, and for the private corporation going into bankruptcy it is an obligation that exists along with other obligations in the determination of the court.  Motley, where are you?  I need you to explain this!  Money is nothing more than a debt obligation.  Public entities (I'm pretty sure) can't declare bankruptcy and evade their debt obligations.  That would screw up the value of the dollar.  Maybe I missed your point?	0

"This is a public safety issue, not an ideological battle over helping poor people, but it is also a concern about public funds being used to provide $400,000 ""low-income"" housing units which are not built to current codes and energy efficiency. If it falls, as it appears likely, we can only hope no one is injured or killed, and that the public won't be on the hook for the ensuing lawsuits, but we all know the bureaucrats responsible won't pay the cost of this disaster waiting to happen. They should at least lose their jobs for this supremely bad judgment.  For $400,000 per housing unit a LOT nicer homes with separate lots could have been built, albeit perhaps not in downtown PT.

I don't like discrimination in any form, but I do see a problem in this case. If the farmer had discriminated against customers buying apples at the Farmer's market, yes, barr him from participation.

If he's that uncomfortable with same sex weddings and feels hosting such a ceremony puts his soul in jeopardy, he should be able to say no. However, he should then be prepared to see his business suffer as people vote with their dollars about his homophobia and discrimination against same sex couples. If you feel that strongly about an issue you should be willing to suffer for it, shouldn't you? He displayed this homophobia on his private property, not in the public arena in town at the Farmer's market. I also understand the city of East Lansing wanting to distance themselves from the homophobia of Tennes by barring him from the market.	0

HI:I invested in Maple Leaf Green World (TSXV:MGW) in April at .10 sold in Nov for .70. I started in 2013 with 5.5K and invested(bank stock) and added each year 5.5K (10Kin 2015) each time investing in solid div paying stock..I took a chance with 12K on the pot market in 16.  I have been in stocks since I was 19(66 now).  When booze was legalized major money was made either side of the border. Many rich Canadian family's got that way through the lifting of Prohibition.  I think it's going to be déjà vu all over again but it won't be pretty or predictable.  Personally I have seen too many people(my kids friends) start on pot and some how loose their way(that may have been the drugs fault or not I don't know). The same can be said about spirits but in the same way as alcohol brings in big excise bucks so will pot.   Skyofblue, it does add up.	0

Had he used, as you mention, a very obvious and clear manner"" he would have quite likely been subject to federal prosecution for making such a threat.

"Bob A. - you nailed it in reference to the Hannity/Limbaugh industry of misinformation, disinformation, slander, slur, innuendo and insult.

What is even more sad is 1)the progressive movement has in many ways copied that approach and 2)so much good could be done if such resources focused more on solving the problems of our democracy.

My quibble about this article (a well-written, thought-provoking article btw) is that the 6.8% gross return took place during 2016, a bull-market year. I hold a self-managed,  high-dividend portfolio that yields 5.3% in dividends and interest outside of any capital gains. My view is that 2017 will be a zero capital gains year. I will still get my 5.3%return that costs no management fees. If we see a zero growth in stocks, what does that do for the model portfolio described in the article?	0

Benchmarks like that are used routinely throughout the world doing project planning especially in the beginning stages. It provides an envelope for projects with reality boundaries while details are being developed to fill in unknowns. To give you some credit, yes, there are always unique variances between projects. But in this case, it's the fully elevated component. I believe Honolulu has the only low capacity (higher than a bus, yes, but below what I consider high capacity rail) fully elevated system. The benchmark planning procedures for such unique cases is to look at it in terms of upper cost envelopes available and rework as needed when lower benchmarks are exceeded. Of course more complex, but it's an iterative process with engineers, suppliers, etc, until the unknowns become manageable. I am not sure the unknowns are manageable yet on this case. That's one of the key issues plaguing the project, like it or not.	0

It certainly makes sense NOT to have multiple time zones OR Daylight Savings Time.   DST increases risks and is a hardship for some workers (who work long hours to begin with).   It makes little sense anywhere and none at all at our latitude.  However, I think we ought to retain the Alaska Time Zone.   There is not much to be gained from matching Pacific time - and even that would only be for half the year without DST.   It would also create the peculiar situation that Alaska would not be in the time zone named for it!	0

"""So I'm not sure these guys have a good handle on the problem.""  You are right on target, monicadeangelis. Maybe the very secure English bishops are attempting to push their less secure, more fearful or fainthearted counterparts in, say, Brazil to move forward in regard to ordaining married men. Security sometimes provides a greater magnifying glass than insecurity. Of all the Roman/Latin Catholic religious communities in the world, the English Catholic Church knows best -- sees best -- how successful married Catholic priests function in parochial ministry. When I was in UK this past January, a Catholic cleric told me that in some areas nearly 10% of the Catholic priests in UK are married (former Anglicans). And they are doing just fine, too -- accepted by the laity. Still, most National Bishops' Conferences are hesitant to more forward on this issue/this need. There has to be a reason for this, of course. (And they can't blame the pope.)"	0

Disagree.  There are two other untapped sources that I suspect would yield more tax revenue:  the dividend tax credit and the principal residence exemption.  Think of the tax revenue that could be generated by treating that like capital gains with an exclusion rate, and the rest subject to tax.

"Marc,  You must be very clever to know what Ivo's entire point was, and brimming with misplaced confidence to exhort anybody to ""stop defending the indefensible"" - at this stage I'm not even sure what I was defending, although I anticipate some hubristic enlightenment shortly.   DM is not traditionally a place to denigrate Christianity (or any other belief), so I would be very surprised to learn that this was Ivo's mission; rather, I saw his article as a justifiable and otherwise excellent reproach to those who very publicly attributed only good deeds to God, oblivious to the effects of their ovations, instead of acknowledging the contributions made by so many people of their own free will and irrespective of their beliefs.   Everybody is entitled to a belief system, so I was a little disappointed when Ivo, having argued so intelligently against the public outpourers, felt the need to trot out the now hackneyed Good God:Bad God dichotomy."	0

David Rosenberg has never run a business or created a business.  Yes, he makes $3 million a year for writing a daily newsletter and pontificating.  But he has been mainly wrong throughout his career.  Yes, a broken clock gets the time right twice a day, but he has been mainly wrong since 1987.     For example, in the National Post this week, in his terror over automation and technological advance, Rosie can't fathom manufacturing plants with less workers, but MORE factories.  So Rosie won't understand today's announcement that Foxconn is planning to create manufacturing plants in the US (likely for Apple products), and yes they are more automated.  Rosie is just plain out to lunch because he has never created a business.    As an aside, Rosie knows a lot about food, but not retailing.	0

The automatic enrollment into ESL programs is because at the beginning of every school year a postcard is sent to every student's family or guardian to fill out and sign. Questions include if any foreign languages are spoken at home and what they are. That info is compiled at ASD headquarters and sent to the feds per ESL grant requirements and students are placed into ESL programs.  Your story brings up yet another instance about ASD's lack of accountability. Since you were required to take an ESL test before you graduated, it means you were still counted on the ESL rolls throughout high school though you did not partake in ESL classes.   Where did the money allotted for you go? It would be interesting to know how the ASD accounts for the entire ESL money received from the feds and how it's actually expended. How much and for what purpose do ESL dollars follow each student?	0
Nope.    The main difference between us is that after ten years of both prosecuting and defending, I know for a fact that evil people exist who murder, rape, and assault other people as well as commit lesser crimes.    Many of them told me so personally because I was their attorney and it couldn't go past me to anyone else.  You, on the other hand, don't think anyone should ever be convicted of anything and most particularly should never be convicted of sexual offenses.  You also do not believe that anyone who is convicted should ever go to jail.  With those blinders, any testimony or facts that show guilt are unacceptable to you.	0

Alex,  I basically agree, however...  1. The Trump Administration has experienced several setbacks and needs a win or two to steady moral.  The upcoming NAFTA negotiations will be of high interest to important elements of the Trump support base and begin soon. 2. If the international trade policy of the Trump Administration is more than simply transactional machismo, then it is implicitly 18th-century Mercantilist with Canada and Mexico envisioned as economic hinterland to the US's metropolitan centre. 3. Canada may not run a trade surplus in manufactures but we do in certain industries (ex. softwood) and the US will cherrypick for decisive wins wherever there to be found.  In short, Canada better have its own list of unfair US trade practices with which to bargain and be cultivating trade allies and new markets.   Becoming a quasi-neocolonial backwater to the US is a fate to be resisted.	0

"I suspect that going from 5 cents to 10 cents will not have much effect on people returning bottles but may incentivize street collectors a little more. Inflation has reduced the value of returning bottles by about 84% as the inflation adjusted value should be nearly 30 cents. Going to 10 cents means recycling have about 1/3 rd the original value or incentive.  The real value of a bottle or can should include the ""cost"" of not recycling. Hard to determine I suppose, but it would include the visual eyesore of litter, long-term accumulation as they don't break down, threat to wildlife, loss of resources (metal, glass and oil) and safety hazards.

Re: GM ... yes, the company is successful in China, but the country is moving quickly toward electric vehicles.

"Apparently you have not bothered to read the text at issue over which you have set your hair on fire.  M-103 is not a bill being voted upon, it is a motion (the letter ""M"" is a dead giveaway). for debate by a private member of the House of Commons.  Also it not only covers ""Islamaphobia""  - ""condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination"" and ""develop a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating systemic racism and religious discrimination including Islamophobia, in Canada, while ensuring a community-centered focus with a holistic response through evidence-based policy-making, (ii) collect data to contextualize hate crime reports and to conduct needs assessments for impacted communities"" per the wording.

Physical and psychic pain are both natural defense mechanism.  Without it, we can be hurt further.

Not all of the population for any town will live within walking distance of the rail. That's true here and in all the cities on the mainland that have rail. That's why they have buses feed in and out of the rail stations from the different areas of the communities and that is why don't need to have the long run buses. There will always be people who would rather drive and that is up to them, but the rail is for people who don't want to sit in traffic and the headache of dealing with other drivers and getting there faster. You don't have to worry about parking your vehicle.	0
The bigger issue might be the presence of the wandering capybara. They don't thrive alone, even as a pet, so there's probably at least two there. They mate once a year -- gestation lasts five months -- with an average litter of four. They eat mostly thin-blade grasses and a lot of them, as any rodent that can reach 150 pounds or more would. They make lousy house pets because of their size and desire to gnaw on everything. They're also hunted in South America for their meat and fur. Because they live near water, preferably rivers, they'll migrate to wherever it's wettest but are mostly homebodies. The good news is, they don't belong to any public employee unions. Yet.  Sounds as though Lane County's river-dwellers might have some serious competition, if mating season gets out of hand. The trick will be telling them apart.	0

Religions become popular when the survival/salvation of the people is at risk, or when a unique benefit is promised as a reward for membership. When neither of those motives is operational, religions tend to devolve into communities of special meaning. In our day, some Christians are committed to social justice, others to doctrinal purity, others to pro-life/anti-abortion campaigns, and still others to inclusivism, etc.  The societal pressure to which you refer is being replaced by the pressure to state what one truly believes instead of remaining in the crowd and pretending to accept everything. I think that's healthy for the church, but sooner or later it will require a restructuring that recognizes this heterogeneity and doesn't make believe the old one-size-fits-all parishes still make sense, if they ever did. We could anticipate that restructuring by refusing to support the diocesan system, and that is pretty much what is happening, as this article shows.	0

"So, how do you stop a terrorist attack by car/truck?  Especially in a country like GB where guns are not allowed? Refuse to sell potential terrorists a vehicle?  Ridiculous!  As bad as saying, ""you can't own a gun"".  In fact, can you actually stop an attacker in a vehicle with a gun?  The movies would make you think that you can if you have enough bullets and are a good enough shooter.  I suggest that you have maybe 3 seconds to do it at best.  Getting out of the way is probably the best reflex to do, but with a crowd of people that would be difficult.  So how would you readers do it?"	0

"Understand very personally your statement.  Also agree completely here ""need to work together to modify and fix it."" People with pre-existing conditions (not disabled, they do qualify now if factually disabled for SSDI/Medicare and that is factual) are not sustainable for insurance companies nor the companies customers. There is no such thing a free money. ACA is financially unsustainable and the Dems know that too.    *I am very interested in your solution. (Remove ACA from the equation, it is and will fail of its own accord so that will be out of commission soon enough.)   A partial solution is getting hired at companies that offer health insurance.  Pre-existing  medical conditions is normally not a employment block, nor is a disability.    So I will close with this. Paying insurees and insurance companies cannot carry that cost.  So who does?  Government has stripped funding to these insurance companies that they were promised for exactly this scenario. This was done under Obama."	0
This area of Eagle River is a regular thoroughfare for bears. Likely has been for decades or longer.  The recent neighborhood developments haven't changed this much (within the last 30 years).  Bears, both black and brown, still use this natural funnel going to and from the river.  My friends and I see them in there frequently throughout the year.  Many folks in the neighborhood walk their dogs, hike, bike, and run these trails often.  It's the wise ones who go prepared with the proper tools: bear spray, whistle, air horn, cell phone, and perhaps even a firearm.  However, nothing is a panacea.  The best protection is caution, common sense, and staying alert to surroundings.	0

"Kim Jong Un may enjoy seeing his ""toys"" detonate but with his nuclear capability still more theoretical than real, his efforts are mostly meant to intimidate foreigners and rally his own people. The North Korean people suffer daily from the stifling, authoritarian restrictions placed on their daily lives by his regime. Kim needs these regular distractions, especially those sparking nationalist fervor, to hold on to power for awhile longer. The new economic sanctions have yet to take full effect but if they fail to make a change in Kim's tactics a military strike by the US or its allies in the region may be unavoidable. Unfortunately, the peaceful resolution option is increasingly becoming less tenable every day this crisis goes on."	0

"Alaskan oil workers earned "" Oil credits"" but in truth if giving back less than 1% or $800 million dollars of 12.5% Royalty on the 19 Billion Barrels of oil production to do it again most would have to agree that is a good deal!    Another 12.5% Royalty on the next 19 billion!  Support oil workers in the form of incentives and earned oil credits so they will drill and produce another 19 Billion Barrels of oil production and 7 Trillion Cubic Feet of Natural Gas that allows the state to take 12.5% Royalty for free!    All Alaskans enjoy a free share of the landowners 12.5% Royalty on this produced 19 Billion Barrels then that would be a great deal for doing nothing but taking all this oil and gas for free!    HB 247 will make it so you can't get it free any more because it will run oil and gas companies out of Alaska 24/7!

You have no idea what you are talking about.  Tell me about those many, many benefits.  You seem to think it is the military that starts wars etc.  Nothing could be further from the truth.

Starting wars, employing the military etc is solely the responsibility and authority of politicians as war is nothing more than the extension of politics.

Even assuming you are working at a non-physically demanding job, you really see a dwindling of job opportunities as you get older.

As for taking my CPP early, I knew all the arguments. But I decided I would take it early anyway as it seemed to be a good time to do so, at least for me.

The city of Columbia, SC took a carrot/stick approach. First, they put resources into insuring there was enough shelter space. Then the made it illegal to be homeless, with the plan to take everyone to a shelter. They revoked the law after a week after police said it would be too expensive to enforce. Plan B was to take people to shelters once to entice them to get off the street, hoping people would choose a bed over a sidewalk.	0

Why don't the doctors en masse exit OHP and other provincial plans? They would be able to set their own rates ( like dentists, physiotherapists, chiropractors and optometrists ) and health plans would reimburse according to a prescribed schedule by insurers. In the age of electronic payments, the doctors cash flow would be secure and doctors would be allowed to charge less to patients not able to afford it. All that they would not be able to do is directly bill a government plan like OHIP. For too long, the doctor's have allowed the government's fiscal problem to become their own. The government would be unable to stop the strategy.	0

It's ironic that Fr. Rush chose a painting of the washing of the feet from John's Gospel for the cover of his book. The way that passage has been misinterpreted by the institutional Church is an example of a skewed hermeneutic if ever there was one.  John presents a simple, beautiful story of humility and charity. Only those willing to touch the dirt of another, to kneel before them in loving service, are worthy of discipleship. It's the heart of his version of the Last Supper.  But what has the institutional Church done with it? Turned it into a pompous lesson on clericalism. Only the ordained get to do the washing. And only men get to be washed, lest the intimacy of an act of tender service become something lewd. And that this self-indulgence is incorporated into the Holy Thursday liturgy is enough to make one gag.  This is what happens when exegesis isn't free of self-interest. You just end up circling the wagons around your own preconceptions and privileges.	0

"I ran for State Representative in District 43 in 1996.

The Democatic Party has sold out to the globalized multi-national corporate interests and abandoned working class Americans.

Steve Bannon publishes an article in Breitbart citing two Anonymous sources from an unnamed Security Agency;  Trump tweets about the report as if it is established fact in order to divert attention from the fact that two members of his administration, that were also integral in his election, both had conversations with the Russian Ambassador prior to his inauguration.  So in a nutshell, Trump uses a hollow anonymous source to create a fake news story in order to divert public attention from the real issue of his pre inauguration ties to Russia that is supported by actual physical evidence.	0

Lane County for Bernie Sanders has been active in the community for almost a year.  The UO for Bernie and LCC for Bernie groups arose last fall spearheaded by students that started with LCFBS.

When official campaign staffers came to town last week, they gave it their blessing as the first official campaign office in Oregon. The owners of the building sold the pews. The campaign had nothing to do with that. We have definitely appreciated the hospitality of Theo's Coffee and Cozmic Productions over the many months we held our Saturday meetings and phone bank events there.	0

Eliane, I may be wrong, but it seems to me that Cardinal Bernardin was not saying that each of us had to be equally activist in all pro-life activities, but to recognize that they are inseparable from one another. Can we say we are pro-life if we don't care about children living in poverty while we campaign to overturn Roe? Can we be advocating for war, supporting the death penalty, or supporting programs that gut education, food stamps or care for the mentally ill and be considered pro-life? As I understand it, the crux of his position was that they cannot be viewed as independent issues, but as all aspects of the same cloth. It is a strength that people are called to different aspects of Catholic Social Teaching, for each of them is critically important. That is the beauty of the seamless garment - the issues are integrally connected just as we are, just different colors in the tapestry.	0

The crooks in Juneau are as bad as the thieves and junkies in town. Dis-elect all you can this coming election and elect someone who WILL do something about SB91 and it's 'get-out-of-jail-free' card for the criminals in Alaska, someone who will find the funding to start putting the criminals behind bars.

Gary,  You have to admit it's probably easier for you to accept the results of the so-called democratic process (a bit of a stretch in the era of Citizens United) because I'm going to make a calculated guess that your skin color and gender are very similar to that of the white Americans that handed Trump, an overt racist and sex abuser, victory. You have the luxury to hope Trump and the fascist party he represents will go against everything he's said and everything they've done. Are you actually proposing, though, that non-whites and anti-racist whites embrace a president who has instigated violence and hatred against people of color? I am incredulous that you could take a guy like Trump's promises seriously but then again, I'm gonna guess that you're in the same demographic group that Trump is. Again, I guess you can afford to make that leap of faith because if you're proven wrong, you'll still be safe and sound when the white supremacists start looking for people to hang from a rope.	1

If a professional receptionist, working as the public face for one of the 439 most powerful people in the world, can not answer more than 150 phone calls during a shift, then there is a serious problem in her office.

"Hi OC.  I understand what you and Annie are saying. I really do.  I would like to think so, but even if the importance of Eucharist is a given, if it is not provided due consideration for being done well, it can easily be relegated to a side-show.  I'm speaking from experience, here, where a parish that I was a part of in the 70s began to focus on ""community"" and the actual Canon slowly became  the ""downer"" of the Mass.  Then the priest began to ""dress things up"", adding his own interpretation of the Words of Institution, the narrative, and even interpretive dance as part of the Eucharisic Prayer.   I'm not saying that this is bound to happen but, again, if the focus on the accidents of Mass, the substance can (not will) become of less import. I hope this clarifies my position."	0

"A quick look at early comments tells me the anti-immigration/anti-multiculturalism crowd got their talking points emailed to them early.  Too bad for them.  Economists have made the case that to keep Canada competitive, and to fund everything from health care to paving roads, we simply must have a substantial amount of immigration.   Canada is a young country, still discovering itself.  At the same time, it does have very deep cultural roots, and I don't fear the coming wave of people who ""want to change our values"" -- simply because they either don't, or they just won't, especially if they want to flourish.  Many people come here precisely because of our values.  I know a couple who came to Canada from Saudi Arabia because it was no place to raise daughters.  Immigrants who want success will integrate in most ways, yet still bring the creativity, diversity, energy and vitality multiculturalism offers, even if they are brown and maybe Muslim. And don't pretend that's not your problem."	0
Obama was recorded lying to the American Public about all the surveillance on its citizens. Snowden showed all phones, emails texts etc are monitored. In Canada also.

He also hid the fact he was gay, enjoyed cocaine and married a transexual. Why not do a full article on Obama and leave Trump alone.	1

It's asinine platitudes like this that ensure most Canadians will remain throughly mired in mediocrity, straining to live their dream lifestyle on their declining wages supplemented by massive debt. Complaining all the while about it and demanding the government ""fix"" it. (The ""fix"", usually involving taking wealth from people who actually made sacrifices to achieve it.) Meanwhile billions around the world work 100x as hard for a fraction of the money and will - and are - rapidly overtaking complacent, airy-fairy places like Canada.

"The Vatican conference was sponsored by a group who had Burke on its Board.  ""Donald Trump’s newly named chief strategist and senior counselor, Steve Bannon, laid out his global nationalist vision in unusually in-depth remarks delivered by Skype to a conference held inside the Vatican in the summer of 2014. Well before victories for Brexit and Trump seemed possible, Bannon declared there was a “global tea party movement” and praised European far-right parties like Great Britain’s UKIP and France’s National Front. Bannon also suggested that a racist element in far-right parties “all gets kind of washed out,” that the West was facing a “crisis of capitalism” after losing its “Judeo-Christian foundation,” and he blasted “crony capitalists” in Washington for failing to prosecute bank executives over the financial crisis.""

Are you saying that because parallax methods, measuring redshifts, and using stellar candles such as supernova are not 100% accurate that therefore they are not ""best guesses"" as to distances within the cosmos?

Do you not believe that galaxies exist?  You're not staying hard and fast to any claim. I claim ""the best guess we have based on all the observable evidence points towards a very large and very old universe"".

"That is true on the face of it. Which is why I doubt there will be an impeachment before the 2018 elections--the Republicans are collectively behaving like the proverbial three monkeys and see, hear or speak nothing.   Impeachments in the last two decades have become about politics, and not actual crimes. Unless Trump loses his base completely and the threat to the Republican majority in Congress becomes obvious, I agree there will little movement on this before 2018.   But his support has hold around 40% approval, and so far it is  (though Nate Silver has a good analysis of why that is a soft 40%). If he stays there he'll be ok. He dips to 25% or less (i.e. Nixon 1974 territory) he might be in trouble. Around that point, Republicans might rediscover what so many were saying a year ago-- ""he's not a real Republican."""	0

Denver needs to stop f'ing around at TE and sign Gary Barnidge. Elway made a huge mistake last season when he sent out young QBs with no proven veteran at TE and the results prove that. None of the TEs on the roster have ever proven to be reliable. Barnidge was a reliable TE when playing for the Browns, a team that practically had a new QB every week. The fans in Cleveland loved him for being a consistent, good player in their sea of dysfunction. Barnidge would a be cheap, low risk signing that would help Lynch and Siemian tremendously by giving them a sure-handed veteran receiver in the middle of the field.	0

nel4: Perhaps my comment wasn't specific enough. I think the situation in Toronto and Vancouver validates the argument put forward by the British economist and Oxford professor Sir Paul Collier, who holds that mass immigration and globalized migration are at best only marginally beneficial to Western societies. He's noted that such policies tend to generate differential economic and social impacts, with corporations and the rich the main beneficiaries and the less well off (including other recent immigrants) paying an often disproportionately steep price, including facing greater competition for relatively scarce affordable housing and employment opportunities. But raising these valid issues in Canada prompts predictable howls of outrage from virtually all political corners. We're just not permitted to have a reasonable and mature discussion about these things and none of our major federal parties seem inclined to change this.	0

"Joseph, I think the answer to your question depends on your definition of ""church.""   If you see the church as being an organization, you are probably right.  But if you see ""church"" as being a living, breathing community of people struggling with their faith, having personality, living independent lives as they struggle in the real world, think I think there is a very strong need for the voice (concerns, hopes, fears, beliefs) of the laity to be heard at every level of the church. I think your last sentence pretty much answers your own question.    So if you want ""good"" to come from church, and you define church as being the organizational leadership, then you've got your answer in the scandal.  If you see church as being that billion people who comprise the laity, then I think you have a very different answer.  I don't propose democracy here.

"sirencall,  Your lies are starting to add up as there were absolutely no ""off the cuff"" interviews you conjured up made by Trudeau with anyone prior to his official release at 9:00 PM that I referenced.  The entire Parliament core was in lockdown until quite late in the afternoon and actual events had Harper having an emergency meeting with both Opposition leaders to discuss the situation and clarifying what took place before the press release.   Even from your link there is no reference other than the 9:00 PM news conference he had after Harper and Mulcair that I supply below.   ""Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday night that he was saddened by the shootings and condemns ""these brutal and heartless"" acts of violence.  Mr. Trudeau called for continued co-operation with Canada's Muslim community ""to help prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion.""   You've done nothing but embarrassed yourself making fake news about the tragic event."	0
Unless there is a provision in the Hawaii fire code there is no need to sprinkler each unit.

And another thing, those dams posed a significant risk to the lives of those living downstream, including the lower Elwha Tribe.... and maybe you don't really care about that.... but the people who live there do care, and I'm sure they're fairly relieved they don't have to worry anymore about a catastrophic flood from dam failure.   And had those dams failed, you complain about increased costs from roads washing out....  a dam failure would have destroyed everything.... so it's a mute point.   As to the US 101 bridge.... just because it wasn't a problem before the erosion doesn't mean it isn't a problem. The gravels and silts found in the Elwha valley are prone to liquefaction, so it's highly likely that, regardless of dam removal, if a big one hits, that bridge with no solid foundations would certainly collapse.   And we have the highest standards in the nation for new infrastructure.... so I while I won't claim a new bridge is indestructible, I'd say it has a hell of a better chance.	0
Agree with you that people living there should be mandated to have flood insurance.  One poster on the DP boards is from Florida and said they're still dropping mobile homes in those areas.  The requirement is to safety strap them down.  But, they still fly apart when the hurricanes come.  Stupid.  Not sure if you're old enough to remember Andrew, but if I recall, didn't one of the big insurance companies claim bankruptcy in Florida because they couldn't pay all the claims?  That was a classic.	1

Funny isn't it. The more rational Liberals are showing their real fears.  What kind of monster are they about to create? Medical experts have warned them yet they obsessively drive head on at high speed into a massive destructive wall thanks to the will of their stupid leader. Everyone knows there's far more reasons to discourage Canada's use of pot than there are to encourage an even greater use of the drug - except for him.   So go ahead, try and create a real tough law to feel better about yourselves.  Will you stop pot and alcohol from being used together? Absolutely not. Your own leader openly admitted doing so illegally with friends after dinner when he was an MP. We also know that lots of people will drive on both drugs as a two-drug cocktail lowers judgement even more.  With kids and pot, guess what? Your new law will put so much pot out there it'll be far easier for all kinds of young children to have their brains permanently modified by the drug by the time one's 20 yrs. old.	1

Obviously, he was a significant force for the anti-Apartheid cause. But Apartheid was the Dutch settlers’ attempt in South Africa to safeguard the integrity of their culture and nationhood. The settlers weren’t willing to submit or surrender to the Bantu majority. When you compare theirs to the North American experience, British and European settlers brought disease with them which effectively decimated large portions of the native population. Therefore, they didn’t have the same challenges as the South African settlers and as such had no need for a policy like Apartheid.	0

I don't see you adding anything positive to this discussion with this particular post, ToTL, just more unbridled anger.  A lot of us are angry these days. But angry accusations get us nowhere, such as your accusation that  I don't care for our less fortunate citizens. In fact I have often defended the unfortunate here, and I'm sorry that you can't acknowledge that. As to past policies, those under Obama have raised us from the brink of disaster to a more normal situation where more people have jobs, money, and health care. What's bad about that?  Anyway, now the ball is in Trump's court. We'll see how he does. And since both houses of Congress are Republican, no one can blame anything on the Democrats.	0
Look at the comments from the right here, as every day -- more petty shots at Trudeau, more denial of climate science, more cheer-leading for Trump.

"Really sorry to hear this. Too bad the city closed down Whoville. It may have been a little messy but it was working for some people. I visited it a couple of times.

The other party said no remarriage, no divorce, period.  Refresh my memory: who took the hard line? Who offered to make allowances?	0

She is absolutely right. The DACA order was always precarious legally, since the companion DAPA was struck down by court. It was always supposed to be temporary. The activists have given recipients a false impression that it was a genuine protection and the only thing that could be a problem was a mean president. The kindest thing was to force Congress to address it, with a time limit, and pass a real law. The unkindest approach would be running the risk of a court order ending it overnight. Or he could have ended it January 20th or with no wind down period or time for Congress to do its proper function for a permanent and secure resolution to the risky situation Obama left behind.	0

Let's look at the open carry law from this perspective, to own and carry a firearm you have to be registered first, that means you have to go through a background check with the FBI for criminal and mental history, and that takes about 2 weeks to a month, depending on how long the wait list is . so law abiding citizens who are legal to carry a firearm open carry while common criminals or extremists and people who commit haneous evil acts conceal their illegal weapons, and are not stupid enough to attack someone who openly displays their weapon, so really who would you as a non carry american citizen feel safe around , and wish to be near if the need for protection came down to it in the event of an active shooter or terrorist event.

Not a zero sum game though.   The community can grow and thrive in one or both structures.    Assuming it's zero sum doesn't account for increased. performance, maybe by both.  I have no doubt that human history is shaped by the power of strong communities.     That in no way minimizes what an outstanding individual can do, but again, in most cases, they are still within a team/community structure.       No easy thing to encourage the growth of the individual and still maintain the cohesiveness of the team.   When you find a balance it's a very rewarding feeling for all involved.         There are many choices for the individual of course.   We can chose a monestary in the alps or a townhouse in Chicago.   No one right answer for everybody.	0

And yet another NCR piece attacking the president-elect.  I'd wager that since the election, NCR has published more attacks on the character of this president (and he hasn't even taken office yet) than were made during 8 years of the last president.  So many prog journalists were utterly humiliated by this election, yet few of them seem aware of it.  Something in the gospels about such blindness if I'm not mistaken.	0

"A question: The article states: ""Delta runs about 6,000 flights a day during peak summer months. The airline has more than 800 planes..."" So that's 7-8 flights per day per plane, day in day out, no time off for maintenance. Am I missing something or is this just plain wrong? (Or course, when the article says ""more than 800 planes, I figure they mean something like 820, and not 3000!)"	0
Call me naive but I thought Donald Trump's transition period would be a time of calm and studying up on how to run the country. Why did Trump spend valuable weeks doing a pointless Victory Tour? It's like studying for finals during summer vacation.  It looks like his Presidency will be a chaotic period of denials, lies and confusion. Everything will become he said she said.  I also don't think Donald Trump will actually do any work. He likes campaigning and being the centre the attention but being in meetings all day will drive him crazy. It looks like all the paperwork will be dumped on Reince Priebus, Mike Pence and his children.	0
Yes, we know how smug and self-satisfied you are with your life. How you think you are better than everyone else. You're living on easy street thanks to the taxpayers who pay your pension. Then you have the nerve to say that even burger flippers should be taxed in order to support you.  You think everyone should make sacrifices except you.

The probable reason why the FTA is not willing to increase funding is the city has not found a means to control the funding fiasco.  From the very beginning, we knew that three billion dollars would not be enough to complete the project.  When the rail discussion first began, the public knew that it would take much more than what the city projected.  Why are they planning to build twenty plus rail stops?  That means that the riders who get on first will likely be waiting for almost as long as they would driving a car.  If you have a child who needs to be picked up due to illness and you work in town or Ala Moana, how frustrating would it be to stop fifteen times?  They need to consider reducing the number of stops or maybe have the overhead route become a one way into town in the morning and west bound in the afternoon.  Just add the off ramps on both sides.  Open the roadway Monday through Friday and conduct maintenance on the weekends.  Open the roadway for easing major accidents.	0

"“It’s time to pay a living wage, to pay your taxes, and to give your workers the benefits – and peace of mind – that come with stable, full-time contracts.""  That's a hell of a quote. However, talk is cheap like wages. This government could actually empower RevCan to go after the wealthy, make corporations pay taxes, mandate a ""Robin Hood"" micro tax on all stock trades, improve employment standards and make the social safety net springier.   This government could get real and start talking about people/citizens who have rights instead of constantly referring to calculated abstractions like  ""jobs,"" which are owned by employers.   This government could start  using metrics that measure the health of our communities and society rather than mouthing the traditional metrics associated with  the ""economy"" that really only track how efficiently the wealthy and the corporations move their money from place to place. However, this government won't do any of that. They are Liberals."	0

I agree with you but unfortunately it is set in the constitution that First Nations are separate.     Having people being forced to live on isolated patches of land that are far from any jobs, opportunities, and quality education is a sure way to ensure poverty.   The Chretien /Trudeau white paper and a gradual payout of compensation and elimination of the Indian Act and Treaty rights is the only way to fix the communities.    It will take 2-3 generations.   Treaty nations would have to agree to it which is unlikely to happen.	0
It's being cut more than in half . The funny part is that many who haven't been paying attention won't know until the governor hold up the white card at the end of this month  saying this year's PFD is 1000 , down from over 2000 last year.  Why ?   Because Walker wants it to appear he cut the state budget and is counting what he's taking from every man , woman , and child as part of the cut total.  And he needs more money in the state treasury to pay for his obsession---the gas line.	0

"Cheap land in Alaska can definitely be a trap.  You can occasionally buy 5 acre parcels in the Susitna Valley for $5,000.  These parcels are parts of ""subdivisions"" the state plotted and held land lotteries 30+ years ago.  On a map they look great.  One sees all these right of ways for subdivision roads.  But roads were never made.  Often these cheap lots have no trail or river access.  And very often, much of the land is black spruce swamp.  A few years ago I was contacted (likely found via web search) by an Indian IT guy that lived in NYC, that had bought one of these junk parcels.  He was asking me how to access the property (after he bought it).  So what led this Russian kid to this property is a story that is repeated now and then thanks to folks getting duped by ""cheap"" land for sale in Alaska.  As baby boomers that got remote parcels for free in the 70s and 80s get old and divest, we will surely be more of these ""land traps"" for sale, and calling the unwary to ""adventure""."	0

And the environmental lobby continues to whimper and whine about how certain segments of society ""pick on them"", seemingly oblivious to their own unwillingness to compromise!

As the recently retired Chairperson of the Kailua NB, I want to note that this article needs some corrections. This will also provide some advise to the Nanakuli-Maili NB and others who are trying to keep tour companies from taking over our beaches in residential areas. It is true that commercial activities are prohibited by the City at Kailua and Kalama Beach Parks, and all public rights-of-way from Lanikai  to Castle Point. However, the City jurisdiction ends at the high water mark. So the City has no control over the sandy beach. As a result, even though commercial activities are prohibited in the Park portion, the DLNR is still issuing commercial permits for the beach. Currently, they have issued five permits. (Other commercial activities are occurring because of the lack of police enforcement). Compounding the problem is that the City Corporation Counsel has divined that the companies with DLNR permits can transit the beach park to get to the sandy beach.	0

How dare Trump and his wife make a second trip to Texas and Louisiana to show empathy and provide comfort to storm victims.  He passed out food, kissed and hugged a child, shook hands with a person of color, and thanked first responders and volunteers.  He even fit the liberal mold for being “presidential.”  It is terrible.  Liberals are having mental breakdowns trying to find fault with this visit.

Most of them will play injured - even with pain, i.e. Jake McGee, 2016.  Jeff Francis and others also have hurt the team by doing it.  The reason is that they are afraid that if they go away to heal, someone else will take their place and they'll never be invited back.  Doesn't matter if it hurts their team, they do it anyway because it usually benefits them.  They get another day of MLB service tacked onto their record (as Huey often points out, it's important for their retirement benefits).  From their perspective I can see it - but it's bad for baseball.	0

If you got quite good at this skill, you'd probably enjoy shifting to loading your own shells and enjoy the high skill of muzzle-loading.

As Mr. Ibbitson seems to suggest in his article, putting an entirely-free market Canada at the hands of a protectionist and highly-subsidized world is tomfoolery.  Good, perhaps, in an economics textbook but unlikely to work well in real life.  I'm also against privatizing Canada Post - it will just leave to some other and likely more expensive  form of subsidies to keep the mail moving across a country like Canada (incidentally, I despise the postal union, though I like my local post office employees).  I haven't strong feelings on the CBC either way.  While there are some things in the platform I like (i.e. returning to Harper's 250,000 immigrants/ per annum is a reasonable and, worldwide, relatively high level for immigration) Really, if Maxime Bernier wins the Conservative leadership,  I'm likely to (gulp!) vote Liberal in the next election, unless the NDP offers a better platform and leader.

If Dr. Suess is so tired and worn, it's shocking they keep on making Suess movies these days. Sorry, but screw her.	1
"I wonder if Feinstein's use of ""dogma"" was actually strategic. I imagine she's aware that, for many, it's an oppressive-sounding words that elicits an involuntarily negative response. It definitely sounds less positive (and less liberal) than ""social doctrine"" or ""moral teaching"" or a host of other terms she could've used that would've been more accurate.  If all this leads to a serious discussion about what it means to practice one's faith in the public arena, I'd be all for it. Bring it on. I'd love for the door to be opened to a robust discussion about whether one can be a conscientious, pro-life Catholic and still be opposed to legislative and judicial restraints on personal choice. For the record, I believe one can.  But I don't think that's what Feinstein was doing. I think this was an intentional shot across the bow of Catholicism. And she deserves to be called on it."	0

"I find the Trump campaign slogan ""Making America Great Again"" very offensive. If financial wealth is your standard for greatness then the ""Donald"" is certainly set. You would think he would appreciate the nation that allowed him to amass his bundle and that he would consider the place pretty darn great already. But as with many of the ultra rich enough is never enough. They always want more. It's sort of pathological really. He really doesn't care if our economy thrives so that all of us share in America's bounty. That would take away from his bottom line and sooner or latter he'd fire us all. Trump saying America is not great is only a catchy slogan meant to lure the gullible into casting their vote in his direction. Apparently gullibility is widespread but it doesn't change the fact most American's think were are a great nation already whether the ""Donald"" has the grace or humility to admit it or not."	0

"That's all interesting Lisa but it really avoids the issue.  And you seem be making some misstatements yourself.    I did not say that Djou ""was going to raise taxes.""  I said that his current position includes ""possibly seeking a further GET surcharge extension.""   If Djou has now ruled out that possibility, or is claiming he never took that position, he should say so directly and explain how he would complete the project without a surcharge extension. Djou seems to have lots of trouble offering specific answers, and people have caught on to that.  ""Looking for other ways to fund it"" doesn't say anything and thus doesn't really count.  At any rate, my questions were really for Cayetano.  Have a nice day."	0
Express trains would improve commute times and improve ridership, but that doesn't seem like a realistic option given the track capacity and the way the lives are designed. Alternating stops, however, would shave time off of each and every ride on the W Line, and make it much more attractive for people in and near Golden. It's certainly worth trying before RTD cuts the level of service, which will just make the W Line even less appealing and drive ridership to even lower levels.   Alternating stops should have been considered from the outset, but RTD would rather listen to developers and consultants instead of the people who actually use the service.	0

To be fair, we have a school system that sneers at those who don't want to head straight to college.  Vocational classes have dwindled, & those interested in the trades have a difficult time finding information & training available, along with the stigma of not wanting to move into a dorm and run up college loans.  So those who might have been excellent candidates to become the craftsmen & laborers you need struggle through high school & either pursues a college degree they don't want, or go to work in low paying service industry jobs.  This problem you speak of has been building for at least a couple of decades, & was masked by lax immigration enforcement, which provided labor but allowed it to drive down wages, making the jobs less attractive.  A new law to require schools to explain options in the trades and the military alongside the college recruiters might help, if schools take it seriously, and the training/apprenticeship options are expanded.	0
The Republican Senate leadership tried to sidestep legitimate debate and meaningful compromise over its bill. Thus it's no wonder it could not get the necessary votes among its own members to pass it. A health care bill in which participation is not universal, important funding to support it is relinquished by excluding tax revenue and where states can change the terms of insurance with little substantiation would have left many without coverage. Those who would have suffered most were those needing extended care such as the elderly. This GOP replacement of Obamacare, a fundamental campaign promise of President Trump, always appeared to be a cure lacking a disease.	0

Name me one river in Canada, that if dammed would not impact some natives in some way (hunting, fishing etc). You can't, because there isn't one.

For anyone interested in comparing how the BC economy did under both NDP and Liberal regimes, here are two reports that examine the differences:  https://thetyee.ca/Views/2009/04/23/BCEcon/  http://news.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NDP-vs-Liberal-Performance.pdf  One comes from the Sauder School of Business, the other is an investigative report published in the Tyee.  Conclusion?  From both reports -  the NDP fared just as well as the BC Liberals (if not better) as an economic steward of the Province.	0
"As failures our mayor, legislators, and governor have been to the people of Hawaii, the consideration of looking to the developer/private sector to bail out Hawaii's rail fiasco may be the best last resort.  The hope of saving the economic/financial integrity of the rail project has ""left the station a long time ago"" thanks to the inept management. Having been a developers myself, developers will not throw good money at a bad project, but there is a number that will make sense for a developer to be willing to participate.   The focus is no longer in trying to recoup our losses, It's about CUTTING OUR LOSSES.  So doing a deal with a developer(s) to at least stop the bleeding makes sense.  I continue to urge that we don't cut short the route or the quality of the rail project.  And state and city government must accept that you are going to have to ""bend over"" to make the deal work for the developer...after all it is your fault!  Not a perfect solution...but it is a solution."	0

Trudeau's a lightweight who won't make it past his first mandate because the Liberals aren't listening to anyone outside of the GTA. All three parties are past their 'best before' date now and are due for replacement. None of them have any independent thought, everything is dictated by the US or the banks. As for Freeland, she's so far out of her league, and in being so presents a perfect example of today's politics in Canada: connections and cronyism top capability or character every time.  Now that Harper's gone, won't have to vote for Trudeau again.	0
Such numbers should be exposed and discussed more openly.  The reason why they are not is because the main stream press in the US are part of the collusion.   The journalists and anchors like Anderson Cooper, Matt Lauer and Katie Couric in the US earn annual salaries of 10-25M a year, comparable to the top end of the CEOs of these companies.     It's up to the companies and shareholders to decide compensation, but the shareholders probably are not even aware that this is happening in the companies that they own because it is so rarely reported in the news.	0

The question nobody is asking is why are we packing more and more people into the city? Who benefits? Not people like Mr. Wong who would presumably like a bigger yard, no strata council and to not have to listen to the neighbours going up and down their stairs.

Sounds exactly like those in 1999 who quit their jobs to trade the market. Most everyone of them went broke.  If you have 30+ years of doing this successfully, then more power to you. But as you've said in the past, this success (whatever your view of success happens to be), has been over the last few years (10 or less.....the .earlier years as you said were no very good .) Ever think the market wind has been at your back?  The dividend-growth nvestment approach, no matter how much you enjoy denying it, has proven to clobber the average market returns for a very long time. Maybe even a wee bit longer than you have? That significant outperformance of investing for dividend-growth only goes back to 1860. Yes, that's right, 1860. But I'm sure that record cannot compete with a Cat's prolific record, right?	0

I would like to bring attention to a couple of examples of similar situations to the Senator, which have resulted in very different outcomes. There have been several female teachers caught having inappropriate relations with teenage boys, some older then the teen the Senator manipulated ,who have had their day in court  ( or are awaiting trial), for their behaviours, yet his moral standards are not before the courts?????? Then to show the real coward he his, calls on race being a factor to this witch hunt before him. This is no witch hunt, he was caught with his pants down.  His wife and children may have forgiven him, but the Canadian people do not have to. This is not what we seek in Senators.  Then when this is all dealt with, he will be dealing with other charges of harassment of staff among other charges regarding his superiority complex towards those who worked for him. How long before he does some real serious injury to another woman if this is swept under the carpet.	0

Every person who ever died in a factory fire because some rich asshole didn't want to spend money on fire extinguishers is a death on capitalism's head. Every person who ever died from a disease which WOULD have been cured if he could afford medical care - is a death on capitalism. Before 1900 the child death rate in Britain was around 60%. During the industrial revolution, largely due to child labor (which libertarian ideology insists must be legal), it rose to 90%. 40% of all children dead before age 10 in a 108 year period (until Britain outlawed it in 1908) is on capitalism. Every other factory accident or death caused by excessive working-hours, insufficient budget for safety measures or other unsafe working condtions is on capitalism. Every mining disaster which would have been prevented if proper precautions were paid for.  The meme used idiotic measures.  I only have to count the workplace deaths to beat all governments combined - communist, capitalist and everything in between	1

Exactly. This is a complete 'you'll beat the rap, but you won't beat the ride' scenario. In my life, I don't think that I've ever read an arrest affidavit that's been filled with more exculpatory information than this one. Her allegation coupled with the fact that he acknowledged her presence at his place, mandated his arrest. Her story, mainly her delay in reporting a bunch of contradictory 'facts' makes her entire version of events very suspect. He, technically, didn't have the right to physically 'escort' her to her car; However, the fact that she escalated the situation by returning to his residence certainly mitigates any claims of harassment. More importantly, her claim that he then shoved her down the stairs holds no water as the (independent & non-involved) ear-witnesses, ALL asserted that they never saw nor heard a physical confrontation and that they ALL would have heard such a confrontation as they had ALL alerted to HER screaming.

The Donnille's are property owners and do not ask for, nor need, our advice on what they like or don't like from overspray.    At the same time, as conservatives will point out, one's liberty to act is partially limited on doing no harm to one neighbors.     The Donnille's personal health and business affected by spraying.   It's their property, their decision, they take/own responsibility for those choices.  I am not committed to eating only organic food.  I'm not an organic farmer.

I hope no one has to go through this, but if one does, then hope they will be committed to justice for their loved one. Be the voice for their loved one. We do appreciate the community’s support. Will we ever get over this? Doubt it.	0
The reason is to make sure that you have a positive ID that can be tracked anywhere.   Just like a passport, TSA-Pre, and about 100 other federal government issued IDs.  They want to know who you are and where in case you are a terrorist.  Why is this hard to understand?  Don't want one - do not get one.  Use your passport or stay at home.

Good and while your at it get rid of the worthless TSA. You know the one that has and is costing billions of Dollars, that all think that they are cops and harass and inconvenience the public. You know the Agency that with all that expense has not caught one terrorist or suspect leaving from an American Airport. Not one! The same Agency that has failed 70% of the tests to smuggle dummy explosives into the Terminals. That's right 70%. Is that unbelievable. The same Agency that's other branch is Homeland Security that has a  bunch of wannabes cops, running around with real law enforcement doing prescription  drug raids and harassing old men in Recreational gold panning clubs along with NOAA and the rest of these clowns.

The U S immigration mess can't get much worse for them but in could get much worse for Canada. The liberal opposition in the U S needs to give Trump and the Republicans a fair chance to try to improve their situation. In Canada, we need to hope we get the wise political leadership from Ottawa that allows our country to deal with the immigration problem that is unfolding. Considering that, it is easier to be optimist  for immigration improvement in the U S and pessimistic in regard to our own country.	0

"ok - I'll bite.  studded tires aren't materially better than the current generation of modern snow tires (Blizzak, Michelin x-Ice, etc).  I don't have a problem with studded tires per-se, except for the fact that folks seem to think that there's no additional cost to using them.  How much does it cost the state (per year) to re-surface the major roads every 7-10 years?  Millions upon millions per year.  No problem, but you may have heard that the state faces a major budget crisis.  There's lots of cries to ""cut state spending"". How much more in taxes are you willing to pay each year to repair rutted roads caused by studded tire damage?  I should throw out a comment on banning the use of small rocks as traction aids in parking lots.  Sand works as well, which is why they use it on the highways.  Rocks are cheaper, and keep the windshield replacement business busy.  Anyone care to do the math how much the use of rocks costs Alaska vehicle owners in windshield and paint damage?"	0

Comey explained why he didn't prosecute Hillary Clinton. She hadn't done anything except keep a private server, which warranted a reprimand. The beef and fire is found in the fact that so many of Trump's team had dealings with Russian operatives or the Russian ambassador himself. That Flynn lied about his contacts. That Sessions had to recuse himself. That as the investigation proceeds Trump has become hysterical in his denials.  Who's the boss? I'd say it was Putin. Who else? Even the Russian ambassador laughed when he heard Comey had been fired. They've put a cuckoo in the White House and they're laughing in the Kremlin.

Let me make sure I understand:  A Presbyterian is trying to tell Catholics how the Catholic Church should run?  A Presbyterian is teaching Catholics about the priesthood?  While we are at it, why doesn't the Catholic Church just cease being Catholic and become Protestant?  Well, as long as Presbyterians get to tell Catholics how to run and govern their churches, perhaps this Catholic can tell the Presbyterian what he should do in his Church.  I think it is high time the Presbyterians rethink this whole congregational governance thing.  I mean--the idea that self proclaimed elders and trustees get to make policy and vote on the minister seems rather silly...	1

We were both vocal about it. He had lost a step and was starting to fight nagging injuries, but he was the fiercest hitter the Broncos had and a key part of the chemistry. By cutting him Elway showed the other players that chemistry doesn't matter. And for a team trying to get bigger and meaner up front, we took a step back in the secondary and got lighter and weaker. Simmons has technique but he doesn't intimidate anyone. We don't have to mention the coverage, 51 points tells us all about that.  Elway also ran Wade Phillips out of town. How are the Rams doing?

"To those who are critical:  My son is a student athlete on the UAF ski team and does receive an athletic scholarship, which pays for a fraction of his tuition.

The ski team does not buy his ski equipment for him. His uniforms are on loan to him from the university and returned at the end of each season.

As a skater born in anchorage in 77 who skated the park illegally because it was prohibited, and highly enforced. It's really not any different now, and has been this way since the beginning. I believe camping there is illegal so people sleeping in sleeping bags is more of an issue of already present laws not being enforced.

"The use of a weapon in self-defense does not require a ""warrior.""  And even a priest is allowed to use force to defend himself.  Thus, the fact that Jesus was neither a warrior nor a priest is no bar whatsoever to the legitimate use of force in self-defense.  In fact, the Catechism states:  ""Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a GRAVE DUTY for one who is responsible for the lives of others. The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility.""  CCC 2265."	0

Adam Lanza .should. have been subject to the background check because he was part of the household that the guns were taken to. .

"Here in Alaska and Anchorage, weather forecasting is a marvel of accuracy compared to what it was 40 and 50 years ago.  Can you imagine, no satellites and no computers.  It was more like choosing a condition by where a ball landed in a game played by blind-folded players.  When everything lined up like, ""Well, we have sunshine, today,"" or ""It's calm, overcast, and raining, today,"" it was  accurate.  But, when there would be a windy Turnagain arm, countered by an opposite wind from Knik River with something creeping over the Chugach Mountains from Whittier, and other outside influences, it was almost a shot in the dark using approximations with some divination based on experience.  We did have aerial observation, knowledge of cloud types and data like temp, humidity, barometric pressure, winds and wind speed collected from weather stations , and weather balloon data in the pre-satellite, pre-computer days.  But, it's simply much more accurate and long range, now"	0

Love the Leafs,    Their are certainly blocks within the Democratic Party that are more left leaning than we have seen in decades, but in general, the Democratic Party was further to the left in the 70s and 80s than today.  Hilary Clinton was a clear centrist in the US and proponent of the status quo.  Her block within the Democratic Party is actually quite conservative (small c) in many respects.  I'm actually pleased to see the Democratic Party finally shifting a little more to the left.  This is the only way I see progress taking form in the US and for the Democratic Party to recapture the White House. Not too far left mind you, but something approximating our Liberal Party's position would produce some positive developments in the US.	0

Straight out of the republican and Fox News playbook.  What's really pathetic about you MAGAphants is that you don't even realize how you're being played by Trump and his rich buddies.

"Sort of off topic, but regarding fire hydrants. ...

The EPC ignored the fact that a pumper truck would have to park at the fire hydrant 150 feet away from the condos and would make it impossible for another emergency vehicle to get by in either direction.

Wow quoting Rex Murphy now...Perhaps its a good idea to post Murphy's many articles denouncing Obama and his fawning articles about Sarah Palin. And of course his many articles calling climate change a farce.  Muphys ramblings are more and more alt right and more and more embarrassing.. His article is nothing but spin, it is not a case of either or but of both.  The settlement was necessary and correct on both fronts first because Khadrs civil and charter rights were trampled with  the collusion of the Canadian government and because settling now is better for the Canadian taxpayer.	0

When I was getting my first full time jobs in the '80's, Ontario Hydro had a reputation as one of the best utilities in the world. Not the best in all of Canada or North America, one of the best in the whole world.  Ontario Hydro could distribute power reliably and cheaply from the southern tip of the province (which is further south than the norther tip of California) to the far northern reaches of the provinces which are like the Arctic.    Everyone could afford electricity in the pre-Liberal days. Now look at Hydro. The Liberals are 'privatizing' it and washing their hands of the mess they created. The new owners will get the increases in rates they ask for, or the province will risk a breakdown in the grid and total chaos.  Merry Christmas.	0

Trump will be worst for the country if he is elected. For one thing, he is appealing to the worst of Americans, the racists, the homophobes, the bigots, the nativists, the misogynists, the religious right that sought to ram their beliefs down our throat.  He will not respect the civil rights and will not protect the workers, consumers and the environment. His tax plan will benefit the wealthy more than the middle class.  He considers Vladimir Putin a like-minded buddy, and that is dangerous to the democratic countries on and near Russia's border. He will not help those countries if Putin takes advantage of Trump's indifference and invades them.	0
Canadians don't have lots of children (or any children) for a variety of reasons. One big reason is the lack of financial security paired with the high cost of living. If governments at any level and of any political stripe would just focus on getting the economy in better shape (without turning our country into a toxic waste dump), and ensuring that all Canadians get the education they need, that no one falls through the cracks, people have good jobs, and we increase our productivity, maybe people would feel more secure and willing to raise families (& I don't mean large families). Bringing more people into Canada, of which only a small percentage are productive and will actually succeed, makes no sense. Focus on those who are already here. We have way too many marginalized and unemployed youth, plus our First Nations people must be considered.	0
Perhaps the fact that US crude and product inventory is down 35 mmbbls over the last five weeks bears might be relative ....perhaps the world is waking up to government endorsement/spending on solar/wind which they deemed justifiable without doing any math on the $ cost. CO2 tonne saved and the implications of the Paris Accord that,,you guessed it,they signed without doing any math.  Ontario/Quebec/ California etal EV refunds have an $250 to $500 tonne CO2 reduction price tag.  Paris Accord calls for a 7.3 billion tonnes of CO2 reduction PER YEAR  by 2030.... 7.3 billion times even $250 is a massive $ amount and it needs to be spent year after year after year. 2009 sub prime write down was a ONE TIME write down of only $ 2 trillion. For the American voters reading this, be thankful that Tillerson and Trump have your P/A back covered...and remember that AL GORE is front and center lead man  driving force behind solar/wind.

Fact: The entire top is not a burial ground, else you would have found iwi on the TMT site.  None were.  Fact: It is not a cultural conservation district, it is simply a conservation district for which the State of Hawaii can and has leased for things other than Hawaiian cultural practices but can include those as well.  Fact: It is public land owned by the state, and while Native Hawaiians may have some allowances there, it does not give them the right to have an exclusive veto over the land for religious or other reasons.  That would violate the US Constitution by giving the a single group of people a religious claim over public land.  I challenge you to point to where in law the land can only be used for cultural purposes.  Fact: No one has convincingly demonstrated how the TMT will harm cultural practices.  Fact: The economic impact of telescopes is real, not hypothetical.  Read the UHERO report: http://www.uhero.hawaii.edu/assets/UHERO_Astronomy_Final.pdf .	0

We used to be able to afford to incarcerate lots of bad guys by outsourcing them to the L48, because it was cheap.  But then we had this great idea to build Goose Creek prison, and greatly increase the cost of incarcerating prisoners.  But now we are hurting for money and too self-serving and dumb to shut down Goose Creek and outsource the prisoners out of state.  So what do we do instead?  We let bad guys wander around wherever they want to go.  Welcome to the new paradigm for criminals, where punishment is not part of the equation.	0
"I don't see why a specific age needs to enter into consideration at all.  If as a society we want to make a noticeable dent in the number of deaths and serious injuries due to motor vehicle accidents - and to heck with unintended consequences - then we should mandate a pass/fail timed test on a driving simulator for all new driver's license applicants and those drivers up for renewal.  There should be just one ""second chance"" permitted and no appeal for life.   The question is, could most of us live with and be comfortable imposing a LIFETIME license ban or revocation for anyone who fails, be they 18 years of age or 100?  There's little doubt this scheme will decrease the number of serious accidents but implementing it really comes down to how many injuries or deaths society implicitly feels is unacceptable.  We're far from reaching that threshold.   I don't care how young or old you are.  If you're physically or mentally unable to safely operate ANY motor vehicle, then you shouldn't."	0

We tried to stop him and my sister even took him to court to keep him and the rest of the world safe from his antics. We failed and the court ruled in his favor. Everybody knew he was lying about his behavior, but even with dementia he is ruled as competent. He kept right on driving vey badly almost until the end. We had to bail him out of so many stupid situations. Caregivers kept trying to tell us to ""force"" him to stop doing this or that knowing we couldn't. It fractured our family.

Albertans didn't become socialists or NDP supporters over a long period of time. Alberta's situation was unique in May, 2015. Albertans were fed up with the P.C.s who made a mess of the fiscal situation and only promised more of the same. The P.C.s had become too flabby and too comfortable in power. The late Jim Prentice struck a sour note in the televised debate where he appeared to belittle Rachel Notley because she was a woman. The present debt situation in Alberta wouldn't be much different if the P.C.s had won because, with industry in deep decline, its up to the government to keep the economy running.	0

But since you know what's going on , maybe you can help me understand :  since hockey in losing , still draws more fans than all the other sports---why were they excluded from the new arena ? Had they been moved to that location their attendance would be even higher.

He choose not to and we're still stuck in permanent war there. He allowed Clinton to talk him into waging war on Libya.   He has pushed the TPP trade deal that the left wing of his party does not want. Clinton supported that until Sanders started pushing back. Obama and Clinton have supported a dysfunctional health insurance system that subsidizes insurance companies with our taxes, instead of a much more efficient single payer system like other rich democracies have.

"You lost me at ""rolling brownouts"" Pete.  Disingenuous at best.  Southcentral (read Anchorage) never had them.  As a State microwave system tech I did, however, see them in Golden Valley's (read Fairbanks) service area via telemetry.

Fairbanks has and always has had, an access problem to low cost energy, trapped between two sources, Cook Inlet and Prudhoe with few options to access them.  That's changing these days but has little to do with cash incentives.  Bottom line is that we can't afford to essentially pay the producers to be as profitable as they are while we are running a massive deficit.

I just presumed that anything an opponent calls a lie is one and then went on to explain why I think that is irrelevant to many of the Trump supporters.  They expect to get lied to; they expect one side to call the other side liars.  It has been going on that way for decades between the establishment candidates.   Even if Trump is lying to them, they expect it.    If he isn't lying to them, they expect his opponents to say he is lying.  That's the way politics is conducted (particularly at the national level) in the United States and has been for decades.  At least as far back as Clinton's impeachment for lying in the Jennifer Flowers case.  And in the Nixon years and all the years in between.	0

"I hope that others near Mr. Trump can show him what bigotry is and what it means.  There is already some pressure on him to fire another source of it in his White House-- Steve Bannon.  Bannon recently said we can not populate OUR country with ""other peoples babies.""  What is this other than hatred and bigotry from one of Trumps high advisers? Every one in America, except the Indians, ARE indeed part of other peoples babies.  Seventyfive years ago others that we looked down on were blacks, Italians and Irish, not to speak of native Americans.  I think it is time to stop proceeding in the way of the old South African regimes.  Trump is the man that feels successful when he makes a deal.  It does not matter if it is a deal to sell billions of arms to Saudi Arabia or to make baking arrangement with Russian oligarchs.  So if others could help him make better deals perhaps he will not be an utter disaster..  Then perhaps his narcissism will be used to make good deals..."	1
"Hughe:  I've been around football all my life...chiefly as a fan.  You're right is it pretty barbaric at all levels.  The goal is NOT to intentionally injure someone (unless you played for the Saints), but injuuries are ""part of the game,"" and most of the former college players I know walk with a limp.  The expanding studies of concussions show us how serious those injuries can be.  Put very simply, you're right....it's a brutal, barbaric game.  Meanwhile, it's also a very large part of American ""culture,"" and a multi-billion dollar industry.  College football, of course, has surpassed the NFL in terms of total revenues and fan base.  Non-athlete kids do actually choose what college to attend based, among other factors, on the success of the school's football teamj...I know, that's a rather sad state of affairs..but it's true.

I read somewhere in the lower 48 that communities were building small single dwellings 20'x20 (?) that included a little kitchen and bathroom area and allowing homeless individuals to live in it free; the cost of the dwelling was peanuts compared to the cost to the community for food kitchen, hosptilization, arrest and incarceration for various related crimes (panhandling, loitering, trespassing, and then some).

"NK fired an intermediate ballistic missile over Japan's island Hokkaido but that wasn't a provocation? NK just exploded a reported hydrogen bomb between 70 to 100 kilotons (Japan cited the former; SK the latter) but that doesn't represent an existential threat? NK has fired a half-dozen missiles into Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone over the past year. NK launched an ICBM in July that has the range to reach Chicago, Denver, LA, Seattle, etc. In early-2016, NK launched an ICBM from a submarine. NK exploded nuclear weapons on 10/06; 5/09; 2/13; 1/16; 9/16; and now 9/17. NK went from a 1-kt weapon to 70+-kt in 11 years. The last weapon is 8 times stronger than the Hiroshima atomic bomb.  NK is rapidly developing the re-entry vehicle to deliver nuclear warheads on an ICBM. KJU has habitually threatened to ""annihilate the U.S."" KJU desires war.

Something that’s not well understood here: gliding in neutral does not save gas!  When the car is in gear and your foot is off the accelerator, fuel delivery goes to 0, the engine is turned by the car’s inertia.

"The First Amendment grants a right of the people to assemble while the Second Amendment grants the right to bear arms.  Both these rights are subject to interpretation because of the way they are written and interpretation is the job of the Supreme Court.  For example, the right to assemble is mentioned in the context of petitioning the government and the right to bear arms is mentioned in the context of use of those arms to support the militia.  The Court has ruled the right to bear arms is an individual right yet there is not an unlimited ""right"" to bear arms.   Is there a similar limit on the right to assembly?   Perhaps the Supreme Court could rule if the right to assemble is only intended for political purpose while the right to bear these defacto machine guns with high capacity magazines (which are legal) ""trumps"" (no pun intended) the right to peacefully assemble for other purpose (including a concert) without undue fear of death or serious injury  - or should we all stay home?"	0

ohttp://www.borgenmagazine.com/9-quotes-from-Jesus-on-why-we-must-help-the-poor/  It's hard to know if posting such a link will serve the purpose I hope.

Many political liberals are morally/ethically shaped by Christian traditions and text.    Many others find these basic truths about life, (compassion is good), through sources other than a religious text or, church pew.    I'd hope for both groups to acknowledge common  values should be celebrated, not used to drive division.    So I offer these quotes from a human Jesus.	0

"Very strange. I wonder what she expects the city to do about this? Treatment for the mentally ill in Oregon has been underfunded for a long time, largely because middle-class people are not willing to pay the taxes that are required to fund treatment programs. They are also not willing to fund homeless shelter. Providing managed shelter for the mentally ill, a fraction of the homeless, would go a long way towards preventing episodes like this. Is Johnson ""compassionate"" enough to pay for more services like Cahoots? There is not much the police can do about the mentally ill. Jails are not mental treatment institutions."	0

Investors and governments hoping to get product to Asian markets with investments in pipeline have a world of hurt coming their way with a way short a market window to payback.

"A few things came to mind as I was reading this opinion piece: One of the best decisions I ever made was volunteering as a mentor 7 years ago for at-risk youth and women transitioning from prison.

"Yes, except... There's a recent paper in the CanadianMedical Association Journal entitled ""Euthanasia in Belgium: trends in reported cases between 2003 and 2013"". You should read it. In Belgium, it became legal in 2002 for a physician to end a patient's life intentionally, if the patient requested it explicitly. In the first year after the law was enacted, there were 250 instances of euthanasia in Belgium. In 2013, the most recent year for which statistics have been published, there were 1800 instances. I crunched the numbers a bit, and it turns out the number of authanasia deaths in Belgium has increased at a thrid-degree polynomial rate -- i.e. proportional to the third power of time. The article states ""The rate of euthanasia increased significantly among those aged 80 years or older, those who died in a nursing home, those with a disease other than cancer, and those not expected to die in the near future."" So, there's some evidence. This slope is slippery."	0

I asked how he did it and what he did with the bodies. He shot both of them, he said, and wrapped their bodies in a gillnet's leadline and sunk them to the bottom of the river. He had been jailed on another charge just to get him off the street. There was nothing I could do or say, so I kept it to myself for about 30-years. I don't know whatever happened to him. Probably died in prison. Sometimes that's how journalism works. It has rules.	0
Every culture develops technology that suits its purpose and enhances living.  The examples you have chosen (some of which most certainly were developed among First Nations) are simply your own imposition of order on the universe.

It's just a  classificatory system you were taught in school and one that, not surprisingly, favours your world view over that of others.

"Translation: Trump may win the Republican nomination. There is even a small chance he will be the next President. He hates much of the present Republican establishment and would demolish it. He isn't totally on board as far as unthinking support of Israel. He is bringing on board the thoughts and needs of the very low income blue collar Republicans, people who are not regarding highly by the super rich. He supports those in border states.   Bush is out, Rubio is in charge.  Sure, what is said here in this article is rational and reasonable. Saying ""Trump’s GOP is a rear-window party pining for a white America that never is coming back"" pretty much tosses those blue collar workers under the bus. I will be voting for Bernie, but even I recognize what is happening.  The billionaire vote is terrified of their own base, who could cost them both the Senate and the Presidency. So that base is now fair game. The support for Rubio is now mandatory.  Hugh Massengill, Eugene"	0

Hopefully there is a tipping point where enough parents are demanding the school and their kids perform that the schools turn the corner and graduation and college acceptance rates rise.	0
No other options? You're not serious, right? The government didn't have to settle. If this matter was so crucial to defending the Charter rights of Canadians it should have been litigated to the end. A couple decades ago I read a piece, written by a lawyer I believe, who noted that the Charter would mean little to ordinary Canadians until a sufficient body of Charter-related precedents emerged. In the meantime, precious few Charter-related civil damages claims have made it through the court system. The facts in Khadr would likely have led to a decision that would establish important precedents, so why did the Trudeau government circumvent the legal process? For money? Saving your tax dollars isn't generally seen as its top concern.	0

Your political analysis is spot on as usual. Normally Im with you, but Stephen I think your being a bit of an a$$. These communities are small and these murders are hitting close to home. Are their lives more important than the other 1000's that got murdered over the year? No. However the psychological effects of having someone murdered in a community of 50 and a city of millions are worlds apart.   These people are scared. There is no safety, there is no security, there is no government to help, there is no police, no big brother to help in their plight, there is nothing. You know what happens when people are scared they try to find something, anything to hold on to.  Yes some idiots tried to foster support for their old misguided delusional pre-94 days, and most of the people protesting are not super hard core freedom fighters. They just want to be able to make a living and have a future in the country they call home.   This is sensitive.	1

I've read the first thirty comments and wonder if they reflect mostly ignorance or mostly fear. Donald Trump does not understand climate change so I am hoping Hilary Clinton wins the election and quickly begins education programs and discussions about how to proceed. Possible topics: rationing carbon; lowering speed limits on highways as happened in the 1970's oil crisis; reductions in air travel; fairness in distributing the burden of reducing carbon; the mitigation (income, healthcare guarantees) of effects of ending coal mining (and similar industries) on communities and processes left behind (e.g. aluminum and steel production); more efficient manufacturing and distribution of all goods; guarantees of food and water to all citizens as the climate deteriorates; the need to do this and more before its too late and we lose our freedoms to the force needed to reduce carbon use to save our very lives. Many scientists believe the Paris agreement is an inadequate drop in the bucket.	0

When the Liberals won in 2001, the NDP was decimated to 2 seats.  ""By convention"", they should have been delegated official party status, but BC Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell threw convention aside and refuse to grant them official party status. .

"""Do you think the Native Hawaiian community was advanced when OHA had kanaka maoli arrested outside of the country club during the failed attempt to create a fake tribe?""  I was there, but OHA was not.  The golf course had them arrested for trespassing on private property.  That is, of course, what they wanted all along.  They had nothing substantive or consequential to offer us.  They just wanted to get on a bullhorn and scream senseless nonsense to attract attention to their intellectually bankrupt cause.  Sorry, but we have no obligation whatsoever to listen to nonsense and idiocy.  The long and short of it is this:  There is no plan for Hawaiian ""independence.""  None whatsoever.  There are only mentally unstable people telling war stories around campfires and reminiscing about the past.  That's it.  They have no realistic way of ever achieving their goals (if they actually have any in life).  Why should we entertain your non-plan?  That's a waste of time."	1
"What hypocrisy!  The Roman Church has been in the relic selling business for centuries.  For a fee, the ""faithful"" can part of the body of a saint/martyr.  Often, a tiny piece of bone.  Now if that isn't scattering body parts, how does it differ from scattering ashes?  An Irish jounalist, Liam Collins, reduced the church's argument to rubble,  “appears to have teams of under-employed civil servants with nothing better to do than dream up new ways to torment the faithful.”   Male clerics with too much time on their hands & nothing constructive to do.  Again, the curia can  be reformed but need to be removed all together.  Scattered like ashes in the direction of their origins."	1

As someone who rented a bike in Copenhagen when I was there for meetings I have to say I was unimpressed. The lanes in the centre are separated from the cars but this makes it extremely hard to overtake slower cyclists. The result is that cycling through the centre is slow and it is the only place where I have bee stuck in a cycle traffic jam - three light changes to get through a junction - because the organization of the bike lanes is so poor.  It is also far harder to cycle in Canada in the winter because of the snow and ice. Unlike cars, which are far more stable due to having four wheels, bikes are lethal on slippery ground as I found out as a student in the UK. If you want to look at a bike friendly city try Cambridge in the UK - it is far better than Copenhagen.	0

I'm skeptical of this psychology research into teaching evaluation ratings. It also doesn't help that this article doesn't elaborate on the general methodology of that research. I think that having a correlation between racial minority/female and lower teaching outcome offers limited insight. It would be more meaningful if the study had an auditor to evaluate the instructor against the students average ratings. In particular, instructors of color who have a thick accent or struggle to speak clearly shouldn't be included in the study for bias as their ratings would be lower because of their poor communication skills. In my own experience as an engineering student, I strongly question the role of bias in a student's perception simply because the material is so hard that most could care less what the instructor looks like. Professors who can effectively explain difficult concepts clearly, are highly respected and valued by students. Speaking of bias, couldn't research be biased?	0

NATO exists only because of American funding and military might, without American participation, NATO will collapse. Who will Canada look to for a military friend next, China, North Korea perhaps?? Better bulk up, arm up and pull your weight from now on. Sometimes it takes a shock to the system for all these weak kneed Canadian pacifist politicians and desk generals and bureaucrats to wake up.

It's is probably more common than you realize having experience and still screwing up.  My ex was in the AF and his job was combat arms training and maintenance (CATM).  He was emptying out his gun one day, but got distracted.  He thought he had cleared his weapon and so he fired the gun pointing at the car.  The bullet ricocheted off the trunk and out the window in the direction of people standing outside.  One of his fellow CATM members once thought he had cleared his weapon and so pulled the trigger.  He was in his truck and I think he shot his radio.  You'd think an AF Cop would know how to drive, but one hit me on Elmendorf AFB causing $5k in damage.  Military can be very stupid too.	1

CS, read my reply to Randy Galt. In addition I would point out that Kansas isn't in the top ten states for oil production. Texas and California are, and they both have among the fastest growing state economies. However, both states have huge, diversified economies. North Dakota is third in oil production by state and similar in agricultural production to Kansas. In 2015 its GDP shrank .2% owing to the drop in oil prices; however, the year before it rose over 6%, while Kansas was still +0.2%.   http://247wallst.com/special-report/2016/06/16/states-with-the-fastest-and-slowest-growing-economies-2/5/  Including 2015, in the last five years the ND GDP grew over 21% for a compound GDP growth rate of just over 4% annual. All non-petroleum activity in ND is less than half of total GDP.   http://www.deptofnumbers.com/gdp/north-dakota/  Kansas oil production last year was just under 38 MM BBL, about 10% of ND production. top-of-head calculation puts oil at about 10% of the Kansas economy.	0

Hmm, many admirable goals.   The one I didn't see was a commitment to full employment and attracting jobs for full time employees.      To the positive, education, recreation, great utilities, great infrastructure are the major influence for high wage companies.     Poor primary education scores will devalue the larger community/state.  There are certainly bounderies for what city government can do independently.   But a goal of creating strong middle wages, that allow one person to sustain a family of 4, would provide a foundation security and safer environment for children - the next generation of Eugene's leadership.  There's no shame in a liberal acknowledging the economic status of the community and setting goals to sustain the local community.  Safety and health, positive goals, will require funding.	0

Cannabis CAN grow up to 4 meters tall but that same cannabis plant can be induced to maturity at as little as 6 inches tall or any height in between.   Cannabis is photoperiodic.

Another legacy from the Robber Baron(s) days to continue to kill wildlife and human life from toxic residue fouling the water supplies all the way to the Pacific Ocean from one small area of the Rocky Mountains.  The disaster waiting to happen from the Berkeley Pit as the government and the current owners dither and dally for years is only one earthquake away from poisoning an area from Montana to Washington.  All efforts have been bandaids on a festering sore stretching across ecological and geographical boundaries.  Just one of many found throughout the Northwest from that great pioneering era resulting in the Oil and Mining Trusts ruling the nation and much of the world.  Their legacy lives on in Wall Street as their inheritors carry on their greed-driven goals of world domination.

How would it work if the social service agencies who are responsible for working with the homeless : mental health, substance abuse treatment, homeless shelters, Alaska Native Tribal service workers, various charities (including churches) have their employees/volunteers going INTO the homeless camps  together, 24/7 ? They could develop a plan to work in teams to do onsite out-reach with the goal being getting the homeless hooked into the services they need and taking them to homeless shelters.  How about making public, what every social service agency, charity, city and state agencies, actually do ?	0

Congress is sharply divided on this issue (as is the whole country).  It is time for both sides to recognize the pressing need for bipartisan resolution.    It's a simple compromise:  DACA stays...in exchange for...Congress funds The Wall.    It's not hard.  BOTH sides have to give something here. Democrats must put aside their hate for Trump, and Republicans must put aside their rigid ideology.  Both parties need to get off their righteous argumentative, spoiled butts and make the deal.	0
"Which ""activists"" are you thinking about?  The Republican activists?  The oil-industry activists?  The social conservative activists?  The activists who care about the practice of democracy?  There IS a complaint to Elections Canada from a losing conservative candidate that makes allegations of foreign money, but it does not seem that there is much evidence provided to back up the allegation.  By the way, accusing the media of being complicit, without having something factual to show that they are ignoring (or hiding) the issue, is called smearing.     However if the influence of money on our political process of concern to you, let's ask that all contributions and donations to all parties be required to be publically disclosed, including donor name and identity, date of donation, and amount."	0

"As a liberal-progressive atheist it saddens me to see that the more progressive churches are losing membership as the more rigidly dogmatic churches increase their numbers.    I have always had a warm spot for those theists who live the positive teachings while eschewing literalism and embracing the allegorical approach to the Bible.  I suppose part of the issue is that the more ""spirit-filled"" churches are unafraid to use worship services to elicit ecstatic states in the worshippers while insinuating them with a literalism that finds roots in the fundamentals movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States.    An approach that may work for the liberal-progressive churches could entail eliciting ecstasy in the worshippers without insinuation of literalism.  Literalism and ecstasy are not inseparable, and by showing that these states are not bound to literalism they may afford a path for people who are uncomfortable with fundamentalist dogma."	0

Trump’s continued criticism prompts questions over president's sanity.  There, I fixed the headline.

"If the issue is strictly coal -- as the headline states -- I fail to see how this applies to Canada. Coal is used to produce about 10% of Canada's energy nationally and it is actually only used in four provinces: New Brunswick (13% of energy), Nova Scotia (60%), Saskatchewan (44%) and Alberta (55%). Oddly enough the oil producing provinces don't actually burn much oil for energy. All other provinces rely on other forms of energy. Natural gas is source of about 9% and petroleum about 1%. The balance is nuclear (16%),  water (60%) and ""other""."	0

The much bigger issue is why we allow people to incorporate at all. Historically, the notion of incorporating businesses was motivated by encouraging people to invest in new ventures.

Does this not make it easier for enterprises to make unsound decisions regarding negative externalities?	0

"I been watching more college ball lately and it's true what they say about how the lack of NFL offenses being played in college is hurting player development, especially the linemen and QB's.  Denver drafted these two guys knowing they were ""read option"" types that liked the shotgun and had the ability to extend the plays with their feet. Big transistions for these guys when they hit the NFL. Smith played it at Utah and does ok running it at times, but he'll get drilled someday by a safety or linebacker and get slowed down. I see him sliding more so that's good for him. Russell Wilson is great at it. Osweiler and Lynch are big enough and enjoy the contact of delivering the blow first, but they need to learn first off how to slide too and extend their career. Since so many of these young QB's are playing this way, guys like McCoy need to plan for this especially when the GM of the team is drafting them in my opinion. Didn't make sense to me in training camp to be fitting two opposites."	0

Haha.  If you had read my comment, you'd have realized that my criticism is, first, about the level of discourse around food choices.   Writing a complainy article by a meat-eater about how faux-meats taste isn't really discussing the real food issues.  Where is the discussion about the cruelty inherent in the animal products industry?  Where is the discussion on the climate change impact?  Where is the discussion on health?  This is the role of the media, to challenge readers to view issues from a different perspective.  Second, you miss the entire point that your palate is influenced by what you eat.  The author completely missed that fact.  How can a reasonable food critic not understand that?  Faux meats have a place in the world, not because they're perfect replicas but because they fill a need.  The author should try to understand why vegans love the taste rather than complain because they don't understand the basics of palate anatomy.	0

Long term policies rarely work well with short term thinking. Such is the style of Lane County leaders for the 35 years I have lived here.

Oh for sure, the point of tipping is to encourage/reward better service.  I'm not against tipping as a system.  I'm just referring to how the new law is significantly jacking up the minimum wage, and thus costs to business and prices to consumers.  If our prices are going to jump because those employees are getting paid 70% more in hourly wage, the case justifying big tips goes down.  The new law applies to tip-jobs too.  The tip-job minimum wage is going from $5.29 last year to $8.98 by 2020.

SB 21 was aimed at supporting the majors and harming the Alaskans and smaller oil & gas competitors, it took away incentives from the smaller companies and made sure the majors got paid and the small competitors got hit with Walkers $620 worth of vetoes that helped eliminate competition for the majors!.  Walker needs to pay the $620 Million owed on the vetoed credits, it has been on the backs the smaller oil and gas companies and not the majors!   SB 21 had more tricks in it then the smaller companies knew at the time but Savant, Armstrong, Pioneer Resources joined me in fighting the bad in SB 21.  Alaska needs to stop pricing Alaskans and smaller competitors out of the oil & gas business with massive red tape and realize the $60 Billion in the Permanent fund came from oil so stop the panic and pay the $3 billion out of the $60 B right?

"A DBA is not a public business, it is a private business open to the public. It is owned by an individual and typically filed with the IRS using the owners SSN.

Deficits out until 2050 is unacceptable. I also can't see how the (federal) debt is paid by 2060 unless there is a tax grab on estates of boomers, including principal residences.   At one time, governments tried to balance a budget in the good years (and even pay down some debt), and leave deficits for downturn years. (Harper ran deficits until his final year of office). Now it seems politicians aim to balance the budget in election years  only.  Taking on more debt as an acceptable % of growing GDP will  not lead to spending cuts when the economy contracts in recession years. Ontario  continues to expand spending while selling off assets to balance -  a shortsighted approach. We should have  budget offices operate  like the US congressional budget office that costs out spending programs before they are legislated, and also looks for offset cuts at the same time.	0
"You missed my point-- the point is the SCOTUS is looking at protecting the rights of US citizens under their decision to allow Trump's ban with limits. That means protecting the rights of US Citizens or legal residents under the US constitution. Non citizens and non legal residents do not have constitutional rights (except possibly under very rare circumstances). The constitutional rights of a citizen or legal resident could include hiring immigrants without unconstitutional bars such as religion (a US Citizen could have a constitutional right to hire a Muslim), or for a US Citizen to have their spouse immigrate to the US even if they are Muslims, or to have your child immigrate free of discrimination (assuming they are not in violation of other laws or rules-- immigration fraud, criminal violations, being a terrorist, etc.). Therefore, the SCOTUS order striking down Trump's ban had this ""connection"" provision to protect US Citizens and legal residents."	0

Uh, no. . Boeing built itself as a private corporation.  It gained its 40 year dominance in commercial aviation because it bet the company on a large, four-engine long range aircraft that then occupied a situational monopoly until the A380 came along.

"Being a mother is the hardest job in the world, bar none. New mothers should have every possible support available to them at all times.  Sadly, we have a government that says the words ""families first"" but when it comes to decision making, all they are interested in is whether the action they take will win them votes, and whether it will cost them money they'd rather funnel to their supporters through tax breaks. Bottom line, when a mother comes forward saying she's depressed or having a difficult time, she should be met with open arms and undivided attention, despite the cost. Then and only then will we have ""families first"" in this province."	0
"""1 in 5 cases"" is four million cases a year!    Again, gloves are not a panacea.  But what I really disagree with is the assumption that the proposed rule is based merely on evidence-free wishful thinking by ignorant government do-gooders.  There are actually food safety professionals who study the transmission of food-borne illness and measures to decrease it, such as wearing gloves.  Yes, hand washing is absolutely essential, but consider this analysis in a food safety publication:  ""There are important parts of the hand that are typically missed during the hand washing process. Thumbs, palms, spaces between fingers and fingertips, including the fingernail area, are areas where contamination is most likely to remain. The nail region presents special problems because more than 95% of hand flora resides in these areas.""  (I've omitted the more graphic descriptions of the problem, but you can probably imagine the general idea.)"	0

Not surprising, the Greens backing the BC Liberals would be political suicide.  While not overly happy myself, I expected this.  That being said the party has a razor thin majority meaning they can fall at any point.  Otherwise I would be shocked if this makes 4 years, but I do believe it will last a year as the BC Liberals know full well they bring down the government in the next year they will pay for it.  My advice to Clark is don't even try a throne speech just resign gracefully, also make sure your party doesn't put up a speaker.  This will mean a 43-43 split in the legislature whereas if they put up a throne speech it will be 42-44 thus more favourable to the NDP.	0
"It isn't evil. You seem to be misinformed.  ""LaVeyan Satanism, holds that Satan does not exist as a literal anthropomorphic entity, but rather as a symbol of a cosmos which Satanists perceive to be permeated and motivated by a force that has been given many names by humans over the course of time. In this religion, ""Satan"" is not viewed or depicted as a hubristic, irrational, and fraudulent creature, but is rather seen as being Prometheus-like in terms of attributes, symbolizing liberty and the like. To adherents, he also serves as a conceptual framework and an external metaphorical projection of the Satanist's highest personal potential. ...Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates. The reality behind Satan is simply the dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things."" -wikipedia  So it's wrong if you believe Jewish prayer for example should be banned also."	0

Sir I am a life long Alaskan, my roots go back three generations in this state prior to big oil, my children are the fourth, so my agenda is Alaskan. It is unfair to say the Wilderness Societies Agenda is UnAlaskan, as if your agenda and the agenda of unfettered development is always in the best interest. Clearly based in the past it is not; if we look at the hostility towards President Carter and ANILCA we can now see he was right in many ways.  If resource development was always in the best interest of the citizens of this state then why do we find our selfs in the present pickle? Untold Billions have been taken from our land, and we still have people living in communities without basic sanitation?   As you know the Alaska Rail Road was built by the Federal Government for the Federal Government, in a territory that they controlled. But in portions of the interior and elsewhere there already were private railroads in operation, paid for by private dollars.	0

In my diocese, parishes provided the convents during the school year, but the sisters were to return to their communities during the summer so that the parishes didn't have to pay for them. Your point #1 has the cart before the horse, I'm afraid. It was the decline in religious vocations for women that led to the closing of schools. Parishes were unwilling or unable to pay the salaries of lay people, which as was noted above are not substantial even today.  I do agree, however, that the absence of religious sisters in schools and parishes has accelerated the decline of religious vocations. The influence and presence is a key factor in planting seeds and without it, few young women are encouraged to consider that vocation.	0

When the state actually started collecting a fair share of our oil production in 2007, the oil companies threw a snit and reneged on this. And what did we do? Nothing. Everyone knew that the increased tanker traffic would mean more accidents. We are humans, after all.  The state is maintaining the Dalton Highway, at our cost, to service the oil companies. Time to turn it into a toll road, to support its maintenance, and to fund the inevitable tanker crashes and cleanups. No more corporate welfare.  Oh, and couple this with a tax on the gross production, not the phony ""net profit"", so that they can't merely pass on the cost back to us."	0

I fully understand the need for reach and distribution that makes companies like this link up with established players. However, the margin requirements for reach will likely reduce the attractiveness of the product to many of us. What should be a straightforward product that is provided at a fixed rate turns into an ad valorem fee that quickly becomes unattractive. My financial advisor offers a rebalancing product, but at 50bp, when the service has nothing to do with the value of the portfolio and thus is very unattractive for any portfolio of even modest size.  Kendra, you might want to focus these clients on things that would really resonate with us: 1.      Fixed price per rebalancing, per security; 2.     Ability to roll-over the existing ETF assets that likely have uncrystallized capital gains;  3.     The ability to tailor the buckets to specific ETF's that work for us, rather than the providers' choices;and 4.      An algorithm that would address itself to after-tax rebalancing	0

I was not referring to property taxes, but a value added tax (VAT) when foreigners purchase a home.  Generally, my experience is that these are upper end homes that they live in or rent as luxury property---hardly something that would affect the lowest income local residents or renters.  In travelling abroad I encountered the VAT in purchasing almost everything.  Oahu real estate escalations vary by neighborhood--I am more familiar with the East Oahu/Manoa areas where prices have really gone up a lot, and purchases by foreigners have increased a lot.  Just go to open houses in the luxury home market and see who shows up and who closes.	0

The problem with the Iraq comparison is that the US was hell bent on attacking Iraq and was looking to manufacture a pretext. That's not the case here.   Perhaps more dangerously, the US strike shows the unpredictability of the Trump administration; a week ago, senior administration officials, and the President himself, were essentially saying that Assad wasn't their problem and that it was up to the Syrian people to work out what happens (yeah right!). Understandably, the Assad regime understood those comments to mean that they had a free hand to do what they would. That's why the gas attack happened.   I'm sure nobody was as surprised as Assad by the about face and, even though the attack was largely theatre, the Assad regime and the Russians must be wondering what's next. I expect the message from the attack is meant to communicate to the Assad regime that it is free to exterminate Syrians using conventional means but that it must refrain from using chemical weapons.	0

Iraj, why aren't you asking the same questions of your boardroom colleagues over acquiescing to what has been going on in the country for a long time, particularly under the Zuma administration - enabling with BEE (and don't say it's legal), eager to be seen to be doing business with the ruling party, kowtowing to their whims and not speaking out as the constitution was eroded and country descended into a political, social and economic no-man's land? The Guptas with their jets, weddings and feting Zuma, ANC and politicians are cause celebre and everyone, except Gupta's supporters, are on the same side and so it's easy to say what you are now and not have repercussions.  But I think you're being disingenuous. Corruption didn't start with the Guptas - it was already there in one form or other since 1994 and your business colleagues, along with the ruling alliance, parceled out the country and economy to serve their own interests. Why are they so quiet now? Because they are all complicit.	0
The Rolling Stone article is preaching to the choir to the extent that their readership likely lean towards the Democratic, possibly Sanders, end of the spectrum. But whatever envy underpins the author's take on the RS piece it effectively reinforces perceptions of JT's sense of entitlement and lack of substance. Interesting to note too that, for the first two years of his mandate JT has had the floor to himself with a place holder leading the opposition and a political eunuch heading the NDP. Now, almost as soon as Scheer showed up, he scored points on Trudeau in the Commons, besting him during the banter of Question period. Now Scheer has made him look foolish over the Khadr payment as well. The Liberals are also running scared on the FN file, having over promised and delivered, um, well, nothing. So while Americans lament their president they should pause to recall that, while Trudeau may be preferable, they are both hot air merchants who value their personal brand above all else.	0
I'm a 17 year veteran teacher in DPS and I've talked extensively with Tay about school board and DPS issues. He knows more about the issues and history of school board elections than almost every other adult  candidate starting out as a potential new school board member. He is a quick study and he is invested and truly concerned more in the student, community and teacher well being that any of the education corporate reform candidates that are presently rubber stamping any and all of Tom Boasberg's privatization agenda. He has created a great deal of local and nation interest and support for his election. Don't be surprised if he wins this or at least makes a statement with his candidacy that the bought and paid for, with out of state and corporate dark money, status quo thinking, has got to go!	0

Whole Foods carries some grass-fed meat and dairy that I haven`t seen anywhere else -- in fact, I think they were the first major food retailer to carry grass-fed milk and really pushed it by discounting for several months.   Whole foods got their hands on Hope Eco buffalo milk products that I haven`t seen anywhere else.     They have grass-fed beef and much better labeling of meat quality than most other stores.    They would do well to continue the shift to the higher end of the food quality spectrum.   They should consider dumping some of the processed  stuff they carry, because some of it is neither organic nor healthy (trans fats, and so on).  There is a gap in the quality prepared food space in downtown and midtown Toronto.   Pusateri`s doesn`t carry much that`s organic and free from additives and, now that `All the Best Fine Foods` is gone`, there is a real lack of some of healthier prepared foods that places like Summerhill Market are too far off the subway line to fill.	0
I suspect Beyak is correct that there were decent and caring people involved in the residential school program, and probably there were students who did benefit from it.    And one might be able to find examples of Nazis who were not malevolent, and dog and cat meat would provide a means of nutrition as well as correct the problem with strays....   But the overall narrative of the residential school program was its intent of cultural assimilation and there were far too many instances of neglect and malevolent abuse.   Beyak may be technically correct, but is blatantly politically naive.	0

"It seems worth noting that the Aggravated Identify Theft counts (17 - 20) against Katherine entail her allegedly forging the signature of an HPD Officer, C.P.M., on 4 different police reports over a period of more than 3 years.  The reports were used to ""explain away [the Kealohas'] poor credit history"" according to the indictment.  These charges seem to underscore the extreme lengths Katherine went to as she committed her crimes over many years.  They also illustrate perfectly how she was able to abuse her and Louis' position as Honolulu's law enforcement ""power couple"" to get away with defrauding vulnerable people. I would think these charges would support an argument to have her detained pending trial, but none of the media reports I've read indicate that the prosecutors made this argument in their attempt to have her detained.  Seems to me that forging a law enforcement officer's signature on a fraudulent police report (or 4) makes Katherine a flight risk."	0
"""That's extortion"" is an interesting accusation for a defence lawyer to put forward in an environment when every duty and almost all of the expense of the criminal court system falls upon the state and the taxpayers that support the state, and every beneficiary is a member of the bar.  Criminals are service demand generators for members of the criminal bar, so those members of the criminal bar have every incentive to string out the process of criminals being brought to justice, even to the point of failure, for failure just launches the criminal back into the world where more crime leads to more demand for services provided by members of the criminal bar.  Leaving any court system without independent oversight gives the 'servants' of that court system a free ride to set the rules by which they extract wealth from others, and that lack of oversight has allowed effective extortion to become the rule, not the exception.    Trouble is, we taxpayers can't find a prosecutor."	0

You do realize the Radir D played the race card first, right? Like he usually does. He has a pattern of racist trolling. A lot of people who have frequented the DP comment section for years recognize this.   Did Trump hire Jeff Sessions because both are white? Racists never ask if white people hired white people because of racial nepotism but their first instinct is to ask if black people were hired because of skin color. Because racists instinctively think black people aren't qualified. It's always a given to the racists that a white guy is always the most qualified and they never question it for a moment. White racial nepotism is the oldest play in the good ol' boy playbook. White preferences are the original affirmative action and they're still the most common type of preferences. Many white people would be collecting cans from garbage cans if they weren't benefited by white preferences.	0

Indeed, and I say this half in jest all in earnest,  in the American marketplace, an argument for an abortion ban might be more effective if it was accompanied by an argument for expanded availability of contraception.   The ""immoral equivalence"" of abortion and contraception does weaken the pro-life cause for many."	0

I am not a Trump fan, but people in glass houses should not throw stones. When foreign governments, donate money to American charities, it does not take an extremely high IQ to know they are not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts, especially when the founder turns around and brazenly does them favors. It also does not take a genius to question how a couple of career politicians became multi-millionaires in such a short period of time. The only difference between the two, is apparently Hillary manages her dirty money better than the Donald.	0

I was doubtful that bike share would take off when I started to see it arrive in many cities. I was wrong. I hope it works for our community. There will be problems which will be reported and jumped on as evidence the entire project is failing. Let's see what happens. Getting people to walk or bike in an infrastructure is an huge challenge. We've created an environment that works against including exercise as part of living. Sure, not everyone can exercise, but people should be able to burn some calories if they want. Parents are afraid of letting kids walk to school. Women are fearful of walking at night alone. Most of the population is overweight and evidently burning fewer calories than they consume.  Walking: a method of transportation proven useful for 3 million years.	0

So basically what you're saying is in exchange for what many feel is a right to health care you want to be able to run people's lives? I suffered a back injury many years ago and I put on weight because it hurt to move. Should I have lost my health care because of my injury? I think the real problem here is outlined pretty well in the article..the cost of health care is insane. They don't just want to show a profit, they want to show an insane profit. I worked so that my family could have health care, but I was lucky enough to find a job with benefits. That is hard...many of the biggest employers only hire part time so they don't have to provide it. I think the article is well written and it's just too bad that the politicians don't realize if they do this they will go down in history as heroes.	0

If they really cared about healthcare for their population, shouldnt they have been working on one for the last 7 years?  And how can you put forward a plan that takes away from so many as opposed to give?	0

My guess is that you don't remember how the former Mayor said rail would be a traffic solution, which turned into a TOD project which then morphed into a ""Jobs"" project.  Not to mention on how it was also sold on only costing a certain amount to be paid for with a tax that would end by a certain year which all of a sudden became more expensive after an election.   The point being made is what's written in the EIS isn't how it was told to the public to garner support for this rail project."	0

That is just lost taxes, that does not count the cost of all the benefits,[medical/welfare/housing/schools and the like] that they illegally consume or in some cases have been given although it is illegal to do so. The cost of illegal immigration is way to high and the quality of the immigrants cannot be controlled if the illegals are allowed to remain. America needs and wants legal immigrants who want to come here to work, live and raise their families and most important to become an actually part of the American dream by learning to read, write and speak the native language english. How can anyone exist without that ability? Cant drive, read papers for news or jobs, go to school even go shopping, everything is in english except in certain areas catering to foreign language speakers.

There are good and solid reasons why the Canadian economy is doing so much better for most people than the US economy - the Canadian government is mostly benign and working for Canadian citizens, unlike the predatory and corrupt US government, owned as it is by corporate interests and working for them. The Canadian financial system preserves the separation of the ""three pillars"" of Insurance, banking, and Investment firms, unlike the USA, which Under Clinton eliminated Glass-Steagall and permitted an orgy of financial chicanery with government-guaranteed deposits that directly resulted in the meltdown of 2008.

So, Andersen's reg season, done, won't play tonight.  Check his #s, 2.67 GAA, .918 save %.  And his last 4 games, not good.  He had little to do with Your Leafs improved season; that was due to scoring a lot more than last season, GAA was almost constant this season to last, just marginally better.  His is, to repeat, OK, nothing special.  He ranks only hundredths of % ahead of both Reimer and Bernier this season, all middle of the pack.  1 played for a better team, 1 for a worse team, so it cannot be the team each of Bernier and Reimer played for.  Not the team.  If you look up Reimer's #s with Your Leafs a season ago, exact same save %, GAA superior.  Conclusion?  Andersen is Reimer.  I mean, it's not even really arguable, all the data leads to that 1 finding.	0

"Eugene is too rich,  provides too many opportunities,   thus attracts the scrounge or steal element.  At least 20 years ago,  an Oregonian columnist,  headed for Bend,   stopped at the  coffee kiosk in Idanah,  just east of Detroit on Hiway 22.  He asked the vendor how things were going,  perhaps not knowing Stuckart had shut down his  mill,  and Green Veneer was shuttered,  and the US Plywood site had been razed.  The vendor said that there is no work,  but there  had been a little improvement recently:    ""The crank  heads have left town because there is nothing left to steal.""     When there is nothing left to steal,  the problem children will move on.  That is what you have to  look forward to.

Pro:  The House coalition is doing something, as compared to the non-productive sessions the last two years.  Much debate is forthcoming.  The legislature's 'single subject rule' defeats efforts to move forward to a balanced budget; it has a confusing effect on the Body and the general public.  Alaska needs a comprehensive approach based upon fairness to all end users.  The budget needs cuts to oil tax credits, and general fund state spending.  A 'right sized' government needs to equal annual revenues.  In addition, the state needs to increase revenue streams however it can.  And, the Body needs to stay away from any permanent restructuring of the PFD or it's funding formula.  Do not let the legislature break into the peoples piggy bank.  It has no record of fiscal restraint; in fact, it's record is just the opposite.  Everyone knows that.	0

How is Pope Francis responsible for what is happening to women in Cuba? Ask the Cuba government what is happening to women in Cuba. I agree with you by the way that much has to change in the Catholic Church on women, particularly on the issue of women's ordination which i support.   What Sister Christine Schenk is saying however is that there have already been positive steps taken in the first place, and she and others like Sister Simone Campbell would know having had to fight patriarchal policies in the Catholic Church for years. And she gave specific examples of what Pope Francis is doing. You're snarky dismissiveness is not only dismissive of the Pope or the Church, but dismissive of the experiences of women like Sister Christine who you allege you advocate for.   Finally it should be noted that women in Global Christianity and Catholicism are more likely to be religious and stay in the faith than men are. Especially in the developing world.	0

Our experiences and observations may be different, but I respect your opinion.....and glad you liked my attempt at humour!  This is exactly the kind of respectful debate that this forum should be about.  Keep it up.  I do agree that there are plenty of wingnuts on the far left that want to curb freedom of expression through their own version of Newspeak and by shouting down intelligent dissent.  I saw it in university in the 80s and it seems to be getting worse (the pronoun warriors who object to he and she, for example).  And those who use violence while protesting are beneath contempt.  But the far right loonytunes are also still alive and kicking.  I have little respect for either of the extremes, personally.	0
From what I see the doctors can avoid the extra tax hit by changing the structure of their CCPC's. They may even have to drop this type of professional corporation altogether.

B yard:  I have long been an advocate for a carefully crafted, progressively written sales tax.  With exemptions on food and sensible tax credits for low income workers, a sales tax could really make sense.  Of course, with the history of defeats, one would be a very hard sell.  It will be interesting to see how it goes.  regards, Gary	0
believe sword might be wrong insofar as the settlement payment to the chief.  as I understand the payment is to settle all the actions and claims between the chief and the city so no further actions can be taken by the chief or the city once the settlement agreement is signed.  Hence, the city council should approve the settlement.  whenever the city is sued by employees, third parties, etc. any settlement agreement is reviewed and approved by the city council and this settlement is no different.	0

@Ak49er: The VA is not an appropriate example to support your argument because that was not the problem for the VA.  The single-payer system you describe is the exact same one we use to pay for all of our public services, from schools to roads to libraries to police to firefighters to the military, and every public agency there is.  The conclusion of your arguments against a single-payer system is that the United States is not capable of doing what almost the entire rest of the world has and does manage to do.	0

"Actually nursing is starting to attract quite a few men and schools are filled with male teachers.  If you want to place blame for the lack of men in traditional women fields (like nursing and teaching) you need only look to a culture that has historically relegated the value of women to being mother's and wives and belittled their endeavours. A prime example is the posters on this forum who denigrate the PM by referring to him as Justine. The reason men haven't been drawn in large numbers to those careers is because they were viewed negatively as ""women's work"" and historically the women in those jobs were paid less. Now those jobs are being better compensated and surprise surprise you are starting to see an increase in men in those roles. It takes time however for societal expectations to change. The more we move away from stereotyping roles for men and women the less you will see gender imbalances in the workforce."	0
I remember one Christmas day in Korea.  It was snowing and I was walking home after meeting with my college friends and exchanged small gifts.

Hello Creator,  You asked about the merit of your Charter comment. I will defer to lawyers on that one. But Canadian law has forbidden buying and owning ALL SORTS OF ENTITIES over the years (assault weapons, handguns, ivory, South African gold coins, elephant leather, stuffed endangered parrots, etc etc etc etc) and so, in the first place, the law that gets the folks in question incarcerated could be as simple as adding heroin to that mentioned list of recent decades and, if the Supreme Court later rules a Charter violation, that can be over-ride treated using the notwithstanding clause. Voila, the new program exists.	0

Murkowski's complaint about ANWR becoming a monument has little to no connection with the residents of the islands wanting a sanctuary around their homes and requesting one. An ANWR monument would not violate ANILCA because ANILCA specifically exempted areas set aside prior to 1980. ANWR was set aside in 1960. Further, the 'no more clause' in ANILCA would not survive close examination by the courts, who have held since 1920 that large monuments are permitted, and that the size of the monument is the presidents call. Monuments in ANWR and Bristol Bay will be upheld, under Supreme Court precedent, and the fact AK has no standing to challenge any monuments in its borders , under Alaska vs Carter (1980). It is the courts, not Congress, that determine the legality of actions by the presidents, in the case of monuments, the courts have upheld every monument ever challenged, including all 17 of Carters. Likewise any monuments Obama creates will be upheld.	0

It wasn't a question, Trump stated outright that there was an illegal wiretap, and that a court had refused to issue a warrant for it.  So the fact that Comey found no trace of a wiretap that was applied for and denied already disproves Trump's accusation.  If it was done illegally, how was it discovered and why wouldn't that person go immediately to the FBI and the NSA, report this very serious crime and point them to the evidence of its existence.? Trump claims to know of such evidence, but has thus far refused to divulge it.  There is one way to settle this, the Committee could subpoena the President and ask him under oath what knowledge, if any, does he have about evidence of an illegal wiretap.  Do you seriously not find it the least bit odd that the President claims to have evidence of a felony directed against him and against the democratic process, and has just decided to sit on it  But no, you will continue changing his exclamation points into question marks to justify him.	0

We have be honest as Americans and admit that blackface performance does not ""sharply departs from established moral and political orthodoxy"" because anti-racism is not yet (not even by a far cry) the established moral and political orthodoxy of this country.

"You have no idea the cost that goes into providing cable infrastructure. I am a ""free market guy"" and I can tell you that Comcast doesn't need legislation to create barriers to entry. Unless it is a very densely populated area, it is nearly impossible for two cable providers to exist. Buried fiber optic cable costs a boatload of money, and that cable has to be pulled to every neighborhood where you want to deliver service. It is not feasible to build the infrastructure if your customer/square foot is not high enough. That is why you generally can't cable in remote areas. It doesn't make sense to pull $10million worth of cable so you can charge 20 people $60/month. Even with densely populated areas, it takes years to get a return on the initial investment."	0

The statistical link of CTE to brain injuries in sports people is well established, but what is not yet known (but is being actively sought right now) is what the likelihood of getting CTE for a given player.  This study is pretty open that the 90% figure cannot be extended to the wider population of players.  These were brains from bodies that were donated, and the families were more likely to donate if signs of neurological decline was present before death.  These numbers are skewed, and the investigators admit that.  The numbers are alarming because it continues to show that CTE is a real problem, but only further investigation will determine its true prevalence.

Yet, there they remain and here we sit.  Thus far, if it's generally believed that Kim Jong-un hasn't yet beaten the United States, then neither under any objective standard can he be said to have decisively lost to the United States either.

DennisCasaccio That suggests that any and all systems will fail. Unless costs are reduced. And if costs are reduced - medical staff fees reduced - will quality be reasonable?   There are at least two ways to control costs.  Regulation - what we have now in health care - government specifies costs for each procedure and salaries for support staff. We know how that works.  Competition -what we have for all other goods and services. We know how that works - reasonable costs and always available.   (US health care is not a private sector service. 58% of costs of health care come from Medicare and  Medicaid. There is not a reasonable connection between the poor and the US medical system. A guaranteed Annual Income FOR THE POOR could fix that.)	0

"""It feels sad that [Quebec is] pioneering now by stigmatizing a religious minority and trying to restrict their sense of being welcomed into public space, the public sphere, and getting public services,"" said Robert Leckie, dean of Law at McGill University.  How can anyone wearing a burka complain that they're being stigmatized and restricted in the public sphere? Wearing a burka means, definitively and intentionally, cutting yourself off from society, rendering yourself invisible, making yourself an unidentifiable person, restricting and stigmatizing yourself. It is surely entirely your own fault, if it is your intention never to be seen in public, that you cannot fit-in, and are not welcomed within, the public sphere in Quebec...or any Western society, for that matter."	0

"Hi Muck! The Founders Created the Congressional Chaplain and understood the importance of opening invocation before legislative sessions--which we've done since they created the Constitution.

Hitting a deer at speed would have wrecked the car anyway, and the deer might have gone through the windshield and decapitated either the driver or passenger.  Ferraris have great brakes, and I would have stood on them.  3 AM? High speed likely was a contributing factor, along with possible intoxication.  Meth and booze? H and coke? Driving at night on Crow road, you have to expect a lot of deer crossing.  45 would be a reasonable speed, and you still might get a rutting buck jumping out of brush and freezing in your headlights.

Downtown's many independent vendors require convenient loading zones to maintain their businesses , why should a privately owned bike-share company have access , while delivery companies need to scramble to do their fulfillment. The concept of reducing vehicular traffic is all well and good , but taking away road lane space and emphasizing bicycle usage is , by my observations , not well received , the most prevalent Chinatown shoppers are older people who haul the goods in their own shopping carts , they will not ride bicycles , instead of huge bike lanes , more dedicated BUS lanes would move more people , improving their time efficiency , which might increase ridership , reducing traffic.

Notwithstanding the pettiness of his comments about the late Rob Ford and Rebel Media, the good professor has hit the nail on the head.  I, too, support a women's right to wear what she wants while at the same time deploring the symbolism of the niqab and the burka.  It is not a contradictory position.  It is one rooted in respect for individual freedoms.  Every citizen should be able to choose their clothing without the government telling them what they can and cannot wear.  And I (and everyone else) should enjoy the freedom of expression that allows me to condemn the niqab and all that it stands for without being called Islamophobic.	0

"If the deposit had kept up with inflation, it would be 25 cents. That the government has to levy a potential fine for people to return their bottles is an example of why some government interventions are justified. Throwing something ""away"" (it never really goes away), represents an externality. The true cost of something is not in the original price. Unless there is a disposal cost, the consumer is making a purchase decision based on an artificially low price. That's an inefficient marketplace.  When we do anything that externalizes the cost of something, we're bypassing pure capitalism. Pollution dumped into our air and water has costs. If you're not paying those costs upfront, someone else is. Pollution kills. Certainly we cannot stop all pollution. But we can regulate it. We can make business pay, which passes the cost to consumers. Is one a capitalist if one does not pay the true cost. Maybe it is a kind of theft.  We steal the savings from those who pay the cost in health issues."	0

For an act to be a mortal sin, it has to be grave matter, with full knowledge and full consent of the will. If full knowledge or consent is lacking, it’s still a venial sin.

Or that most people who commit the sin of adultery suffer some kind of clinical nymphomania that make it impossible for them to give full consent?  And if they are having sex without giving full consent of their will, isn’t that rape?  Do we really want to go there?	0
"Excellent article.  I suggest Lane County stop paying dues to the Association of O&C Counties, a de facto lobbying group for the logging industry working to increase logging on our federal public forests and apply this money to keep our recycling/wastes disposal sites open.  We should also increase the timber harvest taxes to comparable amounts that Washington and California states charge. Whatever amount is needed after that, increase waste disposal fees and lower the days they are open to make it work.  It would be great to have a majority of Lane County Commissioners who were working for Lane County citizens, not the clear cut logging industry for a change.  Bozevich says he works to ""protect public health""- well, a ban on aerial herbicide poison spraying would be helpful, but it seems he and others would like to allow this practice to continue to maximize profits for logging at the expense of water quality, health of people, pets, farm animals, crops and wildlife."	0

Best way to fix our housing construction quality issues would be to reintroduce a full apprenticeship program for all trades starting at 16 in highschool. This should be rigorous with in class and on the job training and require employers to hite apprentices by law or lose their licence.   Doing this would ensure a supply of quality, trained workers who benefit from follilowing best practice and are up to date on the newest innovations. It would also divert a lot of students from university who have no wish to be there.  One can still have inspections,etc, but having the skilled workers is a better foundation especially in a formal training manner, no more fly-by night construction companies.	0

Agreed, ip. It's not reasonable to expect a same-day appointment with your family doctor regardless of the reason. A system like that is neither affordable nor efficient. It means that doctors have idle office time on a regular basis.  As it is, roughly half of Canada's patients get same-day appointments with their family doctor, even if it's just for a rash. And if the problem is seriously threatening to your health, just say so. You'll either see your doctor immediately or be directed to a hospital.	0
According to other news sources, this woman is alleging that she showed up at the airport 90 minutes before her flight and there were no agents available to help her on time to allow her to make her flight.   As a result she missed the flight and had to be rescheduled, with the attendant seating problems.  The crux of the matter is the question about whether she truly showed up 90 minutes early and whether her allegations of agents not being available are true.  If the allegations are true, Air Canada would likely be at fault for not properly accommodating her family on the next flight, because it was their fault that she had to be on that flight.  I suspect that something isn't true about her allegations.  Personally, I find it hard to believe that there were no agents available.  I've traveled a lot around this country on Air Canada over the last 10 years and I've never had a problem findings available agents in the two hours before a flight.	0

Ian, I think you're placing an unnecessarily restrictive condition of compliance on the state. To me, saying a personal visit to obtain paper copies of digital data is reasonable, while digitally transferring digital data is unreasonable is very much akin to paying one's parking ticket with loose pennies--call it inconvenient compliance if you will. That's just sour grapes. As far as providing the entire public record being unreasonable, where would you draw the line? If each record is public, then all of them are public. Period.	0
That's strange. When Syrian and Russian forces were attacking the terrorist groups in Aleppo last year, the US and its allies screamed blue murder over the loss of civilian life. Now here we are with the USA and its Kurdish allies causing hundreds of civilian casualties as they assault Raqqa. And that doesn't even mention the thousands they caused in the battle for Mosul.  For western nations, human rights are largely a tool they use for propaganda purposes. When a rival great power causes civilian losses, the West goes into human rights hyper-drive. But when it's the West killing civilians- assuming they even let you hear about it- it's just a regrettable but necessary part of war.	0
First, the fiasco of taxing the employee discounts.  Somehow, the Liberal government was asleep at the wheel.  Next, the cutback of benefits of injured JTF2 soldiers.

Predictably, the usual gang of anti-American ostriches have buried their heads in the sand so that they won't be forced to acknowledge the real driving force behind this massacre. Instead of placing the blame on the odious ideology whose adherents have committed almost every act of terrorism in the world since the 1970s, the apologists and appeasers are blaming the NRA for the shooting. There is nothing in any of the NRA's literature that condones the killing of those who don't agree with its policies.

"I don't do theology; too interpretive and subjective.    I just read your Book and quote what I read.

Having kids eaten by a pair bears for kidding a 'prophet' for being bald has always sounded like overkill to me also, but He's your ""God"", not mine.

"Anyone remember opening scene from that movie from 1968""The Party"" with Peter Sellers.  It takes place sometime in India with, as far as I remember, Indian soldiers ambushing a British column in a filming sequence on a film set.  The bungling Sellers is the Indian bugler who signals the attack and who is, probably, scheduled to be shot during the battle. He bravely sounds the attack, is wounded but manages to keep on bugling, is shot again but somehow manages to stagger up and bugle some more, and then repeatedly gets up after being shot repeatedly, again and again, incredulously, eventually ruining the filmed scene to such an extent that even his own men shoot him.  Its ridiculous, its unbelievable that he manages to get up again and again, that he seemingly evades death despite being mortally wounded , again and again.     Well that is where the ANC is today."	0

"Your suggestion ""We wonder if a compromise would be to move ahead with the purchase but not allow and promote public access along the entire beach."" has already been put forth many times--but the reality is that it is impossible to restrict access to part of the beach.

The adopted Shoreline Master Program states: ""Section 3.2.D, Public Access: 5. Provide overland public access only to those public tidelands which abut publicly owned uplands, or where the public tidelands are separated from the private uplands by some natural barrier... 7. Design public access to provide for public safety and require buffers between public access areas and adjacent private property to minimize potential negative impacts to private property and individual privacy.""

Won't be able to drill in ANWR if Obama designates it a monument- which I expect, actually. I also expect Bristol Bay to be named a monument, and BB is actually significantly bigger in area than ANWR is. The courts will uphold them, as they did all of Carters, and all other monuments challenged in court. This hinges on a 1920 Supreme Court ruling- Cameron v Us which held large monuments are legal.  Carter created 2 monuments over 10M acres in size, and the courts ruled they were valid. ANWR, and Bristol Bay, likewise will be upheld. congres can gripe and moan, and rant, and thats it. any attempt to undo the monuments will be vetoed, or filibustered.	0

This article usefully adds to the debate by addressing the management of and transparency surrounding big energy decisions that, with the benefit of hindsight, may or may not pan out. But it repeats the current, incorrect populist mistake of blaming relatively recent green energy initiatives for current cost pressures. Green energy decisions, apart from demonstrably improving air quality (and where is that benefit reflected in the decision calculus?) are a marginal factor here. Rather, decisions made decades ago to use nuclear power are the primary cost drivers - nuclear power plants have consistently cost more to build than expected, have lasted no where near as long as expected and have cost more to refurbish than expected. Nuclear energy has, with the benefit of hindsight, not worked out well pretty much every where it has been tried - the UK and Germany are currently struggling with these issues and the US Westinghouse division of Toshiba corporation is filing for bankruptcy.	0

Disagree on a few points.  Trumps rise was more about a failure in government (Republican and Democrat); thus, an outsider won.  Democrats didn't have anyone like that (Sanders could've sort of been one) and the outsider was going to win.  The Republicans had him which helped them in the House and Senate.  A major economic disaster is generally what swings for certain parties to have the majority; the 2008 financial crisis caused it for Republicans and the Affordable Care Act rate increases did it in 2016.  Also disagree on the Romney stance as well.  Trump did much better with non-whites which helped him win traditional blue states.  Romney did much better among white voters which is what helped Trump in traditional Republican states.	0

You know squat, I worked for 6 summers at a British car repair shop sourcing parts and helping with various tasks. There is very little I haven't seen or been part of. I also know that no car model period hasn't gone thru their fair share of issues right off the showroom floor as there are horror stories from every single maker. In the 60's and 70;'s you could see virtually any car overheating on hot summer days. Bad pressure systems, faulty rad caps, cheap hose clamps , you name it. British cars  from that era got a bad rap because most people didn't know how to maintain them and neither did many so called corner garages. The overall quality of Ford, Chev , Toyota, Chrysler and yes English cars were far from today's standards. My parents had Vauxhauls and Austins that were every bit as reliable as a Ford or Chev of the era. Many garages had no clue how to repair a pair of SU carbs and they would butcher them in the process. Some didn't understand positive ground either	0

Let's get this straight: Harper's singular focus on diversifying Canadian trade produced multiple free trade agreements, most notably with Europe (which the Liberals almost let a local faction in Belgium mess up), and the Liberal record so far is the possible revocation of the agreement with by far our largest trading partner, the US. And now they are in exploratory talks with China, which even without free trade has a massive trade advantage, floods our country with cheaply-made manufactured goods (made with energy from coal), and is not a democracy and lacks the institutions and court system that make fair trade even a possibility.

Charters were originally supposed to try new educational methods to overcome the problems of traditional educational structure. Accountability is a an attempt to measure how that traditional structure fails so if you attempt to use the same metrics for that assumed  structure there is a high likelihood that there will be a poor fit so the results may appear poor even if the educational outcomes are very positive. The way to make the measured outcomes better is to use a similar educational structure which will defeat the purpose of charters that attempt to improve educational methodology.	0

Thanks for your service!  Are you uncomfortable with your conviction rate?  Did not one of the people you arrested have a valid justification?  Did you not make a single mistake, or did you just lie to cover up your mistakes?  Sorry if that implies dishonesty, but everybody lies, even the police (or especially the police, depending on who you ask).  If you were falsely accused, given your 99% conviction rate, do you feel you could get a fair hearing?  What if everyone thought you were scum because you were accused of a heinous crime like raping your prisoners?  Would you feel good about getting a fair hearing then?  How many of the people you arrested were, in your judgment, in need of psychiatric care?  The system is broken, no doubt.  I'm just curious how and why you don't seem to be aware of that fact.	0

All the vote buying schemes, i.e. The Louisiana purchase with mary Landrieu, all of it makes me sick. BTW, just paying the tax is no longer a cheap option, one of my loved ones is being destroyed financially by this POS legislation. Thank you obama. :(	0

"If you forced people into two camps with a question like ""Would you say your political views are mostly on the conservative side or the liberal side?"", I think you would get a response that was fairly close to the 60-40 you suggest, yes. But we used a fairly standard question with three options, as do most pollsters, while some go to five with a very/somewhat break out for conservative and liberal. But we're talking about apples and oranges here... the wording used isn't the same thing as the data being skewed.  For the history of the data we've measured on this question, you might go visit the Alaska Survey Research Facebook page. There are graphs there of the ideology question data going back 7 years.  https://facebook.com/alaskasurvey/"	0

And it is apparent you have no idea what you are talking about.  The three largest finds in the last several years were not by BP, Exxon, or Conoco.  They were discovered by Caelus and Repsol/Armstrong.  And those company's drilled those wells based on the assumption they would get the tax credits in cash so they could then use the money to develop the fields and produce the oil they found.  Same as Blue Crest in this article.  The credit system did what it was designed to do, and now by pulling the rug on the explorer's, it will slow and even stop the production, which is where this state eventually gets its revenue.  So now instead of 17,000 barrels which the state would get from Blue Crest when they were done, they get revenue on 1,000.  In stead of developing the next Prudoe Bay by Caelus, it will get shelved.  So yes, the legislature is killing the goose that lays the golden egg.	0

Lol yep. He called all Mexicans murderers and rapists. Gotcha. You ever keep anything in context?

Illegal meaning they're  against the rule of law and the law should not be ignored, hence the mass deportations. Stay within the lines when you colour bud.	1

We just came back from Florida, talked to numerous real estate agents and they are worried sick that they are getting over inflated at 3 times earnings.

"Our criminal justice system is rife with institutional racism. Maybe professors that are ignorant of our history contribute to this sad state of affairs. We have never had equal protection under the law for all our citizens. The quality of justice you receive depends on your race, gender, age, education, and wealth or lack there of. The law professors that taught all the folks in our justice system have failed to deliver the promise of ""equal protection under the law"". One of the many reasons for this is ignorance about how the role of white racism, in all it's forms, impact the criminal justice system and our society at large. I don't want to fire this prof, however her ignorance should be noted in her personnel file. I'm glad Dr. Schill is taking this seriously.

"How can this man be sanctimonious about anything?  De Blasio is a self-admitted socialist with marxist roots. He supported the communist Sandinistas in Nicaragua, even going so far as to visit the country to help the communists. THIS is what happened in De Blasio's beloved Nicaragua (see http://communiststats.com/ for reference): In one brief decade—the decade in which De Blasio supported the Sandinistas and lent them aid--Sandinistas killed 3,000 political prisoners... jailed 11,000. Prisoners were skinned alive; drawn & quartered; forced to watch wives and daughters sexually assaulted; caged in cubicles less than a square meter; ""punished"" via electric shock; deprived of food and water....Sandinista’s had their own trail of tears….imprisoning and forcibly relocating 35,000 native Americans. Sandinistas killed 110 strikers for wanting back pay.  And NONE of these atrocities were military-related.  This was just another communist regime without a soul."	0
Today's terrorism preference does set the example that the hysteria over dirty bombs and in some cases outright invasion was little more than fear inducing subterfuge to justify over-wrought and narrow minded 'anti-terrorist' policies and expenditures  Terrorism wins by inducing fear and it's most successful when the fear isn't even credible, let alone likely  If this was happening right after Bush's Homeland Security buildout, I'd expect renting a car would become kinda like flying on a plane, I'm guessing their solution would be to force car rental customers to drive shoeless  We can't allow ourselves to become overly reactionary to acts of terrorism   We can't allow policy makers to take advantage of the fear to justify ill-advised or unconstitutional responses  Much of the factors in the militarization of our police forces are examples of over-reaction.  Private contractors profiteering off of military policy is emblematic of questionable responses.  Terror wins if we give in to it	0

What is the take of Alaska's other natural resources. Alaska was set up as an owner state where resources are used to bennifit the state. So I have to ask what is the take on Fish, Timber, Mines. I believe they privatized the ownership of fish when Alaska approved individual quotas that private individuals now own. They can lease them out, give them to thier kids and I do not believe they are taxed even as property so fish and crab That swim in Alaska waters are more secure private property then our homes and it's also a multi billion dollar industry based on not spending a penny in Alaska. Basically we make bad deals across the board with our reasources. I believe BP is bad for Alaska but made deals in-line with all our extractive industries. Its nice to see the independents working here and I assure you PB, Exxon and CP are working against them.	0

"OK, Part II.  To make an intelligent go/no-go decision, you need to get the current weather and the forecast. Yes, this takes a little time - but not much - and some understanding of the terminology and weather concepts. So you need a bit of training. If you know a pilot, ask him/her to sit down at the computer and explain the relevant weather products on sites like the National Weather Service's ""Alaska Weather"", http://aawu.arh.noaa.gov/  There are many other resources on the web.  Once you have the weather for your trip, YOU can decide whether it meets YOUR personal minimums.  Are you OK in the mountains with 5 miles visibility and 1000' clearance of the highest terrain, or is that too little margin? On an IFR flight, are you OK with forecast conditions of 1/2 mile and 300' at the time of arrival? Decide.  Each flight, ask the pilot, VFR or IFR? In the clouds during a VFR flight? Tell the pilot to exit. Now.  More to learn, but this is start. Your life: you are the final authority."	0

Yes, that does make sense. I think small business is the backbone of our economy and critical to our future. But I get the impression that the Liberals have  not studied this enough. Sprinkling seems unfair, but so does making someone like you take that kind of hit if you sell your business --  a life-time of work -- to your kids. The reality is that everyone thinks they are being squeezed. A study I read a few years ago (cannot find it on-line) found that at all income levels -- from $1-million a year to $25,000 a year -- people felt if they just made a bit more, they would be happy. I think it is the same with taxation. People think, if you just took a little more from the other guy, the system would be more fair.	0

The census is very intrusive not because it helps government, but because business forced government to collect data that they could not get people to give them willingly.

I agree: the suggestion I made for Burke is not analogous to Cardinal Rosa's position in El Salvador. I made the suggestion with tongue at least somewhat in cheek, although I do think that Burke (and Muller) could do worse than accept a position in pastoral ministry under the authority of another bishop. I don't think for one second that either should be forced to accept a position like that, or that a bishop should be forced to accept them. But all parties being agreed, it could be a wonderful opportunity for them to do what they were ordained to do: celebrate the sacraments with and for the people of God. I agree, too, that Francis is handling Burke appropriately. Francis is right not to assign Burke to positions for which Francis judges Burke not suited; but I agree that he is right not to silence him (as the CDF is wont to do with supposedly errant theologians.)  As I said elsewhere: I don't think Francis should take Burke's red hat; but I do think he should take his cappa magna.	0

We all know that many peaceful protest marches are infiltrated by extremist groups such as the anarchists who commit violent acts.

The GOP policy and practice is extremely simple:  If you can't convince people to vote for your candidates, develop procedures to keep them from voting at all.  It's a nasty, cynical tactic, but it's been all too successful.    As the RG editorial notes, ""vote by mail"" eliminates all possibility of polling place voter fraud and would, more importantly, eliminate GOP voter suppression Gary Crum"	0

Auditors can be fooled, but as taught in Auditing 101, 'auditors must be attuned to fraud and error'. They must report material irregularities, and if clients' response or proposed remedies are unsatisfactory, to the regularity body. Unfortunately, they often look the other way so not to issue a qualified report. KPMG allegedly skirted/broke the code of conduct. It's not the first or last time it happened in the profession, so face facts if you're an auditor. The bigger picture is the low ethical standards in SA - professions incl journalism, all levels of government, political parties, almost all politicians, business, society and the breakdown of the family. If one is in a position of authority - head of cabinet, business, government department, audit or the household - and one is aware of a breach of the law, ethics or policy, invariably one will pretend it never happened, squash an investigation if there is one and collude to suppress the truth coming out.	0

That problem will sort itself out and it's already starting to happen.  Lots of the subpar restaurants have been closing lately because they can't afford to stay open with all the competition.

"Fundamental to the conflicted theologies of dominion and liberation is ignorance of biology, specifically, evolution, that includes evolution of soul/ consciousness and the radical femaleness of original life. ""Survival of the fittest"" has been a mode of male quest/ dominion in weeding out the 'weak' and insuring success of the strong. Biologically, male-exclusive hierarchy, is more physical than intellectual. Survival under global circumstances now requires intelligence more than physical dominance; which speaks to deep-nature femaleness."	0

In landmark 1980 legislation, an agreement was struck to open Prudhoe Bay for oil and gas exploitation and to expand the Arctic Refuge to 19.6 million acres and to create a vast wilderness area.               In the coastal plain of the refuge, Congress mandated a study to determine whether the area should be wilderness or opened for oil and gas development.              While there is oil in the coastal plain, experts agree that oil and gas development in this area would permanently and irreversibly disrupt the ecological integrity of the refuge.     The threat to the Arctic Refuge is more real than it has ever been. We have to act now, and we have to act together, if we are to protect it. The Arctic Refuge belongs to all Americans, and this shared resource must not be irreversibly tarnished so that a select few can earn a quick profit.	0

Wind farms are the future.  Just completed a trip across country using interstate 80 and 94.  Amazing to see wind turbines throughout the drive, especially in Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, and even Vermont. There is a huge amount of land in Wyoming alone that would power much of our energy needs. Together with solar in the southwest, there's no doubt in my mind that we could produce sufficient energy for the entire country by adding natural gas to the wind power, and solar.  Coal...forget it.  Oil...its days are numbered.  By 2028, we'll have a new clean energy economy to join Germany and other European nations.	0

"“You can’t review 650,000 emails in eight days,” Trump said Sunday … “You can’t do it folks.

Then use a regular expression search to exclude all the ""Carlos Danger"" e-mails, and you are left with whatever is new, which was apparently close to zero."	0

These things do not come down to us without a cloud of witness surrounding them.

Thank you, Alex.  We are waaaaay past cutting any fat from the education system.  We are into the muscle and we are negatively affecting the education, the FUTURE, of Alaskan children.  Our classrooms are too large.  It takes people to educate children and people don't work for free.  Costs rise, funding gets cut.  The double whammy result is not just that we are not providing the best we can for the children of Alaska, and we are hurting the economy by cutting good jobs - our neighbors who spend money in our businesses.  Alaskan children DESERVE the very best education we can provide - they EACH deserve the kind of education that we all want for our own children.  We need to get our priorities straight and we need to communicate that to our legislators.	0
Why don't you write something about that issue that reflects what you believe.  If you think the statement is wrong, then write about religious tolerance as you see it.  Or write about where you see religious intolerance.  I think it would be interesting to think about religious intolerance in this country - how do we show tolerance or intolerance to fellow Christians and to people of other faiths.  Or think about how we manifest intolerance just within Catholicism - in the divide that seems to exist between those who practice a JPII/BXVI kind of Catholicism and those who in tune with a Francis kind of Catholicism.  We have a bad habit of telling some people who claim Catholicism that they are not Catholics or inviting them to join a different faith because.  I find that intolerant.    So speak up.	0

This is a very bad idea. If you think about it the popular vote to elect the president would only have to come from a 300 mile radius of Philadelphia. The major portion of the population in the USA is within this area and therefore this is the only areas that any candidate would have to campaign in. The rest of the country be hanged. Just look at a map of the USA and you will see that this is true. Is this the correct way for everyone's vote to count? If this passes we can forget about voting in the majority of this country. It will just be another right taken away by ignorance instead of considering the true facts. THINK ABOUT IT!!!!	0
"If Ontario opted for private sector health care, its financial problems would be over. Based on US data, about 86% of citizens can pay for their own health care. That leaves only 14% to be paid by the taxpayer. That 14% can be funded from the money not spent on 86% of the population. That leaves a large sum for debt reduction.   There has been a lot written about the cost of the US health care. That is one example  and it is the US which is ""different"" On the other hand the private sector provides us with all our needs and wants except health care. And it works beautifully.  . Health care should be no different."	0

Good point.   Walker stated during his press conference this week that he has no patience for politics but, between his 'pull tree stumps with a rope in Metlakatla' and 'don't run from fires' analogies - Walker has fast become Alaska's Huey Long. (That's not a good thing.)  For instance, Marcia Davis, a member of his gov's office staff who was hired early on, was found to have violated campaign laws when she helped Walker and Mallott get elected.   http://www.adn.com/alaska-news/article/apoc-fines-campaign-groups-tied-governor/2016/02/25/  Davis, an attorney no less, still rakes in over $170,000/yr as one of his deputy chiefs of staff. Yes, he's got more than one even though he continues to plea to the public that he's cut his office down to the bone.  For a man who purports to have no patience for politics, Walker's decision to not fire Davis because of her APOC violations shows that he has gobs & gobs of patience for political shenanigans - even when caught.

Tree plantations, traditional management processes, BLM and USFS burn practices . . . these things on top of the massive ecocidal logging of the old growth have created a kind of ""undead"" forest, and it's trying to kill us."	0

So does training Ukrainian solidiers so that they can be sent into a conflict at some disputed area actually help? Why isn't a political solution a better alternative? The international community has accepted that Iraq has a self administered Kurdish area. So why can't Ukraine have a self administered area that has inhabitants of Russian descent?  Here in Canada, the Province of Quebec has many special areas of self administration that other provinces don't have.	0

While I myself am a liberal they are no different then conservatives,they care little for laws and want an authoritative government who only want ""their"" beliefs to be followed.

"Douthat - the usual dribble masquerading as thoughtful analysis.  This is obviously his attempt to disparage Civilta (all of his biases are highlighted):  First, religious liberty is under assault - Ross, please read this link:  https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/consensus-uncertainty-supreme-court Careful analysis of Missouri vs. Lutheran Church - guess what - common sense ruled and no religious liberty (cover for culture wars) emerged  Second, most historians and experts would disagree with this opinion - ""..if Charles Colson and Richard John Neuhaus were integralists, I am a lemur""  Well, Ross is now a lemur.  Analyses and interpretation has moved on Neuhaus over the last five years (even some Commonweal writers thought Neuhaus was not part of the Evangelical-Republican leanings.  In fact, Neuhaus was responsible for laying the philosophical foundations for exactly what Civilta points out.  Failures of liberal religion stoked Trump voters - no, rather fear, anger, and culture wars."	0

"What Vatican II said about reform: ""Christ summons the Church to continual reformation as she sojourns here on earth. The Church is always in need of this, in so far as she is an institution of men here on earth. Thus if, in various times and circumstances, there have been deficiencies in moral conduct or in church discipline, or even in the way that church teaching has been formulated - to be carefully distinguished from the deposit of faith itself - these can and should be set right at the opportune moment.""

"Free speech and the right to peacefully assemble and protest are part of the Constitution. Making moral judgments about the speech or the views of those assembled is not the place of government.  Protection of unpopular speech and views is the reason the 1st amendment is good.

"Maybe Jonah Goldberg doesn't see the racism put to harness for Trump's election, but everyone else, including those who voted Trump, probably do, and are glad that at last they have gained national respect for their bigotry - Look what we've done! In fact, Lee Atwater made dog-whistle racism the deliberate key of the Southern Strategy in electing Ronald Reagan. It worked, and Republicans haven't looked back in horror at what they have wrought; after all, if it gets our man in office, why worry about ethics? We all know that politics is baloney and you don't want to look too carefully at what goes into it. So now, the RNC knows that overt bigotry trumps covert bigotry, and they will never dump a winning strategy. It's a linear development that has come to its final fruition, and the crowd likes the way it plays.  So Goldberg shrugs ""Who, me?"" and blames intellectuals for perverting good, honest racial bigotry, the mainstay of our European culture. Liberal arts, one more thing to hate."	0

This resolution by our congressional delegation is wrong. I've lived here 40 years, come from a hunting and fishing family. The vast majority of testimony taken was against allowing the misguided state regulations to rule in Federal Wildlife refuges.  I was at the testimony.  Everyone in Alaska has been instructed not to feed the bears because it habituates them and endangers people. Bear baiters have a different set of rules. They can feed the bears and potentially endanger people. Which is it?  Either we can all feed the bears or no one should feed the bears.  Baiting is not hunting. It's a lazy person's slaughter. The wholesale slaughter of wolves in game unit 2c has begun. The pictures of gloating hunters showing no respect for the life they have  taken as they show off the bloody carcasses is worse than disturbing. Who eats wolf? Whether at the state or Federal level, Alaska needs wildlife management that is based in science,not on an unproven theory of Intensive Management.	0

Sorry, mocanic, you're also incorrect. A 2011 study by U.S. PIRG found that gas taxes, auto registration, tolls, and the like cover roughly half of highway construction costs. The rest is general appropriation. And since the gas tax hasn't increased since the early 1990s, the proportion of (my) taxpayer dollars filling that gap is ever increasing. Consider also that most bicyclists also own cars and pay the appropriate licensing fees, etc. And to take your straw man argument to its logical conclusion: If motorists are dismayed that their user fees go to bike paths, would they really prefer NO bike paths and all those cyclists on the road instead? So again -- bicyclists are already paying their fair share.	0

Most of the speakers that the left detest so much would not be nearly as popular or famous if the self righteous censors would just shut up and let them talk.

"We may think most Canadians support the federal government’s wide-open immigration policy... --- I don't follow Mr Ibbitson's analysis. Is 300,000 immigrants a year an example of wide-open immigration?  Some context would be nice.  For a long time, including before and during the years of the Harper government, Canada accepted approx. 275,000 immigrants (250,000 immigrants plus 25,000 refugees) per year.  There was no significant controversy. Numbers were periodically adjusted. An increase in 25,000 a year is well within the norm and is not opting for ""wide -open immigration""."	0

The Green Belt  created a catastrophic  land shortage for single family homes. That land shortage drove up the  prices of the  lots for the single family homes more than 10 times for the last 10 years.  That is the root cause. The price of a 50X110 building lot in Markham rose 12 folds from round 100,000 to 1,200,000. Many  people for purely ideological reason deny that the root of the problem is the   Green Belt. These ideologically obsessed people belong to the company of the climate change deniers. The climate change deniers deny the basic laws of physics, the people who deny the impact of the Green Belt and the zoning laws deny the basic laws of economics, the law of supply and demand.

Simply ""ignoring"" them is to give tacit approval to their actions.   As Martin Niemöller so famously put it:      First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Socialist.      Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist.      Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew.      Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.  At the same time, we, as well, need to condemn any violence from the fringe left.  the Antifa as the most obvious example.

"I know that you disapprove of people looking at doctrines and deciding for themselves whether or not to accept them. I keep saying that your model is Adolf Eichmann, because like him, you  accepted what you are told without question. For obvious reasons, Eichmann is a bad model to follow, and reasonable people reject it.  Yes, actual Catholics do pick and choose which doctrines to accept and which to reject. We understand that some doctrines are central to the faith, and others are not. ""Contraception is evil"" is relatively minor compared to ""Jesus Christ is both God and man"". Many Catholics reject the first, because the reasoning behind it has major flaws (and that reasoning was done solely by unmarried men, who automatically have an incomplete -- if not wholly wrong -- idea of the place of sex in marriage); but no Catholic would reject the second. The second is one of the pillars of the Catholic religion, the first is on the outskirts."	0

Great news for UH basketball - probably was encouraged by Ganot to look elsewhere. Would have been no more than a sub with limited playing time at UH (was a huge defensive liability).  His scholarship probably goes to that walk-on point guard (another defensive liability) from last year as a reward for his service, which still only leaves two scholarships. Maybe couple more are encouraged to leave, including Lewis and Remo who are limited role players and not needed with the return of Thomas.	0

People are not concerned if Trump actually builds a wall;  implement mercantilist trade policy; or promote political isolationism. This is just more stupid caricatures from his opponents and the brain dead, partisan and out of touch media & commentariat.   I think people are happy to grab onto a flawed character like Trump because at least his campaign platform challenged the hubris of the political establishment by having the audacity to talk about immigration policy; balancing multinational free trade agreements (written by big business and lawyers behind the scenes and full of special interest and political concessions) with the impact on average Joe (outside Beltway interest); taking on the hypocrisy / double standards / vanity of the media; not constantly preaching to Americans and apologising for America (remember him?); and ultimately measuring American engagement (lives) abroad first by what America gets out of it...	0

Having buses run on a designated lane for trains is a much better and superior option. - However, in this the 21st century a much better option than 19th century street level rail and 20th century bus rapid transit running on a designated lane exists. - What is this 21st century option? (1) modern technology to bundle all downtown Honolulu traffic lights into a single system controlled by artificial intelligence -  to manage traffic flow. A perfect example is how the New Jersey DOT addressed traffic congestion in Meadowlands. (2) Remodel all intersections in downtown Honolulu with heavy traffic volume into a new intersection design that enables vehicles to make a left turn at an intersection without stopping traffic.  Such as in Utah, Missouri, and Maryland - A good example of what option (2) can make is that of traffic on Fort Weaver Road where smooth flow of traffic by synchronized lights is interrupted by stopping traffic to allow cars to make a left turn.	0

Radwanski gushes that Freeland “combines a strong grasp on economic fundamentals with real-world knowledge accumulated since working her way to running the Financial Times’s Moscow bureau well before her 30th birthday”. Freeland has no economic background at all; she is a Slavicist with no particular expertise in economics or finance. She ran the FT’s Moscow bureau but she was more of apolitical than a financial journalist. She was really out of her depth as International Trade Minister and she looks to be out of her depth as Foreign Affairs Minister, since it seems that she, rather than her successor as International Trade Minister, will have the chief responsibility for the NAFTA negotiations.	0
"The man has had free healthcare his entire life because his family is very wealthy.

He was there when she, Cheney and Rumsfeld were conjuring up the lies that attempted to justifyBush's illegal and immoral invasion of a sovereign nation that had nothing to do with 9-11, WMDs or al Queda/bin Laden. He was onboard with an administration that launched a preemptive war of choice. No competent Commander in Chief would go to war for any reason other than that it was a last resort.

"Some facts about this.  When it was decided that the Poverty and Homelessness Board needed to address the thousands of homeless in Lane County, various people around the table including law enforcement argued for a ""frequent user"" facility that could house and help the men and women they see every day. They said often there was no place to take them, and it would help the police if this facility were considered the highest priority. In other places in America this type of facility really does work.  This is about suffering people already living in Lane County, on the streets and in the doorways. It promises to help make the community safer and save a lot of money for the emergency departments and the police. No influx, but help for those already here, and often, in police custody.  So yes, it is a valuable asset for Lane County. (Disclaimer: I was on the Poverty and Homelessness Board, but am not now on it. I certainly don't speak for them in any way).

"It may be a metaphor on the way out of use, if your reaction is common. So it goes.  But the metaphorical use of ""lynching"" for a nonviolent instance of prejudged/prejudicial, arbitrary and/or mob-inflicted punishment, especially with public hysteria, is well-established in English. Not unlike such other metaphorical uses of violent imagery as ""firing squad"", as well as our society's penchant for coarser violent imagery used as metaphor, whenever someone worries they're facing  'buttkicking', 'asskicking', 'whupping/whipping', 'kick in the head/can', etc. ad nauseam.

State pensions are in trouble mostly because all defined benefit plans are in trouble.  The benefit is thirty years and out with the pension based on the highest three years of salary.  Add in low contribution rates and wildly optimistic earnings projections and you see what happens.  The only pension plans that work are defined contribution plans based on years of service, money actually contributed, realistic rate of return, and no health care benefit from the pension.  The unions wanted pensions and this is what poor state management got them and the taxpayer.	0
Yep it's the Republican's fault. It has nothing to do with insurers dropping out due to loses, 25% premium increases, people who were lied to to by Obama when he was selling the ACA. Amazingly enough this wonderful program was never very popular.  Liberals who have vigorously blamed Repubs on Health Care have shown no evidence of admitting that the ACA had deep problems from the onset. It was statistically flawed, yet Liberals were so arrogant as to pretend the flaws didn't exist. No wonder the Liberals lost control of the Presidency, the Senate, the House and 33 State Governorships.	0

This is exactly why, when people are getting older, they make a trust to protect what they want to happen and keep their wealth from money grabbers and people of ill intent.  I am sure Mr. Wright prepared the Trust with the Princess just to prevent this kind of nefarious money/power grab.  No one can say if the Princess is indeed 100% or less of her faculties right now, but when she set up the Trust with Mr. Wright as Trustee, she obviously knew what she was doing and for her to change her mind now is highly suspect.  As Mr. Wright says- he is is not a beneficiary and has nothing to gain, but those like the less than respectable Mike Lilly (look HIM up) and Ms. Worth have everything to lose.   I pray for the health of the Princess and the legality of her Trust to keep the future of the Hawaiian people safe.	0

If you chose not to go to college or enlist in the military then you are the product of your own personal choices don't whine now because you made poor choices.   I chose to enroll in college, take student loans and spent the next 8yrs after graduation paying them off.  We all MAKE our OWN choices in life.  I encourage my kids to do what my parents told me to do.  Either you're going into the military or you're going to college you have no other options.  That's been my families motto for the past 4 or 5 generations.  My parents didn't believe in welfare not even parent supported welfare meaning we had to pay our own way.

By 2100 with 100 million people Canada would have the critical mass to scale up major public transportation projects.

Your comment represents perfectly what is wrong with our country, institutions, etc (although it is the norm from the trolls ((not that you're one)) in this forum). You assume that because I have the temerity to criticize someone you like (and that represents your favorite piety of diversity)  that I am a Trump supporter, or conservative etc, when neither are true. A teaching background is not a quality I would automatically consider desirable in a school board member, especially since teacher education program's like the U of O's are really one of the biggest reasons behind the continuing decline of our schools. It certainly could be, but it isn't a given. That said, I do think we need more conservatives on school boards and in teaching for nothing more than intellectual diversity. If you took the entire teaching force of 4J, I'll bet you could count the conservatives on one hand. This kind of echo chamber and lack of intellectual diversity corrodes and even destroys our institutions.	0

"The rescues don't cost much.  They just round up a bunch of Park trail crew workers and send them off on a hike looking for the lost pilgrims. They get paid the same either way.

It's still a good shelter for people out there for whatever reason just leave it alone."	0
At the end of the day, these five council members have voted to break promises made to Oahu citizens that property taxes would not be used to fund rail construction. This is more than likely a ploy to get the GET extension approved, but they have shown thier true colors......with that said, the five of them along with the mayor should be recalled immediately and replaced with people that will look out for the people of Oahu and the generations to come. The lies, mismanagement, and outright failure of rail construction is a disgrace. We can only hope that the Feds come in and do an investigation to see if these six people have been corrupted by unions and rail construction firms........things are just not making sense anymore!!	0

It is more than obvious that the Liberals did not have a contingency plan in place and are now madly reacting without the time to properly plan this out. Which is a scary thing as what else have they not planned for that can be an extremely important or catastrophic.  But we also have to address the 800 lb gorilla in the room that the left and especially the media want to pretend is not there. Trudeau meddled in a sovereign state's democratic election process by making derogatory comments about the individual that will soon be it's head of state. That is something in diplomatic circles that is never, ever, done.   I don't think it was Trudeau doing it by himself as I will extend credit to him that he is not that stupid. I do think that this was Butts and Telford's doing trying to shore up his popularity. This will cost us dearly and I just hope pay back is against them and not the country proper.	0

The dissemination of hate is one source that could be addressed.  Any Imam convicted of being linked to a terrorist act and the radicalization of the terrorist(s) involved should face life in prison in solitary with no chance of parole.   Imams found to be preaching radical islamist teachings should be charged under anti-terrorsm laws and be imprisoned for the maximum term allowed by law with no chance of parole.  Social media companies, internet providers and all web search engines must immediately cease any and all transmission of radical islamist propaganda.   The NSA and other security agencies around the world should be given the power to immediately hack and shut down radical islamist sites. The tracking of individuals and groups viewing these sites must be enhanced and then acted upon by law enforcement agencies.  Average, law abiding Muslims must take up this fight against the radicals - reporting them to authorities and working to reform Islam for the 21st century.	0

Fr. Pavone is incorrect about the reason abortion rates are down and if he were more honest he would also mention that pregnancy rates/birth rates are down and that abortion rates are down in states that did not impose any additional or new anti-abortion laws. The ACA's contraception mandate making contraception, especially the long acting reversible methods like IUDs available without a co-pay is the primary reason for reduced abortion rates. Fewer women and teens are getting unintentionally pregnant so naturally there are fewer abortions. Nothing at all to do with anything the pro-lifers have done.	0

As MC says, the time to be concerned will be when Trump actually backs the elimination of medicare.  Actually, single payer and even nationalization of medicine would be best for the country.

"Several years ago on another Coburg corner, there stood a young couple in the spring drizzle. He held a sign, she held an infant. They didn't look destitute, just desperate. They were wet and embarrassed, standing well back from the curb and reticent to make eye contact. Mine was the only car waiting at the light. The window went down; he approached sheepishly and said thank you without looking at the folded bill. When he showed it to her, she burst into tears. The light changed; both were shouting thank you and crying as the car rolled away.  Next time, I'll suggest he get a real job instead.  Many, many years ago, my beater of a car, loaded with everything I owned, broke down in a remote section of southeast Montana. Local kids on dirt bikes were scouting from the nearby hills. A hastily scribbled ""Help Please!"" sign saved the day when a driver stopped. This was not good, he said. No money, just help. I didn't stop again until I hit Butte.  Next time, I hope he stops again."	0

Sad fact is Nei unions are basically leeches on the backs of taxpayers. Constantly draining them of tax money to fund their lavish pensions, excessive medical and other benefits. All about taking care of #1, sticking it to other taxpayers. . Nei would do well to copy San Diego's lead where the state supreme court upheld the city moving all new hires, 300-500 per year, to a 401k plan, no more lavish pension. Unions tried hard to stop it, smart judges kicked them to the ground, shut them up. Taxpayers win big time. . CA judge also ruled,  “pension rights are not immutable,” that local governments “may make reasonable modifications and changes” and that “the employee does not have a right to any fixed or definite benefits but only to a substantial or reasonable pension.” . Nei would do well to rein in these greedy unions. Or establish a special tax applicable only to union members. Call it a pension user fee.	0

""Foreclosure affects already-vulnerable populations, including many people living below the federal poverty level and many families with children living at home. There is reason to be concerned that foreclosure may exacerbate current disparities in health. Many of our participants cited poor health as the primary cause of their foreclosure; nearly a quarter had high medical bills and owed money to medical creditors.

The fact of the matter is special counsel wasn't needed and most of Congress agreed with that assessment, however the DOJ caved to the public pressure of the left and that of a few super vocal advocates of it in Congress. Evidently Comey knew exactly what he was doing and what it would take to raise the cacophony to the level that the DOJ would take the path of least resistance. I think Rosenstein's judgment at the very least has to be called into question here given the relationship between the special counsel and Comey. I must be honest. the whole thing has a tainted odor to me  and the appointment of this particular special counsel only adds to it.

Yes, Ms., Cramer you are absolutely on message. This election cycle is the GRAND example of how broken and corrupt the system has become. The accumulation of hours of free tv exposure following Trump and Sanders coupled with the primary voters of 2 states...yes only 2 States, leaving out 48 states who have no say as to who is the best qualified to run for President. After Iowa and NH, Christi, Fiorina and probably Carson will drop out. No one is dropping out on the Dem., ticket yet as there are only 2 running. Considering that Bush, Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are vulnerable it has now gone from the unusual and odd to frightening that with such limited participation (10-12 States) andleaving out the majority of states from  input, that one of the choices for President could be someone who publicly calls other world leaders stupid. Really? ...and this is Presidential? Challenging domestic ills is one thing but inappropriate behavior on the world stage is quite another. Wake up America!	0

While some of his implementation can certainly be faulted, he at least gets that the communications industry in Canada is grossly protected and abusive of their position. When the US giants can bundle internet/phone/cable TV for $100 per month versus what would likely be double that in Canada, there is something not quite right. We also have the highest wireless communications in the world. I understand the size of our country, but it seems something is not quite right. His heart is in the right place, sometimes his mind. Unfortunately it is accompanied by a fairly large ego which gets  in the way. Two out of three is not bad.	0
Teachers do it for the kids or the important work, but they are still human beings who have to live. Do you work for free? Do teachers and other public employees not spend money in the private economy?  http://www.forbes.com/sites/maureensullivan/2015/01/29/gold-plated-public-school-pension-plans-most-teachers-never-see-the-cash/#56008c6b1fe4  every other state offers teachers a pension. It's an option in 5 and mandatory in the other 44. Alaska is an anomaly. It's great in theory, and has some benefits, but it also makes it easier to leave and means that no new teachers or other public employees are paying into the pension fund despite increasing retirements.   Teachers in Alaska and 14 other states also get penalized with Social Security. It's considered a windfall prohibition, even if they've paid into the system teaching in other states or working in other fields (before entering teaching or working in the summer to supplement their salary). So much for incentivizing work.	0

Until we leave, there will be a slow but steady stream of dead and maimed American troops coming home in coffins and on medevac flights.

Just a question of how many dead and crippled young men and women, as well as billions of dollars of tax payer money, we want to throw away before we finally admit we may may be able to kill bad guys (plus women, children, etc) but we can't build a functional state there, and once we shifted our intent from A to B we had already lost the war in Afghanistan.	0
"""for the purpose of assisting another person to enter, remain in, or travel through the United States or the state of Colorado in violation of immigration laws.""

"Exactly.  This is known as the ""free-rider problem"" in economics.  It has been well demonstrated that  free common goods (in this case, health care which feels ""free"") leads to over consumption and under production.  Too much of this and the system implodes.  To protect the common good in question, governments need to mitigate the free-rider problem by a) some sort of user fee or co-pay or tax, and/or b) regulation/rules.  I'm an advocate for a careful implementation of a version of option (a).  Regulation/rules on how health care can be used and when it cannot is very undesirable, in my view."	0

"So a state-owned corporation (PetroSA/CEF) is seeking a deal whereby South Africa will be obliged to buy gas from an entity that is 65% owned by a Russian company? While there are fundamental flaws in the assumption/argument that extending our dependence on fossil fuels (concentrated energy) is necessary/desirable for energy security, it still prevails in  national energy development and policy discourse. Enthusiasm for increasing the role of natural gas in our energy mix is largely premised the assumption that it will come mostly from 'our' domestic resources. While avoiding bankruptcy of PetroSA by attracting an equity partner may make sense to its board, there's no indication of how the deal might on balance benefit the nation, even if large quantities of relatively easily-extracted gas are actually found. Seems ""path dependency"" on concentrated energy is taken as license both for selling off national resources (with associated elite enrichment) and further lock-in to fossil fuels."	0
Or more probably, was opposed by common sense- using groups of Alaskans who realized naming a street after the man makes absolutely no sense, given he has nothing to do with Alaska, has never even been to Alaska, has way too many things named after him already, and could do with naming an Alaskan civil rights leader, instead. . .....but we can go with your 'Communist' theory, if it makes you feel better.	0

Alaska dodged the bullet when Royal Dutch Shell decided to call an end to drilling in the Chukchi Sea. The oil giant showed the world how unprepared we are to work in the Far North with multiple equipment failures and a general lack of infrastructure to support such work. While no oil company wishes to be involved in a massive spill the fact is they still happen with horrific results. Few were willing to face the fact that if there had been any serious problems with Shell's Arctic Ocean drilling there would have been no way to deal with it. The Deepwater Horizon tragedy showed that there is really no way to property deal with ocean spills even when they happen in relatively mild and much more highly populated parts of the world with access to lots of spill workers and equipment. We are lucky Shell finally decided to abandon the Arctic Ocean to those living beings that are adapted to live there. They were already facing many serious threats so one less is a reason to celebrate.	0

You'll find 'compassion' somewhere between 'Alive' and 'Deceased' in the dictionary when it comes to the legal system. If you want to argue that in this case... you must be of the mistaken impression that no one died. My comment was about fact that someone died and inescapable proximity in this case. Again, I'll bet if he hadn't been there...this wouldn't have happened. And ignoring, or deferring, or avoiding that fact is what has been a problem by ignoring 'the king is wearing no clothes' in these cases. With all of the 'compassion' and 'self-control' that politically-correct people want - the real, hard facts only come out 'after the fact, when something like this happens.' This will not set well but... he who is heralded as a saint of a child, often has some devilish characteristics. By association, David was in with the wrong crowd. He had to drive there to be there for this to happen. This...is a blinding glimpse of the obvious - maybe stated a bit harshly for you, but true.	0

"One important fact that needs to be arrived at is - ""After ten years of rail GET surcharge payments, how much has the average person on Oahu actually paid"".  The state has collected about 2 Billion dollars.  Once we know how much each of us has actually paid, we can then multiply that number by four - to arrive at what each of us needs to pay in order to get to 8 Billion- the total needed from Oahu rail GET surcharge payments to complete the project.  The city has never talked about this.  Only the Tax Foundation of Hawaii has looked at this number.  Their estimate is around $200.00 per person per year.  I do not want to pay $8,000.00 for this project."	0
We have no idea what will happen with this plan. States have a lot of responsibility and leeway in how they structure their programs with Federal grants. This will impact state politics, taxes and bureaucracies. If the grants to the states are not adequate to provide coverage for enough people in each state, then there will be political pressure to increase the grants. Some are predicting that it will lead to other State based systems like Senator Schatz's. I predict litigation up to the US Supreme Court.	0

Come on folks, give her a break. She had a rocky start yesterday, probably due to nerves knowing that every tennis fan in Canada was watching her, but did much better in the rest of the match. Her shot selection was good, but too often she misfired on execution. She also had some bad luck with balls off the tape. But she also made some great returns. I believe that her game is improving. Additionally, her opponent (Vekic) was no slouch, despite her misleading ranking. Let's all just back off a bit and give her some breathing room and support.	0

If Margaret Stock believes all four of the candidates on the stage at the Arctic debate basically agree on the policies, it seems to me she should vote for the one with the most experience in getting things done.  Lisa Murkowski has funded an icebreaker, water and sewer projects and health clinics.  She is expert at oil and gas as well as renewable energy and pushes for both in her energy bill. She is the Senate's expert on the Arctic and is a staunch defender of Native self-determination.  She knows how taxes impact families and small businesses because she's raised a family and her husband owned a small business for years, one now run by her son.     I watched the debate.  Lisa got the most applause and was eloquent in her understanding and love for the people who live above the Arctic Circle--people she has come to know well in her many visits there.  And it was clear that she deserves reelection.	0

I'm an 80% service-disabled veteran & met with my VA physician in West Linn last week. I'd prefer to receive VA medical care in Eugene, but I was seriously mistreated at my last appoint there. Dr. Flora Fazelli told me that the VA cannot afford to provide me with what I need. She said the VA budget is limited now as way too many veterans are seeking care. She said the budget did not plan for all of the recent veterans seeking care at VA facilities. I told her that if the VA Secretary can use military aircraft to take his family on a European vacation at taxpayer expense, there should be a way to allocate adequate funds for veterans in need. AND, I said, if the VA has too many veterans asking for adequate VA health care, THEN the US should stop creating more and more veterans daily who need VA services. I say get out of Afghanistan, Niger, and elsewhere. If budget is too small, charge VA secretary for the full cost of his European family vacation & add that money (+ waste to VA's budget	0

Hi Charles, We would have linemen dedicated to Bainbridge Island, so unlike a utility with a large service area, our utility would service just Bainbridge - we would always be priority number one. To give you a better idea of how it would work, lets look as a few public power utilities nearby.  Public power utilities like Penn Light (Gig Harbor), Port Angles Electric, Orcas Power and Light (San Juan County) and Stieilacoom Electric all have far better reliability records than PSE. These utilities are more reliable because they have crews based locally in their service areas, have committed to reliability improvements like undergrounding, operate on a nonprofit basis so they are service not profit motivated.   Local crews will be able to respond immediately to outages. In the event of large scale outages, we will via public power's Mutual Aid Agreements have access to line crews from other public power systems.	0

Part 3 Francis lives that discernment, so I just assume that the cautious path he is leading us down is precisely the way the Spirit is calling him. A radical progressive pope imposing his own will on the Church would be just as destructive as JP2, a radical conservative pope who did impose his will on us, because he believed in V1 not V2. Both lead to schism. Francis is NOT leading us on a middle course between the two, but rather is setting the scene for acceptance of and comfort with open, substantial disagreement, and that is the arena in which the Spirit can do her thing best.  My second anecdote was in Francis initial long interview give to half a dozen Jesuit magazine around the world. There was some important inside baseball there, largely missed by commentators.   He was asked about Ignatius' Rule for Thinking with the Church (http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/seil/seil82.htm). In the context of the  reformation, they call for an intense inclination in favor of the magisterium.	0

I have to admit, my blending of fruits and virtues was a bit of a ploy to elicit a response from you as it has been duly noted that the more hits at NCR the more ad revenue is generated. Thank you for your continued patronage.  Secondly, you repeatedly succumb to the juvenile game of SPRS (Superfluously Pious Roman Semantics). That Rome has made these silly little distinctions and codified them into neat little dicta is inconsequential to the average Catholic Christian. There is no reason to improve upon Holy Scripture as it is written... a tree's fruit is a simple enough analogy, don't you think?  If you spent as much time being/doing charitable works you would find yourself much closer to the heart of Christ's gospel. Instead you make your real priorities known by your incessant blogging and phony fraternal correction. Rome has you by the short hairs and they ain't letting go until you decide for yourself to adopt a more mature spiritual/theological outlook.	0

We will see, but I tend to agree.  What Trump is covering up is his business contacts in Russia that are likely in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which his kids could go to jail for.  It is up to the Special Counsel to prove it.    Hillary sprung her own trap by not making Booker VP (yes he is neo-lib, but not more than Hillary and would not alienate any Bernie Bots who are not already lost) to edge the black vote in the four key states she lost and by not immediately attacking Trump when he brought up partial birth abortion, which is already banned under the U.S. Code (she could even promise to support it, she would not have lost any female voters), and by showing how much the pro-life cause is an electoral exercise, not a movement to really do anything for the unborn.  She would have then got the same percentage of the Catholic vote as Obama and would have won.	0

Let's get real.  Republicans blocked hearings on Garland because they could.  Democrats didn't block hearings on Gorsuch because they couldn't.  Elections have consequences.

The question is whether that finding must have a factual basis before it is declared.  The data on terrorism in the United States consistently indicates that the threat largely lies elsewhere. Judge Robart made that point in his ruling.   Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, has arrived at a striking finding: Nationals of the seven countries singled out by Trump have killed zero people in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1975 and 2015. Trump’s action “is a response to a phantom menace.” 3 Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees—all by Cuban refugees in the 1970s. Zero by Syrian refugees.  Contrary to Trump's claims Obama did not ban people from the seven listed countries. The Obama administration and Congress had previously designated them as places people couldn’t visit if they planned to participate in the U.S. visa-waiver program.	0

"Again, just using numbers presented in this article.   19% are unfounded. Up to 8% are false. This means at least 11% are insufficient evidence. The article suggest that reasonable 'unfounded' rate is half or less of this. At 9.5% unfounded it would leave only 1.5% of cases as insufficient evidence, since 8% are reported to be false.  How do you expect police to be so superhuman where only in 1.5% of cases they would not produce ""beyond reasonable doubt"" standard of evidence for a particular crime? Even precogs in Minority Report had higher failure rate than that.  What you are asking, using your own numbers, is not reasonable."	0
The bottom line is, here in Canada these people are not being shot at. They are not being bombed. They will not wake up in the middle of the night to mortar attacks, nor will they run the risk of stepping on land mines when they go outside.   Over the past year they have received $3,700 a month of our tax dollars from the federal government. They have had 12 months to get their lives in order, to get jobs, to put themselves in a position to stop requiring government handouts.   At some point, the gravy train must end and they must become responsible for themselves.  Those who disagree are free to return to Syria at any time.	0
Lisa and Sullivan (and Young) are waging war on Alaska's wildlife. Under the claim  of state's rights they are well on their way to get  rescinded a US Fish & Wildlife Service rule that puts  the brakes on the wolf and bear slaughter which the Alaska Board of Game  conversely can and does impose.  Brutalizing  Alaska wildlife chasing and shooting from helicopters as state policy is extreme abuse. There are more examples too.  This is presented by Sullivan and Murkowski to the US Senate as state's rights.  This Board of Game is way out of bounds misrepresenting Alaska to Alaskans in their abuse of wildlife and to the US Senate, dishonestly  representing what is going on here seeking Congressional reinstatement of the abuse.	0

So they creep into Canada the illegal way rather than going through the ports and this is not considered criminal?  Wonderful indeed, why bother to do it the right way.

Encounter with a Russian spy A new window into Page’s potential links to the Kremlin opened in April, when BuzzFeed reported that he’d met with and passed documents to a Russian intelligence operative in 2013.  Page confirmed to BuzzFeed that he gave information to Victor Podobnyy, an undercover Russian intelligence officer working out of Moscow’s United Nations office in New York City.    A U.S. court filing obtained by the news site contained a transcript of Podobnyy and a colleague, Igor Sporyshev, discussing the recruitment of an individual identified as “Male-1” as a source.  Page told BuzzFeed he was “Male-1,” who Podobnyy described as an “idiot” in the transcript.   Corey Lewandowski introduced Russia-linked Carter Page to the Trump 2016 team.  And Trump picked this idiot as a foreign policy advisor and campaign 'aide'.   https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html?_r=0	1

Txpyer very sad that you feel this way. Your comments suggest that we grew up during the 50's and 60's. I say that because it was a much simpler time when families and neighbors shared what little they had because they truly cared for each other. My parents struggled to provide for our family of nine. My dads working ohana included farmers, hunters and fishermen who always had Japanese taro, cucumber, kakuma, smoked meat and various kinds of fish to send home with my dad. In turn my dad, me and my five brothers would help with their home improvement projects or other events that required additional manpower. While we were native Hawaiians our extended ohana included Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Portuguese, Korean, and hapa haole. While growing up my dad always told us to be proud that we were Americans and lived in a free country. Most importantly as a veteran of WWII he insisted that we exercise our right to vote and always pay our fair share of taxes. Helping the needy was a duty.	0

Do you ever get tired of typing out “homosexual”?  How would anyone know that in their last days or hours they remained “unrepentant” as you say. Perhaps “they” have nothing to repent for. Perhaps the lesson for all of us in the end is compassion and mercy.  I have little expectation of the church and it’s apologists. I do know that the Pope has said that there is “value in irregular relationships”.  I know that Christ directed us to “Judge not, lest ye be judged...” I also know that He commanded us to love others as ourselves. So easy to stand on orthodoxy, it doesn’t take much thought. Just follow the check list right?  Harder still to admit that orthodoxy may be wrong and it’s even harder to extend love to those that are so different from ourselves. You might reply that I am heterodox but I will stand on love and be judged without fear.	0

It's obvious that Facebook is a free and accessible stage for everyone. And it’s really good news that Ms. Sandberg promises to keep the policy of the free speech. But on the other hand, the risk for this stage to be used for dangerous purposes is high, as a usual user can have thousands of followers and the flow of false information and propaganda through Facebook becomes tremendous and unstoppable. This fact is especially unfavorable for children, as violence; human mistreatment and all kind of unfavorable things are available on Facebook. What’s more, nowadays Facebook is one of the most used places for, so called, “informational war” between countries, or other opposite objects. That’s why, along with keeping the Facebook available and even encouraging the freedom of speech there should be special policies in order to help societies to be safe from propaganda and false news, and to control the flow of the information as much as possible.	0

The population article should start from historical numbers. Asia had 75 percent of the world population, and Europe had 10 percent, till the early 19th century. Today European populations (including the Americas) are 30 percent of the world population. Asia has fallen to 57 percent.

It is really DUMB to think the canadian government would not follow the law.  Of course the person who claims has to prove they are legitimate refugee..

One can make claim all they want and when checked if they are not refugee but a want to immigrate than apply that way.. NO government assistance if you apply as Immigrant better have sponsor or lot of money..  not getting in on Refugee status is not one and that is how it is and how it will be.

"My requirements haven't changed.  American white supremacist institutions are, and have been since their inceptions, inimical to people of color to a degree not experienced by the majority of white Americans, because those who control said institutions rely on them for military and political support.

As a result of changes in state laws enacted since 1789, the people have the right to vote for presidential electors in 100% of the states, there are no property requirements for voting in any state, and the state-by-state winner-take-all method is used by 48 of the 50 states.

I know the price of peace is priceless, and the reality that evil cannot be justified and allow to flourish in any circumstance.  The crimes of the government of NK is well documented and factual evidence based.  The dear leader brushed away the invitation by the American President.  NK does this as it thinks it is protected by China as it was in the Korean War, which concluded unresolved by armistice.  Time to conclude it.  Threatening nuclear destruction, and nearing the means to do it, is a serious international crime.  Think of where there missiles could land on the west coast of Canada.  It is NK technology after all.  It is time to put out an internal arrest warrant as well as a bounty.

Well, as a veteran I am grateful for being able to use the VA system. Great people.  But, the best medical program I have experienced was the original Oregon Health Plan set up by Governor Kitzhaber. For low income Oregonians it allowed me to quickly see a doctor just two blocks away, with no deductible, and it also included basic dental and vision. It was simple and I suspect was fairly inexpensive. It's implementation was efficient and flexible.  If given the choice between that Oregon Health Plan and the VA system, or medicare, I would choose that Oregon Health Plan. Most vets don't get dental care. While there is a limited dental plan for veterans, it is quite limited. Even if national health care is expensive, it is probably the most important thing our govenment can do, get decent medical care to all Americans. I do worry about the future of the Affordable Care Act, and by the way, it is not permitted for veterans to enroll in both the VA and that system. Hugh Massengill, Eugene	0

I'm sure investigations will be done, 6-7 should be about right to come up with very little.  wink  I don't think swaying the election is remotely the central issue.    Heck, we had so much misinformation from the candidates and homegrown media, that it's hard to worry about Russian misinformation.     Like most of these things, the only thing that would damage PE would be a proven coverup.    On the surface it seems possible, but only hard evidence and Trump knowledge would be damning, at least to me.   He wouldn't be the first president to have sex outside of marriage, but the only one I know of that is set up by a country that is clearly a dictatorship with aggressive ambitions.  We'll see, but I think the PE years will be full of all kinds of allegations and investigation.   He's broken every convention on public disclosure over the last 40 years.     As the rumors/evidence grows, every thing he's avoided revealing, particularly tax's and business practice will be combed through.	0

"Morality.....the concept of ""right and wrong"" is always subjective and not shared by all.  ""National shared morality""....maybe we've had areas of shared and others of unshared over the years.

Some still see the invasion of Iraq as a moral, noble effort bring the ideals of ""exceptional America"" to the Middle East...I didn't.  I think the same difference of opinions exist on virtually every issue our nation has faced, internationally and internally, over my lifetime.  We can all define an abstract ""morality"", but when it's applied to action, we find divergent opinion: Obamacare:  support it or repeal it? Public education? support it or privatize it? Welfare? Punishment/rehabilition? Increase minimum wage? Yes, no and maybe repeal it.....and on and on.  We now are so polarized on these issues and believe ""WE"" are right and have the moral high ground..and ""THEY"" are wrong and immoral.. (cont)"	0

On CTV’s Question Period today, the two young lovelies in the scrum, Stephanie Levitz and Laura Stone, both thought that Trudeau’s biggest achievement over the parliamentary session was how he managed his relationship with Trump. Hard to see why they would think so given that countervailing duties were already put on our lumber in April, with this second round to come just after the session ends. If this is what success looks like, what would they consider failure? The argument that Trudeau was dealt a poor hand but has played it well doesn’t wash. He never fired Gerald Butts for his moronic tweets linking Trump to the KKK. His new and old Foreign Affairs minister have both had thinly veiled and unnecessary attacks on Trump in their statements in the House of Commons, and Trudeau suggests he is willing to escalate a trade war with the US by threatening US thermal coal exports and the CF-18 contract. We still don't know what Trudeau would like to see in a renegotiated NAFTA.	0

With the exception of children and legitimate spouses of Canadians. It's fair to generalize that immigration benefits foreigners and corporations. Not Canadians. It's very simple and easy to understand. Taxes or the net fiscal situation is actually negatively impacted by immigration, it costs Canadians in government spending to bring in and have immigration, more than they contribute to the economy in taxes etc, for one because we are supporting more people with our generous Canadian health and other programs. It's very simple to understand, if you had a company and 7% the people on payroll not doing anything and 10% of the people only doing half as much as they can, would you bring on more people? Like a dummy. Wake up people, our high immigration is and has been a fraud and abuse on Canadians. Furthermore so called benefits can all be achieved by Other Policies. And there is more to know.

I understand the Congressional Delegation's obsession with developing ANWR, but it doesn't hold the same value to Alaska as did over 35 years ago. Hopefully they're looking at those things which will bring our State the most revenues.

The PFD contributes to this fake economy.

I think a sensible, constructive discussion of ""affirmative action"" is only possible if individuals agree on two things: a) affirmative action was (and is) the result of ""good intentions.""

I had hoped that the end of the American election also spelt an end to Sarah Kendizor's hysterical bleatings; evidently, it wasn't so.  Trump is an ignorant buffoon, to be sure, but comparisons to 3rd world dictators, accusations of kleptocracy, and painting the America media as anti-Semitic are arguably as reprehensible as the bombastic --and sub-moronic --calls for a wall at the Mexican border or barring Muslims from immigrating.  Yes, Sarah, your country has problems.  And I agree that 4 years of Trump probably won't make them any better.  But the only way to combat ignorance an intolerance is with the truth.  Your brand of editorializing will merely polarize the centre and push the wingnuts even further to the post-truth right.  Please, Globe and Mail, stop paying this hysterical lunatic for her dubious copy.	1

Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud.

He was a pretty good cavalry commander, though; ""hit 'em where they ain't "" is still a good rule.   The US wasn't reticent to bring charges against Confederate officers and there were plenty of drum-head and more formal courts martial, see, e.g., Cap't. Wirtz.   The US hauled Forrest and John Brown Gordon before Congressional committees on numerous occasions; if there was a sustainable charge to be made, they would have made the charge.   Oh, and lots of good Yankee banks and insurance companies invested in the trade Forrest was in; they just don't want to talk about it these days.  I really do hope I fired you or something."	0

Hi Eric: I wrote the clarification and updated the headline on this story. I don't think the clarification is the 'polar opposite' of what he was quoted as saying in the original story: At some point he might be open to considering a tax increase/extension. But he is also clear (and we weren't) that it's not time yet for that. That's a different position and a different headline than that he is joining the growing chorus for asking the Legislature to revisit the GET. I feel like it is better to let readers know what the guy is actually trying to say than leave a misimpression out there. -- Patti Epler	0

Don't disagree.  The wear and tear argument from cyclists is stupid anyways.  It's not about using the same roads it about it costing additional to add protected bike lanes to current roads.

Dr. Sinoto was an amazing pioneer in  research and study of the spread of the polynesian peoples out into the Pacific which probably reached all the way to South America. His archeological findings and the story of the voyaging canoes of the polynesian tell an amazing story of a people who did all that with no metal tools or charts or compass or written language.  And the full story is still not known. Will there be others who will carry on Dr. Sinoto's work.  I sure hope so.	0

"Mr. Tylor,  Sorry for my clipped response.  This commenting system is quite limiting.    To clarify, I did not ""try to claim that the reason people suffer today due to these natural disasters is because of Adam and Eve's disobedience and rejection of God"", as you assert.  Rather I said it was presumptuous for you to conclude that God ""could not control physical conditions on Earth, including flora and fauna, if he chooses to"".    There is a difference.  The ""time and unforeseen occurrence"" that befalls man is due to the ""lack"" of God's protection, not his ""causing"" it.  When the Earth is filled with humans that acknowledge and love the Creator he will extend protections necessary to protect life and the human experience.    Until that time, those phenomena that adversely affect men will continue, including those directly caused by Satan and his horde and by men.  They are not caused by God.      I am glad to hear that you still believe in a God."	0
"Yes, I know you do.  I am afraid we are not told what characteristics of God Man and Woman image.

While it might be fun to speculate, moving forward with a bulldozer over two millennia of practice, the Church's teaching, and so on based on a hunch is probably foolhardy not to mention presumptuous."	0

You're right. The things that came out of her mouth campaigning for McCain changed everything, but it didn't change her record of even-handedness (lack of partisanship) in doing her job as governor before that. The price of oil doesn't enter into it because people had just as much to grumble about then as they do now. It's just the state government's to-do list was a lot longer. As far as tools of the oil industry are concerned, let's remember what the repeal SB 21 campaign and the joint independent/democratic ticket in the governor's race was all about: getting the tool out of the governor's mansion.  I'm sure the one thing we can all agree on is that Sarah Palin's VP run was a disaster for everyone but comedians.   Have a nice weekend.	0

I don't really see any proposal for a solution in the article. Although I think the contribution of foreign investment is being underestimated, I do agree there is a supply issue.  Take for example recent data from Metro Vancouver - 80% of residential land houses only 35% of the population. That's a supply management problem. The solution is not simply to allow urban sprawl. That brings a host of other issues such as poor transportation, poor public services and high crime. A better approach to the supply issue rezoning and re-balance the above land use ratio (urban density). Detached homes will become rare and more expensive, but affordable options like townhouse will be in greater supply and more affordable. For example, duplexes in Vancouver are now >$1M! because of supply does not meet demand. Canada's largest cities will need to ween themselves off the detached house.	0

Never underestimate the power of Facebook to create a false news circle jerk on the left either. So many fell for the incessant character assassination of Clinton on Sanders Facebook organizing page that hundreds of thousands didn't vote at all or cast votes for Stein or Johnson including Ms. Moore if I'm not mistaken.

It's demand that's the problem, and surprise, surprise it is government-induced.  In the case of real estate in general, it is a side-effect of dumb global government moves.  Two in particular:  first is the idiocy of zero-interest rate policies in much of the world.  The second is lesser-known:  the implementation of the CSR (Common Reporting Standards).  The CSR is a global initiative whereby governments can share information on financial accounts of people/entities.  It applies to all financial accounts and assets.  Guess what asset class these geniuses left OFF the list?  Real Estate!  So they have made Real Estate an effective means of money laundering and hiding assets for the rich.  Should it then be any wonder why so much foreign money is flowing into these markets (globally)?  And of course once the high end gets crowded out, it trickles down.	0

The so-called restorationists should go visit the new churches in Poland.  Granted,  very few were allowed to be built by the Soviet occupiers, but those few that were represent very contemporary architecture (this while JPII was Primate of Poland as archishop of Krakow).  It is even instructive to visit the chapel at the Catholic University of Lublin (where JPII taught philosophy).  It is breath taking in its sense of the sacred, but very very simple and very, very contemporary. To see just one of the very fine post- Vatican II churches, one might visit the Church of the Visitation in Kansas City..

Maybe AB Dolan is  (reluctantly, I admit) reacting to Pope Francis' suggestion and example of finding lodging in a more low-rent neighborhood. If so, I hope he also adheres to Francis' admonition and example of associating with the serfs in the pews and on the streets. Not an easy thing to do in an archdiocese the size of NY, but P. Francis manages it nicely and is one reason he is so beloved.  To be fair to AB Dolan, he has a huuuuuge job, as Mr. Trump would say.	0

"Trump will never criticize Putin's Russia. You know what they say, ""follow the money."" Here's what a top NY Times commenter had to say about Trump, his money, and his connection to Russia a few days ago:  ""A trail of evidence will prove that Trump was receiving dirty laundered Russian funds from Bank of America and/or Bank of Cyprus. None of the US banks would loan to him; he was too much of a credit risk. So the Russians controlled by Putin effectively ended up supplying him badly needed cash. And then, as a result, the Russians and Putin owned him and still own him. THAT'S why he inexplicably has been so unbelievably complimentary to Putin. And that's why an incredibly high number of his cabinet have not just ties but very deep ties to Russia, including Wilbur Ross, who had and/or has a huge ownership position in, you guessed it, Bank of Cyprus, where a lot of the dirty money to Trump may have come from.""  Release the tax forms! Only they will prove or disprove this plausible claim."	0

"True, Warren Buffet doesn't buy ETFs, but that's because he's an exceptional investor.  If we were all like him, nobody would need ETFs.  However, when he's gone, that's essentially what he suggests for his wife (from the 2013 Berkshire Hathaway letter (http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf, pg. 20): ""My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certain instructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife’s benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.)""

"In the Gospels we hear that ""and He did all things well.""  And that's our model.

We need to use our intellect well, we must develop what are called the human virtues:  prudence, justice, temperance, & fortitude, etc. very well.  These ""developable"" capacities will aid us in making good decisions, moral decisions, efficient decisions, holy decisions in our work life.   We must give our whole self to the tasks of work.  He told us we were put here to work.  This was even before the ""fall"".   So we must give, as He commanded us (not a suggestion), our whole ""heart, soul, mind and strength"", not just abstractly in our faith & in our ""religious life"", but in our work life, & in our family life, and in our leisure.

"I think Sean McGuire got one part of the story wrong.  The ""Park"" wolves taken out of the Stampede corridor weren't harvested for their pelts.  The pelts really aren't worth enough to bother with.  The wolves were harvested by hunting guides, sometimes with clients in tow, to give the moose and caribou calves a break.  (Helicopters? They didn't need no stinkin' helicopters!- like ADF&G does).  Then the moose are harvested by meat and trophy hunters, some of whom hire those same guides.  The money is in the guided hunts... first for the predators and then for the prey... not in the pelts.  I wonder if wildlife photographers would pay as much to view wildlife as hunters do to harvest the same animals?  Might change the whole dynamic..."	0

Canadians count on the opposition and Liberal MPs with an understanding of the risks of marijuana harms to defeat the Prime Minister on the issue of legalization. This was not a top election issue and this government does not have a mandate to expose the Canadian taxpayer to massive class action law suits for this government's involvement in providing greater access to a drug that is acknowledged by this country's top health agency - Health Canada. The case law is that of the case of thalidomide. The government knew the risks and allowed it on the market anyway and who paid was the taxpayer for the damage. In 2015 we paid out $180 million to 100 victims.  The government of Canada knows the risks established by evidence based science and  they can not legalize marijuana without exposing the taxpayer to liability and damages. 1 million grade 12 students are currently using and the government knows and acknowledges the risk to reproductive health - testicular cancer, dna ,sterility. $$$$	0

Sen.

Of course, this response ignores our responsibility for deciding how to handle the offense.	0
I understand what you are saying. And I'm curious how they got these folks to come in in the first place. However, I believe the chronic, dysfunctional homeless population this is designed for is also the costliest in terms of public services and public safety. For that reason I think it's worth a try.   I would like to see some tough love in getting them into treatment for mental illness and stabilizing them to see how much they can progress, and of course getting them indoors under supervision is the only practical way to do that. I am concerned this program may go too far in allowing a self-determination approach, but there has to be something between locking them up in an institution and throwing away the key, and letting them roam the streets in squalor. Maybe they will find that folks can learn to prefer indoors and be more willing to undergo substance abuse and mental health treatment and stick with the new lifestyle. I hope the DP follows this closely.	0

Here's a writing tip for the author and, frankly, everyone. A red flag for extreme personal bias is when the first eight paragraphs keep being about the writer and their feelings of social oppression. For a good point of reference, dredge up almost any piece penned by career kook Lyndon LaRouche. You'll see the same pattern, excessive use of first person pronouns, declarations that the mainstream world is out to get or silence them.   To be sure the whole piece is a string of fallacies and hyperbole, but by paragraph six that could already be predicted. If you are not specifically the subject of the article then avoid focusing all the attention on yourself.	0

Only a few countries such as Russia and the US really ever cracked the technology for making “unitary” Sarin that had any kind of useful shelf-life. The main chemical reaction that produces Sarin creates 1 molecule of hydrogen fluoride, a potent and dangerous acid, for every molecule of Sarin. This residual HF destroys nearly anything the Sarin is stored in, and quickly degrades the agent.  The US and the former USSR made a huge effort to find a way out of this problem.  They found different ways to refine the HF out of the Sarin using very expensive chemical engineering techniques.   Furthermore, The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspections after Syria’s accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2013 revealed a variety of fixed and mobile mixing apparatus for making binary nerve agents.. Syria either did not develop such techniques or decided it was far cheaper, safer, and easier to stockpile binary components for a “mix it as you need it” process.	0
You can do whatever you want.   I don't care what you do.   I'm not the one painting the situation - climate science and reality do that all on their own.

I agree.  Everything I have read Tillerson having said indicates the man is a man of reason and logic, not an ideologue nor a radical social conservative.  That might mean he will not get along with the impetuous and knee-jerker Trump, but the more intelligent people in the cabinet the better.  So much better than having moronic ideologue loose cannons like Palin or Giuliani in there. However there are still likely to be some radicals like Rick Perry and Myron Ebell who don't belong in a video arcade let alone cabinet!	1

The author of the column poses obvious and excellent questions about the privileged pension plans of public employees compared with the CPP for the rest of us.  Fortunately, he can go right to the top and ask these questions of the finance minister himself, Bill 'More Dough' Morneau who used to be his boss and whose father founded the company where he works.   He might also ask Morneau how come when he was leading said company not long ago he co-wrote a book about how well, comparatively, the Canadian middle class was faring in the Harper years yet once he became a Liberal politician he changed his position 180 degrees and now bangs on about a decade of middle class destruction under Harper and the country suddenly needing deficits, a new public pension plan plus other things he so recently opposed.    As the column suggests, the CPP is hardly fair.    But if one examines the pay, perks, pensions and productivity norms of public versus market sector employees,  many things are unfair!	0

Well, closing loopholes probably is a good idea.  However, just what constitutes a loophole seems to lie in the eye of the beholder. .

Further, if you don't have a pension; you don't have any kind of job security;  and your income may vary quite unpredictably from year to year, maybe you need to look at the taxation burden over the entire career arc, not just an annual snap-shot. .

I would just note there's a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Two Inlets, MN, a very small town up north.  It is beautiful and serene -- the entire church, stations, and grounds are beautiful and serene -- and the parish has mass outdoors there on nice Sundays.  If they want to build a replica grotto in Kentucky, do it out of reverence and joy, not desire to create a tourist attraction.	0

"Harassment of those with PTSD is also a factor. The system is designed to disbelieve these claims - they are treated with suspicion instead of support. Or ""support"" by the way of harassment. Disability coordinators etc. are just trained to harass people back to work or get them off the payroll (discharged). If a person makes it through the process, it has added more problems. Once that happens, where is a person with ""mental health"" injury supposed to work? They are marked for life - people with such disabilities have extremely high unemployment and poverty.  Until the term ""mental heath"" is sent to the bin, and the issue understood as physical injury (partly through education of non-medical people that this is physical and long term via epigenetics), this type of stuff continues. Get the non-medical people out of the system so those with PTSD only deal with trained medical professionals who understand it is a physical injury that affects cognition. Mandatory re-employment law helps."	0
Yeah who would've thought a desert would be hot lol. I'm assuming Palm Springs was in the 100's too as it always is in summer. When they get snow and extreme amounts of rain is when you should be alarmed. Until then the desert is going to continue to be hot and bone dry.	0
Cardinal Burke seems determined to provoke confrontation. As you suggest, Francis may welcome it inasmuch as the reform work he is undertaking is meeting with resistance that is wider and deeper than the four cardinals pressing the 'dubia.' It may suit his purposes to have it out with the leader of the resistance.  Over the course of his life, the man who is now Pope Francis has never been hesitant to meet confrontation head-on. Surely at this point in his life, and with so much at stake, he will not be deterred or sidetracked by Ray Burke.	0

This article is nothing but a con job. I can see right through it. The main reason so many international students are here is to help pay the bulging salaries of university professors. There are only so many seats in classrooms and only so many rooms in the dorms. Anyone who has been to a large campus lately can see the crowded - and almost unhealthy - conditions that have been created as a result. There is no doubt that domestic students are been pushed out. Anyone who tells you otherwise is outright lying. International students have a place and contribute to Canadian university life, but a right balance needs to be achieved that doesn't put local students at a disadvantage and jeopardizes the quality of education. It's very sad to see this unfolding.	0

I wonder if people really understand the severity of this condition.  It is not a benign death for infants as they experience catastrophic system failure.  MSW is over the deep end with this column.  Parental rights are not absolute and it is not that rare an occurrence for courts to appoint a medical guardian in these cases.  Denial operates very strongly in parents and they don't always make the best decision or even process the severity of their child's condition.  This is a sad situation, but the courts are correct....all four of them.	0

I thought that Catholic liberals and the liberal interpreters of Vatican II wanted Catholics to think for themselves and not get bullied by the Church or the Pope.

Libs ignore Benedict and cons ignore Francis. Vatican II can be a double-edged sword.	0

The question of the man on the raft is personal for me, because I spent several years on the river, living on its bank, fishing it, hunting its sloughs, and getting to know people over about a 150-mile stretch. I've visited some of the fish camps that were burned. I know their owners.  The river becomes its own community in summer.  Mutual help is taken for granted.  While the burning of properties obvious arouses alarm and suspicion, allowing communities along the river to take the law into their own hands regarding passengers on the river is asking for trouble. There was absolutely no legal basis for preventing this man from landing, as any other traveler on the river could. What happens on the river is not a tribal issue.  Anvik is not the private property of the people who live there.  It's public property of the State of Alaska.  State and federal law apply there--and the local people regularly seek the protection of those laws.  Jerrold Harrison should have the same protection.	0

Certainly you must know I'm right on this issue.  Many police departments have restricted police chases for this reason.   What's even more incredible , is that the stats show most police chases in most cases were over minor traffic violations . Of course anyone who runs from police is wrong to do so and the book should be thrown at them for doing it---however public safety should matter most---I'm not talking about the person running's health , but the innocent other's on the road who get killed during the chase.  Police and public safety is far better served by hanging back and catching the runner later. Cowboy police chases rarely turn out well .	0

Noelle, these traffic circles will be used in a different application than the ones in Sequim. The roundabouts in Sequim are on arterial streets at major intersections and used in place of stop lights and stop signs. The proposed traffic circles for this development will be smaller, located at uncontrolled intersections on Francis St., and will be used as a device to slow traffic in the neighborhood. You'll probably never have to use them unless you live in that neighborhood or are trying to cut through it- which brings us full circle. They're trying to prevent through traffic from speeding through the neighborhood or encourage them to use a different route altogether (I.e. Race/Peabody).   Beside the point, I would actually like to see some roundabouts in PA, as long as they are implemented correctly. If used in the right locations, and once people get used to them, they can move traffic along at a faster rate than stop signs and stop lights which helps reduce backups and congestion.	0

This is not 'Islamophobia', this is a huge concern of a culture that has entered Canada and shows no interest in integrating into the culture of Canada. No other culture has entered Canada and refused to integrate like the Muslim culture.  Don't use the word 'Islamophobia' and point fingers at Canadians, look to yourselves.	0

"I agree with Samuelson's 'solution'!  ""Under Mankiw’s proposal, the airline would have to offer passengers enough money so that four of them would decide to take the money or some combination of a free ticket and cash. Let’s assume that two passengers require $1,000 plus a free ticket, a third accepts a $1,200 buyout and the last sets a price of $1,500.  ""I would tweak Mankiw’s proposal by requiring that all the bumped passengers receive the highest payment. In this case, it’s $1,500. (On this issue, it’s not clear where Mankiw stands.) So the airline’s total cost would be $6,000, plus the cost of vouchers for new tickets. I would also put an upper limit for each passenger, calculated as some multiple of a full ticket price, but it would be high."""	0

People from Central America (except for Costa Rica), unless they are relatively wealthy, have an almost impossible time getting a visa.

Mr. Saunders seems to be completely unwilling to acknowledge the impacts of massive economic, social and demographic change. He seems to promote such change without acknowledging its inherent consequences. It's likely the breadth and extent of change that's creating other negative reactions in Europe and elsewhere in the developed world. The globalists have told ordinary people they can have no control over these supposedly inexorable forces. A reaction was inevitable, but I think it dangerous and likely inaccurate to conflate antisemitism with this reaction. Antisemitism, which is ingrained in some European cultures, may be on the upswing but it's not likely the defining or even a logically intrinsic characteristic of the antiglobalist response. It's more a consequence of the very forces Saunders likes to champion.	0

Slavery was not a American invention. The people who came from Africa as slaves to America were already African slaves and could have been sold to  African slave owners or to slave owners from other countries. If their is blame to go around it should be going to the African despots that allowed slavery to grow into the big business it became in Africa. I believe slavery is still going on in Africa today. The current temporary foreign worker programs is the modern day slavery.

The oil company coalition ruling the Senate wins by delaying.  The more they delay the more credits accrue for their corporate masters.

We have already spent a billion plus on the gas line.  Ten cents on the dollar to finish the job, one month after the EIS was submitted to FERC is just smart money.  BP, Exxon and Conoco want to kill it dead as it would compete with there other worldwide gas projects.  The House leadership is trying to get our fiscal house in order.  The Senate leadership is all about delay, delay, delay.  I think we have the very worst group of senators ever and that is saying a lot considering the crooks who have been elected.	0

Thanks, Brother.  After the election, I needed to take some time off, as I find the results, on many levels, profoundly disturbing. It is as if the fears I have been writing about for many years have taken a giant step towards being realized. I believe, what has happened could not have happened without the success of Limbaugh and Murdoch successfully  manipulating the darker angels of far too many. This has always frightened me. And to consider how many of the leaders of our own Church have either passively or actively worked in ways that have contributed to where we are is more than discouraging. Now I must find where it is I can become part of the solution. Yet, at this point, I don't quite know where that is.   Prayers for all,  John David	0

"I disagree, Reality77. In the private sector she or any public sector employee would be eligible for ""bonuses,"" which are often flat out gifts though, at the very least, they would require eligibility criteria. On what would you base eligibility for bonuses for supreme court judges? Who would decide? What about ""employee ownership"" or profit sharing incentives?  A defined benefit pension is nice. Who would deny it? But employees share the cost. My Canadian Forces pension cost me 7% of every paycheque I received (1968 - 1990). But not once was I in a position where I was eligible for a bonus or, if you can imagine, profit sharing. Even at the best of times."	0

Then why does it seem like every mall in the GTA is under construction, undergoing lavish renovations and adding endless numbers of high-end stores like Nordstrom and Saks?

"Where does this end? Do we move to quotas in all levels of business activity, and gov't? ""You must have x% female, you must have x% visible minority, you must have x% indigenous, you must.....""??  So much for hiring on the basis of merit. (BTW, that would mean that there are far too many females in University, we better do something about that.) Also, can we not recognize that we are making progress for once? The article claims boards are currently 14% female (which I totally get is too low), but it also states that 26% of new board vacancies are filled by females.  Is that not progress? I strongly believe that big businesses will do what is best for them.  Research clearly shows that having female input can be a great benefit to the organization (and I do not mean just the optics of it).  When the two top equal candidates are one woman and one man, in today's environment, the woman is going to get the job."	0

The main question for the community and for festival members is how the festival can move forward when neither its staff nor the UO leaders who compelled this change and communicated it have much credibility.

OK. Earlier political wonks, who go into politics young, study only political science (junk science?), and evade most other serious education, tested the idea of double decking and failed. So what? Government’s job is to serve us. Not rule “The Masses” for our own good. And we love our cars for good reasons.  Having lived in Boston w/o a car for 4 yrs when young, poor, and dumb here’s a few: Big Box transport is a perfect Flu incubator (also pandemic accelerator). Never sicker. Terrorists prefer victims pre-packaged in Big Box transport (e.g. 200 dead/2000 hurt in Spain train). One car at a time lacks impact. One Big Box breakdown -Line and all its branches lost. Intelligent cars muddle around it. It’s damn inconvenient, ‘cept maybe for promotors who see us clearing roads for them LAND in Hawaii is priceless. Double decking doubles it. Rail consumes it. Decking adds a covered lane for bikes and other cool wheeled things. We can build roads w/o building fortunes for CA Consultants &more	0
Trump came to Colorado, which is one more step than Hillary took.... in states she felt she had in her pocket.  Gore wasn't worthy. I'm glad we didn't see how his years turned out.  The EC was a brilliant compromise between a popular vote and a vote for President solely by representatives. Some representatives of the Continental Congress didn't think the masses should vote, as they're not as informed.   The EC was not designed to protect southern slave states, I'm sure you know, at the time, there were 13 colonies and all reprehensibly allowed slavery. There were no states then.   The EC is still the best option. It prevents large population states from totally controlling results of an election. California has more people than well over 20 of the least populous states combined. The top 10 most populated states have more than half the country's population in them. The power shouldn't rest in their hands to such a skewed extent, and thankfully, doesn't.	0
"How is this news? Denver Post really scraping the bottom of the barrel for anything. Are times so hard you'll print any press release, without considering whether the information is of value to society? All you did is give John Green a public forum to pat himself on the back, and drag a good man's name through mud.  Research the Medicare billing codes and you'll find a minuscule difference between the measurements, requiring accuracy down to the millimeter. Dr. Thomas spent his life in nursing homes, where most podiatrists won't go, providing a service to the elderly, whom most people have forgotten. It's not easy to measure to the millimeter when an elderly man is telling you what he experienced on Normandy Beach, because you're the only person that visits.  It's hilarious to hear an AG say ""Health care fraud is a serious crime that deserves time behind bars"" when Wells Fargo fraud criminals are walking free and drug companies can charge $750 per pill for live-saving medicine."	0

I doubt if any of us are free of embarrassment for things we thought were said in privacy.     How would the release of conversation with Trump and Banon come across, such as Bannon's forecast of the envitable cyclical global war.     The release of those tapes meant zilch to me and most folks who voted.    Democratic protest ring as a shallow excuse honestly.  I'm not overly concerned that Russia tried to interfere in our political campaign.    We know for fact that our own country has done much worse in an attempt to influence 'regime change'.     Now if there is proof that the Trump campaign and the Russians coordinated the release of tapes, then Trump should be impeached.     Not saying it's true or false, but if proven true, I don't see an alternative.	0

Well, everyone is racist if that's the word we use for seeing the 'other' as different and being potentially hostile or dismissive to the 'other'.  Of not wanting to have to deal with the 'other'.  I don't think this is a white issue, but human even primal issue.  We speak more of white racism, because in first world countries white people are a majority, and thus wield more power - if roles were reversed, and some other racial group was in power and the majority, the racism we'd focus on would be theirs.    Recognizing this factor of human nature, and building in rules and controls against it so that people do not mistreat other people has been a huge step forward for western civilization.  And given time and a less divisive discourse, in the end the 'other' will be 'one of us'.	0

I like looking at the Salem City Charter (www.cityofsalem.net/Pages/city-charter.aspx) as it reflects a different approach as to who the hell is in charge. Professional experience and yes pay grades are way above ours, but then they're professionals who tell their City Manager what to do. In our City Charter is says the Council may only SUGGEST to the City Manager. CHANGE the power structure of the Eugene Charter, get city council/mayor professionals in place and let them bring in a 'larger city' manager who communicates with the public. NOW- Our course, make all your pretty design concepts for a Farmers Market and City Hall, but until Lane County can 'get around' the Skinner Donation Land Deed, it's all fantasy. LANE COUNTY has lost twice to get the old city hall lot; by a judge and then the legislature. Official City Hall might be a building 'guest' of Lane County's for 4+ years, but it's still a non-county purpose as is a full-time market and a new City Hall on county property.	0

"A good article by the Examiner, and one that needs to be repeated in congress. I don't understand why Republicans let demagogues get away with fallacious statements by Democrat critics like some of the things the article points out. Republicans always seem to let the opposition control the dialogue. Another thing I find disingenuous is costing Bills out over a ten year period, which cannot predict any unknown variables that may occur over that period of time. It's time to do away with ""budget scoring"" as a future predictor. The figures usually end up being wrong anyway. Every Law should have review after a period of time after it's inception to see if it's working as written, or if it needs to be amended, or abolished."	0

"""The Legislature should amend HRS 291C-33 to conform to reasonable pedestrian expectations by making the flashing red or countdown a warning only.""   It would be a good idea to discuss this.

The problem is that the white phase is simply too short.

Sears made the mistake of not becoming land owners and landlords. It is not retailers who make money these days but landlords of retailers. For 50 years they paid rent to the mall owners - they should have been the mall owner. At what point do landlords realize that a high enough % of retail sales have moved online and the landlords need to lower rents otherwise no retailer, no matter how excellent, will be able to pay the rents they demand. Malls are converting empty retail space into other tenants like medical clinics etc. but they have not lowered rents to keep their tenants in business.  The federal government has lowered corporate taxes - I can tell you the landlords are thinking they want some of the retailers tax savings to go to their pockets.	0

"In very one of these cases, its revealed that the driver also had unspecified levels of booze, tranquilizers and/or opiates.  People on opiates just nod off, and fall asleep while driving,  and tranquilizers impair driving nearly as much as alcohol.   While cannabis also causes impairment, the effects are much less severe than booze or pills. Since THC has a half-life of about 30-45 minutes, impairment related to THC generally dissipates much quicker than impairment related to alcohol or pills.     Driving impaired is by definition dangerous and irresponsible, but it  requires a credible impairment levels.  In 1993, the NHTSA studied the effects of THC on driving impairment, finding ""a moderate THC dose of 100 ng/mg"" has minor impairment effects,  and as a consequence,   ""THC's adverse effects on driving appear relatively small"".    Doesn't it seem odd that the impairment level for THC dropped from 100 ng down to 5 ng, remained constant for  alcohol."	0

"The only civil rights you posses as a matter of law are in the Constitution.  The Constitution is a law which was proposed by an assembly and adopted by elective processes.  As a matter of fact, not hopeful suppositions, civil rights ARE contingent upon the whims of a tyrannical majority and decided by a vote - in the case of constitutional amendments a supermajority.  You are correct the the Federal judiciary has decided it is empowered to ""interpret for each new generation"", which of course itself is not constitutional.  Two major decisions which were being considered by the electorate pursuant to their constitutional rights to legislate were trumped by a majority of a nine person panel based on whimsical notions of what they considered to be good ideas - abortion and same sex marriage.  That tendency to legislate can be reined in not just by appointments but by amendment.  Interestingly the very thing which does protect civil rights without the Constitution are natural rights."	0

"1) As stated above, criminals DO NOT CARE about government rules for guns. They are thrilled we are getting our rights stripped away.

"[If someone has their teenager sell drugs for them is the kid totally innocent?] Under US law, yes.  There needs to be some evidence of intent to act in a way that violates the law.

[These are older kids running across the boarder... They knew.] Source?  There is no way to conclude ""these are older kids"" without evidence when a lot (if not most) of them filed seven years ago when DACA was first introduced.  If the ""16 to 25 years old"" clients mentioned above would put them from six to fifteen years old.

I read the headline as well as the article. Quite frankly put, Ms Dawson's impending retirement is long over due.

In what is a rare agreement among economists, rent control exacerbates the supply problem for housing by reducing availability.

"JPZ, every analysis I've seen shows the market beats SS over the long term. Most your points have nothing to do with sound retirement strategies.  ""Too much depends on when the market hit's it's eventual slump"" ... so true. This is why it a good idea to be largely transitioned out of stocks by retirement. Strategies vary, but most recommend trimming an 80/20 stock/bond holding to 20/80 during the 10 years before you retire.  And you're talking about losing money by piling in when the market is high -- yes this happens time and time again. Watched my mom sell her $50k in mutual funds for $25k in 2008 because the rapid 50% ""loss"" scared her... fact is her sell decision made it into a loss; it would be worth over $100k now if she had held it.  This is how dollar cost averaging--trickling money in no matter what the market is doing--works. That way you buy more when the market is down then when it is up and leaves fear psychology out of it."	0
"Nanakuli,  You should make an attempt to learn the difference between murder committed because of peceived grievances toward individuals (the Uyesugi killings by far Hawaii's and possibly the rest of the USA's best example) and murder to make a political point or to address an issue with a society or other large group.

The thing about dual citizenship is that it often isn't the choice of the 'citizen'.  Some countries such as Iran and China do not allow you to renounce their citizenship.  Some countries require difficult and expensive processes to give it up and even then it's at their discretion (I believe Egypt is one of those).  Other countries require you give up their citizenship if you taken a second citizenship (e.g. Japan).  So it's very complicated.  To assert that a naturalized Canadian citizen  must reside permanently in Canada creates a dual class of citizenship.	0

I still say that now Vegas will be a target for other terrorism acts, especially with Isis, etc., just to prove we are still vulnerable and if it happens again, then then the city/casinos will have to agree to (pay) for a roving/visible 24/7 super swat team (several hundred members) with heavy firepower to deter acts even more.  I think that the visitors will grow used to this protection, as persistent heavily armed police presence is already occurring in cities and airports around the world.  I personally would feel safer seeing them than not.  If anyone can afford this, it would be Vegas.  However, I often wondered about the Strip, that anyone can drive a suicide bomb in down the road and set it off at any time, killing hundreds, if not a thousand at the right time.  How exactly do they defend against that, unless they search every vehicle and gridlock traffic?  Some day I can see where they will shut the road down and create a huge pedestrian mall and/or have secured transportation.	0
"Although I like very much what you say, I believe the true issue here is not justification for or against Rail.  We are not in Church more suited to morals and neighborly assistance.  Nor are we in College were philosophical debates courageously rage for glory.  We are simply talking about the business of doing business.  Developing Rail is firstly business.  It's immaterial whether a politician or a private individual initiated the project.  This ""rose"" by any other name is still business.  The first requirement for business is FULL accounting.  Business cannot be allowed to otherwise proceed, because any kind of pro-forma (financial forecast) cannot exist otherwise.  Accounting is static and NOT finance, which is dynamic.  Accounting is a snapshot of history.  A detailed, accurate, full history is always required for business.  The lack of accounting is the issue, not whether money is more needed to build instead.  It's purely the principle of business that should never be ignored."	0

Nixon was forced to respond to the triple whammy of a rampant civil rights movement, a powerful anti-war movement, and an effective environmental revolution, whatever his other faults:  One can only hope that Trump, with his autocratic and divisive style, sparks such revolutions and is forced, as a servant of the public, to respond to them in kind.  The difference is that back then the media was more diversified in ownership, and public movements were able to gain control of its coverage to their advantage.

That very year Ethiopia had more agricultural EXPORTS than at any time in its history.  But it was all cotton.  Every square inch of arable Ethiopian land was planted in cotton for export to the Russian social-imperialists' textile mills.  Ethiopia's puppet government starved their own people to produce cotton for Russia.  They're not the only ones.

"Russia is stepping up trade with NK and replacing oil shipments which China is curtailing, thereby making a mockery of the ""sanctions"" designed to rein in Kim's WMD/missile programs.  Additionally, Russia takes about 100K NK slave laborers per year; their wages also go to NK's WMD/missile programs.  Putin threatened thermonuclear war if the West tried to intervene in Crimea;  he is upgrading significantly every branch of the Russian military while engaging in reckless provocations against the West -- large troop maneuvers on Eastern European borders, having SU-27s buzz NATO aircraft.  Putin has forged alliances with arch U.S. enemies: Iran, Pakistan, Syria, NK, Venezuela, et al to weaken US influence around the world.  Although no evidence exists to suggest that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, it is clear that the Russians did try to influence the U.S. election, just as they attempted to sway the French election and others.

"Neoclassical economics is not the enemy.  Human nature is not the enemy.

Not that this is an exclusively Catholic issue, since most religious institutions are deeply patriarchal as a consequence of original sin (Genesis 3:16). But the Catholic Church DOES CONTRIBUTE to perpetuate this misery by resisting the ordination of women to the priesthood and the episcopate.

Have we learned nothing from Common Core? Do want your Teachers to teach to a test, or to educate their Students.

I, for one, beg to differ. I think the jury's been in for a long, long time.

Having nuclear weapons virtually ensures that a country will not be attacked. Countries without nuclear weapons have been attacked by the US which has nuclear weapons.

"Here's what John doesn't yet understand.    Let me try this again, if not for John, then for others who might be curious what the Catholic Church teaches about suffering, pain, and intimate union with God (see Salvivici Doloris for some very beautiful writing & teaching on this matter).   St Paul is talking about deep & intimate unity with Jesus Christ, in fact a total and trusting abandonment into His care, and a oneness with the will of God.  His motives are our motives.  St Paul is ""rejoicing"" in the sufferings that God is allowing for the good of others.  He is imitating Jesus Christ, even in suffering.   One can't do that without a ready presence (influence) of God,  a lively interior life.  As I said, John doesn't yet have the integrality of Scripture needed to fit such matters together, how ""happiness & pain"" are not at odds.    How one can actually rejoice while suffering.   Jesus sang the Psalms on His way to Calvary.  So can we, so should we if we want an ever closer union."	0

The federal Liberal Party is no longer. It has no membership base, at least a paid membership. The nomination process is controlled by the prime minister's office.

"This is so ironic:  ""Locke said that ... anti-fluoridation activists have targeted Port Angeles ever since 2006 ...""  PA's water got fluoridated in 2006 because outside pro-fluoridation activists had moved in on us, armed with big money and obsolete science.  Our political resistance to this boneheaded and venal decision has been headed from the beginning by a genuine local  --  and genuine expert.    And look at these comments.  As usual, it's a ""debate"" between local PDN readers (who actually drink PA water) and a ""rapid response team"" of out-of-State pro-fluoride zealots who comment voluminously everywhere water fluoridation is discussed.    So far, the locals seem to be outnumbering (and out-arguing) the fluoride trolls here  --  usually, that means the next level of fluoride thought police shows up and starts insulting the locals right and left.  Maybe this time they'll surprise me and let us discuss  our local water locally.   <G> Yeah, right."	0

Agreed. Taking a percentage of your employment income as the required income assumes you spend all of your income today. If your employment income exceeds your needs, then, obviously, you will not need to replace all of it.

Here's the problem with her refuting human causation for Climate Change:  It demonstrates a clear willingness to refute and/or ignor overwhelming scientific evidence to advance the political agenda of her flawed appointer.  Can this sort of mental gymnastics replicate itself as to, for instance, questions of Russian conduct as it may impact National (Homeland) Security?    Can this sort of political expediency of thought translate into looking or focusing in the wrong direction as to threats to our safety?  Can this sort of sophistry translate into questions of policy choices colored by race?  or religion? or protection of certain high(est) ranking politician's children?  Seems like the answer is yes.    We need our law enforcement and national security officials to be nonpartisan, measured, balanced and sane.  The flaw evident in this nominee is HUGE.	0

One element missing from this article is the way in which gutting Medicaid will increase costs for the rest of us. When an individual presents at hospital with liver or kidney failure, the hospital treats them and that treatment is not cheap. Under the current system, they are almost certainly insured - often by Medicaid. Under the proposed system (reduced Medicaid, ending the subsidies for private insurance), they often won't be. The result:  hospitals will go back to doubling or tripling their charges so that the patients who can pay can cover the patients who can't.	0

No.  Whenever something crime related happens in Anchorage these days how many people come to ADN and immediately post comments about repealing SB91 or want the police and/ or mayor's office to offer solutions, or just state they are sick and tired of all the crime?

Did a little research on the new Hep-c 'cure'.  A drug cocktail used for 12 weeks which eliminated the virus from the bloodstream completely in trials.  The catch is the FDA still hasn't approved it and the 12 week drug treatment costs a minimum of $84,000.    Fancy drugs with a lot of R&D from several pharmaceutical companies which cost a whole lot of money.  Mostly for one company buying another company to get the patent rights because the individual drugs have been around for years.  It is the cocktail combination.  Obviously the insurance companies don't want to touch it because of cost and the patients usually are poor so no copay ability so there is a big question of practicality.  However consider this:  In Egypt, which has the world's highest rate of hepatitis C, sofosbuvir costs $300 for a 28-day supply.  (http://www.scientificamerican.com/)  2 things; Muslims don't do drugs?  Why $83,700 less in Egypt?   Something is totally rotten somewhere!!	0

This is all affordable.  If we could afford to spend $5 trillion on wars in Iran and Afghanistan we can afford to invest in making America a more just society.  Specifically we need to stop the uber-rich from becoming an entrenched self-perpetuating plutocracy.  Inheritance taxes should start at around $2 million and progressively claw back more: anything over, say, $1 billion should be subject to 90% tax.  Tax breaks that favor investment over labor have to go – interest, dividends and capital gains income should be taxed at the same rate as income from, you know, work.  The cap on Social Security contributions should be eliminated. Tax breaks for employer-sponsored health plans and defined contribution retirement plans have to go.  Same for the charitable deduction which only upper middle class folks who itemize are able to benefit from.  Finally we need a carbon tax – that’s about cross-generational fairness.	0
"""May 16, 2013: Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) suggested there was not enough security in Benghazi because Republicans had cut the budget for embassy security funding. But this claim was not credible and highly partisan. Democrats had also short-changed the State Department budget (compared to presidential requests), but funding for embassy security generally had increased significantly in recent years. Moreover, over the course of many hearings into the matter, State Department officials had told Congress that a lack of funds was not an issue. Instead, security was hampered because of bureaucratic issues and management failures. In other words, given the internal failures, no amount of money for the State Department likely would have made a difference in this tragedy.

One issue with Trump that I thought was curious was that he wanted to simplify taxes. That sounds good. But it looked like one of his ways of simplifying taxes was to reduce the number of tax rates (from his web site ""All other Americans will get a simpler tax code with four brackets – 0%, 10%, 20% and 25% – instead of the current seven."") I don't think the tax code is complex because there are 7 brackets instead of 4! It is all the deductions and exceptions. Anyway, he has more to the plan but that just struck me as strange."	0

Andrew Gomes' greatest accomplishment with his excellent piece of editorial investigation was to bring awareness of the quiet title situation to those most directly affected by it.

As the report says, ""When he or she [the public school student] reaches grade 11, they may be part of the 53% proficient in reading or part of the 47% that is not proficient When he or she [the public school student] reaches grade 11, they may be part of the 30% proficient in math or part of the 70% that is not proficient""  Translated means that we're graduating a lot of kids out of high school that can't read, write, or do simple math.

I bought a 2014 VW Touareg TDI to pull the boat, but it has become the go to car over the Lexus gas machine, it is just so much cheaper to run the Diesel. About 22% all in and when Diesel cost less than gas well it is even better. It is unfortunate Canada has become a part of the US car market because the American's hate Diesel and the car companies like to sell a reduced set of the US options hear in Canada. The worst of both worlds.  The US big oil make more money selling the higher cost gasoline. They have built there oil complex based on it so they are now killing diesel cars/SUV's in Canada. To bad really as I was looking to upgrade to get all the safety features and nobody wants to sell a diesel. My replacement SUV will not happen for a long time, and of course I will get to drive the Diesel options in Europe when I winter there.	0

Dear Merrie-Susan Marchant We, www.HawaiianHope.org have proposed the showers, bathrooms and laundry to city council about 5 times since 2009. I have the emails,  testimony and PDF's to prove it. I have met with various past and present city council members and talked at length about this. We have offered to provide the services and run the facilities - at NO cost to the city - we just need the physical space to do it. All we get is talk and referrals running in circles, not a single piece of action. The same city (and state) buildings sitting EMPTY for at LEAST 7 years now.  More recently I was even told I would have to bid on our own proposal / project if it was even considered.  If anyone out there has space that we can use (4,000 - 30,000 square feet - or more) and wants to get serious about doing something to solve the problem, contact us. We will show you a plan that takes the problem head on, and will work. We guarantee you some pretty cool PR and a LOT of VERY grateful people.	0

I am disappointed to note that editorial hubris reached all time record high with on-going assault on readers with these repeated inane gender war articles.  To address this topic - sexual assault became normative only due and as a result of definition creep.

Sexual Assault ought to be reserved for serious crimes, however this have not been the case for quite some time.	0
"The initiative, like the referendum and the recall, is included in, and protected by, both the US Constitution and Oregon's Constitution.  The definition and the process relating to initiatives in Oregon are very clearly defined in the Oregon Revised Statutes.  There is no ""confusion about the process"".    A coalition of ""farming and timber interests"" (Ms Bower's phrase, not mine) are supporting an effort to CHANGE that process by the LCBC granting itself the authority to preemptively ""veto"" a proposed initiative by refusing to certify it for the initiative process.  The measure would grant the Board the power to ""pick and choose"" which initiatives they would allow to move forward.  The measure directly violates the very principle of direct democracy; the power of the citizenry to seek redress w/o permission from a governing body. The proposed measure has already been declared unconstitutional in Lane County Circuit Court.    If unhappy, supporters should appeal that decision......"	0

"There is a huge difference between the proposition(s) in the verses you quoted and what the so-called doctrine of perfectionism actually teaches.  There is also a huge difference between ""doing no evil"" and ""being perfect."" Perfect is just perfect. There is no ""almost perfect,"" the same way there is also no ""almost pregnant"" or ""a little pregnant.""  The sanctification process is a journey of growing spiritually, and it will never end up until the parousia, which is when Glorification will happen - by the merits of Christ, not based on anything the saved will be able to present as ""their perfection.""  This is the problem with the perfectionism claims, it makes people to pursue something they can never attain. It's a false teaching, aka heresy, that has been consistently rejected in our church since inception. At least until now - and this is what concerns me the most with the current administration that appears to support it. LGT is a fancy name that may deceive many."	0

"If you saw my earlier post, this fits right in with my predicted justification for why it is working: “No one drives on Willamette anymore. It’s too crowded.” I think there may be less traffic than say, in October, but the City is measuring that. Another perceptual aspect is that it may ""feel"" like less traffic because it's working.  What we had before was more like taking a group of soldiers and saying, ""everyone through the canyon as fast as you can"". Now, no one can speed by another motorist.  As far as bikes, critics said that there were not bikes on Willamette, so why put in bike lanes. Then they said, if we put in bike lanes there would be too many bikes. So which is it? I am sure more bikes will make things slow down. But then each bike is one less car, and each car takes up 7 times the space of a bike.  It comes down to trade-offs. Shall we eliminate bikes, make it hard for pedestrians and continue 24 accidents a year because the current three-lane design has it's own problems?"	0

All you re seeing are the negatives. I'm sure there are lots of positives in your area, people who are living local culture--especially on the Leeward Coast. Much of what you are talking about is most likely caused by the economy which has never recovered for the majority of people and has put many into despair and doing whatever they can to dull the pain and survive. This despair is felt by many of us due to the ineffectiveness of our state government to work with and help the local community rather than helping the large corporations and foreign investors, all the while taking profits from these entities who don't care about the people who have been shown to have no real voice in the decisions our govt makes.

Many deaths have been cause by opposition violence who have admitted  waging a program of economic boycott and sabotage against the Maduro Gov.

Without more severe caps on king take in the Bering Sea pollock trawl fishery, you will not see an increase in kings coming back to their fish streams. What we do need is a closure of the pollock fishery until the NPFMC comes up with an excluder system that can actually work to divert healthy kings back into the waters after being caught up in the trawls.   Managing the fishery AFTER we get them back to our streams is another issue and should be managed by a joint management plan by the Tribes affected, the state, and the feds.	0
This news article explains that it was a plea bargain deal Tom.   In order to save the government the cost of a trial, he was offered a reduced charge and sentence.   Plea bargains are very common these days, even for major crimes, due to so many local governments being broke around our nation.   The Lane County DA's office does this all the time with local criminals.  His lawyer was going to argue in court that the killing was an accident:  that he only meant to choke her into being unconscious, and not dead.   That sounds like a concocted defense to me, though.   I, myself, would be hard pressed to believe such an excuse unless there was really compelling evidence to back the claim up.	0
"Canadians weren't consulted over Pierre Trudeau's massive ""multicultural"" immigration,-- whose real purpose was to dilute pure laine votes in Québec, while paternalistically leaning on allophones for Liberal votes.  Likewise, Americans weren't consulted over the reckless immigration policies of Obama, which were latterly a naked effort at recruiting Democrat voters.  The author's arguments are all about moral exhibitionism. Whether it's driven by NGOs busking for funding or cynical identity-politics, the public gets undemocratically shafted in the cost and further stretching of overtaxed public services.  President Donald J. Trump ran on a platform of tightening the vetting of immigrants to make America secure. Most Americans don't want to be flooded with refugees.

Wars, especially civil wars are brutal often because it's an internal struggle with so much at stake for either side. Most countries in the Middle East as we've all witnessed over the last 40 years or so going back to Israel and Lebanon, (remember the civil war in Lebanon, far more brutal in my opinion and lasted 15 years!) are simply not prepared or equipped to be democracies as we know it or we wish.  99.9% of westerners could never possibly understand the Sunni/Shia divide, we just like to think we can and try to impose our will on them.

We cannot 'erase' the past. Covering it up is a form of erasure and risks further historical ignorance if not further revisionism. Better would be to apologise, learn from the past such that it is not repeated and uphold the actual detail existing legal treaties signed between crown and native groups. Once the current treaties are adhered to, then we could begin to look at forming a new relationship with native Canadians.  If anything this statue should be moved to a less prominent position and come with additional plaques describing Cornwallis' and settlers actions vis-a-vis the Mi'kmaq and other tribes.  This would serve as a reminder of the dangers of human pride, ignorance and evil.  But removing all traces of Canada's colonial past, good and bad,  is silly and counterproductive.	0

North Slope producers had been making diesel safely for Prudhoe and Kuparik use for over 40 years.  After some of the diesel is removed from the crude, the residual is put back into TAP's. 1890's refiners in the original oil fields of PA, stripped out the kerosene and dumped the residual crude on the ground.  The number of vehicles using diesel on the Slope number in the hundreds, not thousands.  To have idiot regulators at the EPA insist on a national low sulfur rule, without considering exceptional places like AK, exceptional usage rates like the North Slope and the exceptional cost/benefit of enforcing this dumb rule is an absolute crime.  The damage to the environment due to roll overs on the road to Deadhorse will never be offset by the savings on the minor amount of airborne sulfur dioxide released in the Arctic.  Time for some common sense, I did not vote for The Donald, but I sure hope he can fix this stupidity by the EPA.  These accidents are a direct result of EPA rules.	0
The Deepwater Horizon spill occurred far offshore in federal waters. It occurred in ultra deep water.

Nonsense. Western nations, including the US, pride themselves much more about division of church and state and/or their secularism than their Christian heritage.    In the US the church-state separation is not only part of the Constitution, but practically speaking, it is a preamble to the Ten Commandments.   JPII pleaded, argued with EU leaders for a decade to include 'some' reference to Christian hereitage in the Preamble of the new EU Constitution (only the Preamble, not th Constitution itself) to no avail.   To compare this to Islam, where church-state separation is a sign of weak religious commitment, or religious laxity, shows a lack of understanding and, as such, it I s simply nonsense.	0

So srobertsoo instead of just posting a disagree emoji how about explaining why you disagree with the two very short sentences I posted?  Do you contend that physical assault cases don't usually have visible evidence (cuts, bruises scratches or worse)?  Or do you contend that sexual assault cases  do show physical evidence as much as physical assault cases? Given that sexual assault can be something physically mild (stolen kiss, or a touch in an unwanted place etc.) that wouldn't leave traces I think you will have a hard time making that case too. If you can't come up with something reasonable then the only thing I can think of is that you just don't like the facts but have no way to refute their legitimacy.	0

Gary, I think you're wrong on this. If the winner of the presidential election was based on the winner of the national vote, then every vote would count, not just those in the swing states.

That would all change if every vote moved a candidate closer to 270, regardless of where that vote was cast.	0

The Catholic Church makes no distinctions as to value as a human life from conception to death, none. It teaches that abortion is grievous sin, a sin which cries to Heaven for justice.

“The border is complicated, as far as building a physical wall,” Zinke said at an event held by the Public Lands Council, according to E&E News.    He went on to say, “The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you going to put the wall? We’re not going to put it on our side and cede the river to Mexico.    And we’re probably not going to put it in the middle of the river.”  Zinke’s answer to that problem was similar to Bannon treating the members of the Freedom Caucus like a child who can be ordered to comply with your wishes.   Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed Tuesday that the U.S. build its border wall on Mexico’s side of the border.   Of course, there is that little problem of sovereignty to contend with!   It was easily one of the most ridiculous things I’ve heard from Trump or any of his associates. I doubt that Mexico will respond any differently to that idea than the Freedom Caucus member did to Bannon.	0

It is hard to say the reasons for another mans actions.    The funds should be used to support the needs of Alaska, as a transition to a state funded by lower oil revenues takes place.  The size and scope of the state itself and it's government will be smaller as oil activity and revenue decline.  Currently our state government is massive and still growing.  Unless we think we are going to fall into another Prudhoe Bay, we need to realize that we are not going to continue rapid grow indefinitely. We need to start the transition to lower government spending before we move to using the PFD.  A less wealthy Alaska will result in the end of many of the companies this article is about.  Postponing this day of reckoning is the goal of Walker and his ilk.  If they have there way, they will spend every dime of savings on more activity they can profit from.  However, it would be best if we confront this leaner future today, while our reserves are fresh and powder dry.	0

"Whether a woman was ""prominent"" or ""emerged as a leader"" is beside the point. Considering the patriarchal times in which they lived, it's a miracle that even one or two female figures made it to the Book. During my formative years in the Church there were several good priests and many,many good Catholic women who mentored or led me as needed at the time. Most of them have either died or ""disappeared"" and their names will never be mentioned beyond the oral histories of their own families. The point is those women (and men) were so inspired by the Spirit of the Lord that they made an enormous difference in my life then and continue to inspire me now. They were Church for me. In these more enlightened times and considering the fullness of women's  contributions down through the ages,  bickering about the propriety of their  insurgence into more prominent leadership, such as the diaconate, seems a bid absurd."	0

"I appreciate you fielding my post so courteously and classily.  But you said something I'm going to take off on. Gettting ""more"" is not necessarily good.  The Conservative mindset that More, or Bigger, or Louder is good or desirable is wrongheaded. Quality is a key. Responsible building or exapnsion a necessary component of growth. Care and attention to consequence must go into the noise made. When more, bigger and louder reflects those qualities, there is universal (bipartisan) acceptance. Conservatives' problem, who Trump is perhaps turning into a walking, talking (too much), metaphor for, is that in their arguably (and in my view) self centered and selfish view of the world, More is awesome in and of itself (damn the consequences - to the poor, environment, etc.).  Bigger is good (more military, more merger and acquisition, more, more more).  And, Louder is perhaps THE most admirable trait (Limbaugh?  Hannity? Soon to be Comm. Dir.  Stephen ""Mr. Obnoxious"" Miller?). Change is needed"	0

"Thank you for your posts and those of AnneMargaret in this string.   The points you both make are helping me work through the role of the priest in this process of discernment.  I have been rather stuck on the idea that Francis is requiring a priests okay, a priests acceptance of the discernment made by the remarried Catholic.  I do think ultimately the discernment is that of the individual and the role of the priest is that of helper.  But, I also think that some people don't really need some sort of agreement from a priest - a seal of approval - they have already reached an understanding that they are walking a path of faith in a new marriage, that ""solace of conscience"".    It is hard to break habits of thought and untether thinking that ties both mercy and faith to the law of the Church.  And scary."	0
"""Trump’s seriousness about the details of governing can be measured by his decision to be abroad when his budget was released.""  You gotta love the left!

But Dionne thinks he should have been at home instead when his initial budget document was sent over to Congress.  And his failure to personally hand over his proposed budget means he isn't 'serious'."	0

"""That Reformation you celebrated is known for being open to change over time, over centuries — and that includes an openness to women pastors, priests, ministers, bishops and even archbishops.""  I imagine the Protestant churches that do not ordain women, including various Lutheran churches and the Southern Baptist Convention (the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S.) would disagree with this assessment. In fact, I think most of the reformers would have thought that they were returning to the original faith of the Bible, getting ride of what they believed were non-Biblical changes that accreted over time, instead of starting a process that allowed for new changes."	0

Offer a drug with absolutely no control over the dose (one glass, three glasses, eight glasses, who knows?).  3.

I would echo the advice to dispose of the billboards. I can imagine that there are many complications related to owning these US-based properties as well as tax issues to deal with in both countries.

Sorry in our society people are denied treatments all the time due to their own actions. Obese people and those who smoke or chronically drink are refused services such as operations or a family doctor. There are addicts overdosing 7 times in one day and using all the associated social resources that entails. It is fine for us to lose sympathy for them. Do you feel more sympathy for a child who has cancer or a long term unrepentant smoker? Do you donate to the Make a Wish foundation to send the smoker to Disney land? Nope. They don't even get operations many times because the resources would be wasted. Alcoholics don't get organ transplants. Its fine. It's how our society works. People are free to make their own choices and should be free to suffer the consequences of those actions. It's not a safe, legal or approved substance they are taking.	0

Justin Trudeau's statements quoted in this article are arguably part of a concerted effort by leaders in the UK, Germany, France, Canada, undoubtedly other nations, and elements within the fractious Trump Administration to stitch together a stable, moderate and concerted international effort (with consistent US commitment and support) to bring some stability, justice and peace to the Syria/Iraq chaos.    This effort downplays the idiocentric, irresponsible, vituperative and contradictory pattern of Trump's comments and actions while candidate and as President to date regarding Syria/Iraq and tries to fill the policy void that now exists in the wake of the one-off, ad hoc naval attack the Trump ordered without consultation and seriously at odds with his prior expressed views.  There is much merit in this effort and one can only hope that it isn't upended by some midnight tweet from himself.	0

"My point was meant to be that the writer is basically calling Trump a liar and then using logic that an EPA job is the same as as a production job that produces energy to heat homes., etc. Faulty logic used to call him a liar. Even if the extreme where you would try to argue they are of similar value, a reasonable person could see the logic rather than to demonize him for ""Rhetoric rather than ""facts"". A job that produces energy far outweighs one that does not. The regulator lives off of a percentage of the producer's efforts. Thereby, like a leech, sucking the lifeblood from its host, who eventually turns from healthy to unhealthy as more and more leeches pile on to the feeding trough."	0

Monica...I could well be wrong....but I think AL did suggest that the Church can work with divorced and remarried folks relative to both the internal forum and sacrament reception, and by extension their Church status.  I am sure the Church supports sacramental marriages and is saddened if that doesn't work out....but in the case of divorce and remarriage, the remarriage/Eucharist reception deal has been addressed in part by AL, the Internal forum and the personal consciences of those concerned.  Francis has said repeatedly that these situations are highly individualized and don't admit of a 'one size fits all' deal.....think you can say that to your folks?	0

If you really think that a ban religious attire is the same as an employer's dress code, you must have completely glossed over the entire point of the editorial.

I totally agree about the need among Americans to appreciate what they have and look at our issues with gratitude and patience. We absolutely should stop blindly attacking each other, spreading hatred and division while making excuses for our personal problems and clamoring for Washington to supply band-aids for their self-inflicted wounds. As a nation, it would behoove us to start taking genuine responsibility for ourselves.  And yes, there is far too much racist, xenophobic, and classist rhetoric, on all sides and in every strata. We need to stop shouting each other down and attempt to LISTEN to one another and dare I say it- COMPROMISE. The country exists for all citizens, not just the people you agree with.  However, there are legitimately good reasons to be angry- a lot; it's that we're mad for silly reasons and at the wrong people!

Neither Siemian or Lynch looked great or inspiring, but at least they're not Mike Glennon. On the O-line, Watson looked horrible and made too many rookie mistakes for a veteran. We might be seeing Barbre soon at RT. Bolles looked good for a rookie, so that's promising. The Defense looked stout as usual. Before anyone annoints Sloter as the new starter,  remember he was playing against 3rd/4th/5th string guys who won't be in the NFL next week, so temper the expectations.

Perhaps the measures would be an easier sell if state leadership didn't have such a checkered history in telling the taxpayer the truth. Many of the programs that they have sold the taxpayer in this state have come with the story that if implemented, and over the long haul, this or that program will afford us with the necessary controls and tools to bring spending into line, and that those savings might even allow this program to be self sustaining. Never happens, without fail, within a few years the fiscal hole is growing deeper.  Why then would the taxpayer be foolish enough to believe that given the chance they have now found some magic bullet that will cure it all, when all they more than likely will achieve is the purchase of new and better shovels to dig the pit deeper. Sorry but I'm not buying in.

The Minister and the media are doing children in Ontario a grave disservice by pretending that financial literacy education is included in the elementary curriculum. It is shameful! Ms. Hunter is very aware that, with so few references to anything 'money' in the curriculum, her claims of 'integration' or 'embedding' are - to be perfectly blunt - false.  Efforts to garner points politically have left elementary students in a worse position now than they were in 2011 [before the so-called financial literacy curriculum integration took place]. Parents are being duped into believing that the school system is hard at work helping their children to learn about money - and this is and has been proven not to be the case.   Please get in touch if you would like a copy of a research paper entitled 'An Evaluation of Financial Literacy Integration into the Ontario Elementary Education System, November 2016 -Tricia Barry, Imo Ek-Udofia'   Tricia Barry, Executive Director, Money School Canada	0

Adding to Alaska's problems are liberal democrats  . They fight the projects that would employ thousands of Alaskan's . They are against Pebble , against logging in southeast Alaska where they are happy to let tree's die where they stand to save an owl , they fight against increased oil exploration which is the economic life blood of Alaska ,  they are against increased military spending which has always boosted Alaska's economy.  They mock bridges that create jobs and open up affordable home sites .To they're shameful credit , they are all for Planned Parenthood who organizes the deaths of thousands of innocent nearly born Alaskan's through abortion to the tune of over a thousand a year.  Those thousand won't be looking for a job . Liberal democrats also push to allow thousands of refugee's to move to Alaska , as we don't have enough jobs and affordable homes for American's who are already here.  Trump is our best hope to turn the Alaska and U.S. economy around--as liberals fight him.	0

The latest scientific predictions are for an exponential rise in sea level, arriving far sooner than previously predicted. Why is the City building Rail there?  The City totally lied about this in the Final EIS.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H2QPwg8wcs  Most of the entire HART rail construction geology is in very porous ancient coral limestone reef karst with known subsurface caves and waterways. No amount of concrete sea walls will prevent the rise of the ocean which will push ahead of it ground water which will turn rail stations, parking lots, access points into swampland, corroding electrical systems, water and sewer pipes - all which could have been prevented by locating the route outside of floods, hurricane storm surge, tsunamis and rapidly rising sea levels."	1
"Liz Vasquez wants to distract us from the fact that she is a Republican posing as ""fiscally conservative"" but is really a big spender- especially on lavish legislative perks, like stuffing thousands of dollars in per diem payments in excess of their actual lodging and meal costs, while cutting public safety, the University, and seniors.  http://akleg.gov/docs/pdf/2015TravelReport.pdf  For example, in the 90 day 2015 session, Rep. Vasquez claimed- at a rate of $237/day- $25,759 in per diem- tax free, above and beyond her $50,400 salary.  Also, since ""conservatives"" like Rep. Vasquez are always holding up the private sector as a model, be sure to ask them to identify one company in Alaska that pays its employees thousands of dollars in excess of expenses. I bet she can't."	0

It is a waste of money to put a hyperloop in Colorado at the moment. It would not get used since you need a car to drive anywhere in Colorado as Fastracks has shown.

California would be another option, but the risk of a earthquake and a lack of public transportation makes it less reasonable for now.	0

"Paul,  Speaking from serving with NATO and being on a NATO staff in Afghanistan and Joint Coalition Staff in Iraq, Trump gets this one right.  NATO takes us for granted and we pay the lions share of its budget.  Bottom line, if a NATO country won't conduct offensive operations in the combat zone they hinder the mission not help.  When we have to remove troops from our HEAVY combat zones to go and help an ally in a ""secure"" zone (and end up staying there) because they won't conduct offensive operations to keep the initiative, they are worthless.  Flying a flag and sitting on a secured base is a hindrance and it causes more problems than its worth.  Do you know what the joke about most NATO nations in Afghanistan was. what does ISAF stand for?  I Saw Americans Fight, not International Security Assistance Force, Afghanistan.  What branch of service did Mitch McConnell serve in?  He didn't let alone go to war."	0

"Of course, you wouldn't want to send a person to someplace where they might gain reasons to not drink. No, instead, we'll just suck them dry financially, physically, and spiritually by sending them to jail and then to a treatment program that teaches them that life has no meaning beyond this moment and that the only thing in life that matters is staying sober.   AA and other spiritually-based 12 Step programs are effective. That's why they're court-ordered. Medical and psychological ""treatment"" programs have huge failure rates -- almost double that of 12 Step programs. Having experience with the treatment programs through working in mental health, I believe its because they don't give the addict anything to replace the drugs with except will-power and cognitive exercises. It promotes hopelessness.   That said, not every program works for every addict. Diversity of choices is a good thing."	0

There is no test to take, there's no person to certify that the dog can do what it's suppose to do.  Which way do you libertarians go on this.

I have experience in proposed land exchanges between the Feds and private land holders.  The thing nobody talks about is the checkerboard land ownership pattern created by subsidizing the construction of railroads, highways,  and military roads to ensure the US Army could easily move men and material by wagon in the rugged West.  There is considerable private land that blocks access to Federal land,  and private land that is routinely trespassed by the public from public land.  Ranchers would like to own a contiguous block and have sovereignty over their tax paying land,  yet the Feds and their Green NGO parallel government entities make the trades almost impossible to execute.  Perhaps the Congress sees this,  and the Greens and agencies won't mention an easier trade solution and are against any Republican ideas by knee jerk opposition and rhetoric.	0

"Well, I'll start with your assumption that any federal money received by Alaska Native groups is a ""handout"" that isn't deserved or worked for. Second, most Alaska Natives I've talked with are concerned about the prejudiced and racist views of Trump and many of his supporters. If he was President, racism and bigotry towards minorities would become an acceptable status quo. No one is afraid of what Trump would do in office- a President has very little power to influence laws compared to Congress- as Trump likely doesn't  really care what happens to the rest of the people in this country. So, your racism is evident in your assumptions about why AFN and many, not all, Alaska Natives support Hillary."	0

"""We need them to fill our churches because the Catholic Church in America has been in danger of becoming an upper middle class club for people with conservative ethics. ""(MSW) This is a salient, yet cynical observation. If one were to attend different churches in the same diocese one would observe different demographics. Some parishes, like mine, are exemplars of Michael's observation. However, nearby parishes show a large number of working class and lower middle class faithful and others with large numbers of immigrants; Latino, and Asian, and others largely African-American and their parishes are equally viable. The Catholic Church is in many respects congregational since individuals tend to gravitate to congregations where the  members have much in common.

McNeil had probably never seen a year where he made more than $40,000 running his small rural business before he got in to politics . That perspective has no doubt driven his policies to curtail public sector wages. Standing O on that one. Its about time the kept ones were allowed to live like the rest of us.	0
Good for you (seriously). However, we have a fundamental difference of opinion. An essential problem for C corporations right now is that these corporations have a fiduciary duty to increase value for shareholders. This has largely been interpreted as a reason to prioritize short term profit taking, even at the expense of long-term goals. Which means that C corps will push to decrease taxes, even if it robs them of their ability to compete internationally with companies that have access to better infrastructure and training of employees. So, yes, profit is good is capital can be used in all sorts of beneficial ways. But, like all things, there is a balance point where the marginal utility of new profit is less valuable than government investments. We apparently disagree on that balance point, which is fine.  I am happy to pay my taxes. But of course I want a general agreement and participation by all. I wouldn't ask you to forgo all government services if you want a smaller government.	0

I have to disagree with your blanket statement that police have never, not one time, ever been disrespectful. There have been a few times where an officer has been disrespectful, maybe 1% or 2% of the time. After all, we are all human beings and not everyone, all the time, is going to be respectful. The senator has been subjected to the 1% that seem to have a problem with being racist. Denying that it does not happen is just denying reality.

The book in question tells of an attack that kills the President and most of Congress, an attack by religious fundamentalist terrorists who  launch a revolution, suspend the United States Constitution, take away women's rights, and establish a sexist, theocratic totalitarian state oppressing the masses with theocratic barbarity.  And for the religion chosen, the creepy, fundamentalist terrorist religion?  The writer of course chose Christianity, thus assuring a large following of fawning leftists and plenty of prizes and awards from their ilk in the ladder of literary politics.

"Russian election meddling As Putin said to one dummy at the International Arctic Forum today - ""read my lips""... ""No"" ------------------------------- Debility of some EU bosses continues: In an extraordinary speech the EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said he would push for Ohio and Texas to split from the rest of America if the Republican president does not change his tune and become more supportive of the EU.   The remarks are diplomatic dynamite at a time when relations between Washington and Brussels are already strained over Europe’s contributions to NATO and the US leader’s open preference for dealing with national governments."	0
Steven Spielberg is well-known for being a stickler for historical fact and detail.  His recounting of Abraham Lincoln's political moves to obtain passage of the 13th Amendment is historically accurate - and can be verified by checking several of the top biographies about him, and those personal notes he made at the time (if you want, I'll post some sources for you although I am certain you can find it all yourself if you haven't already!).  My read was that HRC did, indeed, invite a comparison to the historical Lincoln, even though it is portrayed in a movie.  But then again, so has the Sermon On the Mount.	0

Shallow thinking.  Spoon feeding is not the same as tube feeding or intravenous feeding.  Spoon feeding means that the person is conscious enough to open their mouth and voluntarily swallow food.  Any person whose arms are paralyzed or even just broken would need spoon feeding, i.e. assistance of others in obtaining the food even though they may have no desire to die.  Likely a person whose arms became paralyzed and had signed a no-tube, no-intravenous feeding directive would not expect it to lead to them starving to death.  The story does not provide sufficient information to judge.  In one sense, the woman consents to continued life by accepting and swallowing the food.  A person needing tubes, etc. does not give consent, the tube is forced in and no voluntary action takes place.	0

So if you are unhappy about the user fee just think about having to pay higher property taxes to cover 911 for the users who don't own property.	0
"""Flynn knows the answer and this keeps Trump up at night.""  I disagree. Trump knows he can string along his base ad infinitum no matter what he says or does. He'll eventually fire Mueller and get away with it, just like he gets away with everything else. The Flynn situation will fade into the background as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell continue to allow it to happen. I think Trump sleeps like a baby despite the fact that he's obese, never exercises, doesn't appear to handle stress well, and consumes a diet only a fatty liver would love. He sleeps well because he knows his base will always be with him."	0

"A bit of history. Paul Martin, during an election campaign, publically argued with David Dodge over a Liberal policy of moving down payments to zero when housing prices were rising and young families apparently could not afford a home. Dodge argued it was not good for the economy (risky) nor the home buyer (in over their heads). Now our ruling elite have gone the other way and if successful will wipe 20% off the value of homes across Canada with return to responsibility and higher down payments or ""fake"" interest rate considerations. The constant in this is that our political leaders really don't care much about what their policies do to people as long as they get elected. Try planning for retirement in an environment like this? The outcome will be folks will have to save more to cover the uncertainty coming out of Ottawa. If interest rates rise it will not be due to demand for money from the everyday economy it will be from government spending (think waste). No concerns there?"	0

I agree.  A marketplace for voluntarily contributions to local carbon offset projects is a brilliant win-win strategy.  The most promising contributors will be visitors (nearly 10M per year), who generate huge amounts of CO2 from burning jet fuel (Kerosene) on their long-haul flights. Combining the marketplace with visitor education and opportunities to experience ecotourism and native tourism can further leverage this initiative.	0

The Governor needs to hand this math and investment problem over to the PFD Board of Directors.  Have them develop a bottom line operating budget number the State income and investments can sustain indefinitely.  Calculate the yearly budget number just like the PFD payout; a yearly number averaged over time.  The BOD needs to factor in all State income into the payout equation. Once that number is established send it to the House and Senate to allocate State spending using that bottom line number.  BOTTOM LINE NO MORE!  You would never hand over your retirement account to politicians, why are we considering this with the PFD? In Alaska's case we need a solid investment team to solve this math problem. Fortunately we have one of the best investment teams in the world that spans multiple Governors.  They have a long standing record of winning, then paying out on investments made for Alaska. (The PFD check)  We need to leverage their knowledge and capabilies, in honor of Mike Burns.	0

The formal occupation began in 1912, even though there were various other assaults by the U.S. in Nicaragua throughout this period. American military interventions in Nicaragua were designed to stop any other nation except the United States of America from building a Nicaraguan Canal.""  ""Democracy War""?

From my perspective these 'Neo Nazis' who in reality are 'want a b's' that call or refer to themselves as Nazis are neither German Party Nazis or Americans. Simply these Neo-Nazis are racist thugs. However, there is a bigger picture that now exist in a 'New McCarthyism' perpetuated by leftist in an attempt to justify their own hatred, even racial hatred, and their criminal activities generally associated with their own twist of anarchy. But again, they too are thugs.  The first problem is [as said before] you can't mud-wrestle with a pig[s]. You will end up getting muddy and dirty as the pig likes it far more than you. Which brings me to my second point. Nearly all these letters, opinions on the Charlottesville, matter are at the very least uninformed.

No. The NFL exploits and destroys the bodies and minds of its players, and wastes an entire nation's collective potential with time and energy sacrificed for meaningless sport rather than personal enrichment, recreation, and development. It's a sordid culture that predisposes people to incorrectly approach life as a red-v-blue winner-takes-all proposal. The memes here lead people away from positive collaborative life patterns. It's fine if some more progressive and responsible form of it goes on existing in a free world, but it, especially what it represents historically, should not be celebrated so. It may seem a little over-the-top to call it immoral, but, obviously, it can be reasonable to say that it is just so.	0

It hasn't voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 and has long had a republican congressman, state senator and state assembly member. It lost a lumber mill, the town's only employer.  What dangerous criminals are being let out of prison because the state can't afford to pay the bills?  Name one. Just one.

It's called proper parenting. These items have been made for years. This is nothing new to people of this culture. I fear my children coming into contact with alcohol which is a poison much more than potentially ingesting something that won't hurt them such as an edible. You can't prevent life from happening but at least if a child comes into accidental contact with one they might not feel well but will be in no physical danger what so ever.  I'm 33 and I like brownies and ice cream with Cannabis, I should be able to purchase these products no matter if children exist or not. Children are in more danger walking to school than they are from Cannabis edibles. That's a fact, not an opinion subject to debate. I don't consume alcohol which is a poison and could kill a child by accidental ingestion. Yet I'm not advocating banning the sale of alcohol due to my fears of its potential to kill, which it does to hundreds of people daily, children included.	0

He committed multiple federal crimes and could have been sentenced to something like 10 years or more.  Sentence of one year is a travesty but even that his lawyer will try to get him out of serving prison time.  Guiterrez is one sick bully, brutal killer of endangered birds and a convicted criminal.  In a civilized society he is required to spend at least that one year in prison.  Forget the other two minors as doubt the prosecution needed Guiterrez testimony to convict.

You have never lived in a place or time when it mattered. Most people in the US can't fathom what many other countries have gone through in times of the war, not even close.

I currently work for FAA and will/would greatly benefit financially if they do privatize the ATC services. The plan being pushed by Congress for privatization will give control to the major airlines and NATCA, the ATC union as they will comprise the board that will oversee/control the privatization. I am against privatization as the airlines have no modernized their fleet, have terrible customer service visibility, and care more about cost savings than passenger rights.   I am eligible to retire from the FAA and could return to work the next day doing the exact same job that I do now. I could have my military retirement, my FAA retirement, and a full time job doing what I do now. So financially I'm better off privatizing. It is a mistake! Let your representatives know that we do not want these airlines with more power and control.	0

I think some folks in the chancery don't like that this traditional parish has so much success. It makes run of the mill Novus Ordo parishes look bad. They don't like that cradle Novus Ordo Catholics are finding the Anglican Use. As long as these folks make it to a valid, licit Catholic Mass on Sunday and Holy Days of Obligation, who cares where they go?  If anything this parish is more Catholic than many typical Novus Ordo parishes. I imagine this parish gets a lot of donations too, which factors in to them not wanting it to go into the Ordinariate. I find this happening so soon after Archbishop Flores' death suspicious as well. It's so sad this can happen after Fr. Phillips built that Church out of his family and 10 parishioners.

Compare  what your CPP contributions would have added up to if they were invested over say 30 years at 5% a year   TO   how long it will take to get your OWN MONEY  back from CPP.  Lets say $50,000 in  CPP contributions over 30  years -  that could have easily grown to $150,000  if it was invested at 5% a year -  so how long will it take you to get back $150,000 in CPP payments  after taxes ?  In my case  25 years to get my own money back !!!  OK, so lets make it $120,000 -  that is till 20 years to get my own money back  !!!  Collect the CPP as early as you can so you can get your own money back.	0

The very idea that a moderator, or a committee of moderators, or even a majority of posters can restrict me from posting simply because I don't vote others' posts ""uncivil"" when they think I should runs counter to the purpose of the 1st Amendment Freedom of Speech right, which was put there to protect speech we don't want to hear.

The problem is Keolu is that there needs to be a separage system from the Highway system which is just not working.  The train will give people options.

Democrats are far from perfect but they are the only ones to vote for.  I mean come on republicans.   Are you ever  going to balance the federal budget?  Now that is real stupidity.

Christy Clark remained Premier despite losing her home riding (as has happened to other Premiers and Prime Ministers in the past) and the BC Liberals remained in power.  She subsequently ran in a by-election in which she was elected.  She remained Premier throughout.  In fact she became Premier initially without a seat until she ran in the riding vacated by former BC Liberal leader and Premier Gordon Campbell.  John Turner, who took over from Pierre Trudeau as prime minister in 1984 at a time when he did not have a seat.  He announced he would not run in a by-election, but would wait for the general election.  I used the term referendum in a generic sense.  Many pundits described the 2011 election as referendum on pipelines as that was the signal event in the campaign that completely shifted the momentum and ensured the BC Liberals a majority government.    If you do not agree that the Dix pipeline flip flop constituted a referendum, try at least to respond in a civil manner.	0

2/2 Second: Trump is a career criminal, a racist and a misogynist; he is an adulterer, a prolific sexual predator, a serial sex offender; he’s a liar, a thief and a cheat; he is the most incompetent, corrupt and unstable person ever to win the nomination of a major party.  We know those things in November 2017; but we knew them in November 2016, too. Some voted for Trump because of those things, some in spite of them; but nobody did not already know them. So the question is not, “What have Republicans learned?”, but rather “What are they willing to do about what they know?”	1

Energy east was always the #4 of the proposed four pipelines.   Too expensive and too costly for the oil companies ($16.00 per barrel from Alberta to New Brunswick in a low oil/world oil glut scenario). Put it this way, how many oil companies committed to Energy east? None. How many have signed up to Keystone? None.  Unless the price of oil rises significantly, no matter what pipeline may be proposed, no matter where it is, no matter who is for or against, a simple economics reality will emerge ;  The $$$$ expenditure is just not worth it at this time.	0
Hmm.  Let's see now. The Liberal Party redux.  Image versus content.  Two Parties competing for the same vote, one of them firmly established in governance and the other heading towards the fringe.  Not a hint of fiscal responsibility.  Keep alive the never ending macro issue of Trump.  Make the largess of the state a daily reminder to Canadians.  And remember to employ the folksy charm of the eugenicist Douglas.  Continue to take ownership of Diefenbaker's implementation of national healthcare.  An age of newspeak.	0

It is a sad series of days to be watching the presidential election being manipulated by everything but the issues facing our country.   Wikileaks, tax returns, and common gossip seems to have taken over the election process.  The National Inquirer and the  tabloids most individuals use to scoff at now appears to have more influence than any of the old standards. Voters  are more concerned with the candidates life style  than any of the government  policies they would like to implement or change.  Voters seem more willing to chose a president based on the candidates choice of paper towels that their visions for the country.	0

"As a matter of fact, under the federal system, the Supreme Court has ruled that no federal safety net is guaranteed by law or has to be paid.  They are all ""welfare"" programs, including both Social Security  and Medicare, and Congress can adjust them or eliminate them entirely if necessary.  This is why the ""unfunded liabilities"" (well over $100 Trillion) are not included in the National Debt.  The federal government has no legal obligation to honor promises politicians make.

Except for the inconvenience to the assigned dog, I think they should have let a K-9 unit go in and chew a little bit before using the pepper spray.  Of course, remove the dog first, in the best interests of the dog.   But the police  might have gotten the guy yelling and screaming for a little human intervention if the dog went in first.  People who elude the cops are jerks.  Sometimes it works and they get away.  When we catch the rest we have to inflict a pretty severe level of punishment that starts in the field with the mechanism of the arrest.  This guy got off easy IMHO.	1

I have both an automatic Nissan and a little manual Aveo.  The Nissan works well but the Aveo is much more fun to drive, even though it is a really crappy car in general.  A free revving engine and a 5 speed box in a little car makes you feel like a rally driver when you zip around town. The main problem with manuals is that the clutch is a wear item but it is very expensive to replace in a front drive car, requiring a lot of labour to get at.	0

I am thinking long and hard about whether to end my friendships with people who are supporting Hillary Clinton.  Yes, I know it is a free country (well, it is supposed to be a free country but you wouldn't know it what with the PC takeover of the last decade) and people are free to vote for who they want, but do I really want to associate with anyone who supports such a liberal hate-monger like Hillary? Should I blame them for supporting her hypocrisy (she and Bill cashed in to the tune of $140 million over the past decade by selling public access - read the book Clinton Cash)?  Do I really want to socialize with folks who stood by and allowed the Obama administration to destroy our country by doubling our national debt and causing racial division? Should I blame them for lifting up a candidate who supports a terrorist organization like BLM which is now killing COPs? I am still thinking about it.  Hopefully Trump will win in November and our country will begin to heal.	0

Before pink slips were given this week many buildings lost positions.  This seems to be a misunderstanding among the public.  For the last several years no one has lost their jobs due to attrition.  Many positions were cut - over 100 district-wide - before the 220 pink slips went out.  The 100+plus cut positions were due to budget cuts but were accounted for in attrition.  The 220 teachers and counselors who lost jobs this week were in addition to those 100+ positions that were moved around or cut and just not refilled across the ASD.   We've lost positions for years and just not rehired them.  This is the first year in several in which we've lost teachers in addition to losing positions that will not be refilled.  Also, many administrators were displaced in these cuts.  Many chose to return to the classroom to have any job at all.  So to say that no administrative jobs were cut is inaccurate.  Their jobs were cut, they went back to teaching, and there were still cuts district-wide.	0
The state doesn't have to earn our share of the oil. it belongs to us to begin with.  The industry profited handsomely from their Alaska investments. They agreed to lease our lands and pay us rents, royalties, and production taxes. In exchange we agreed to give them the exclusive right to explore, develop, and produce the oil they discovered.   The industry has tried to cheat Alaska of their fair share over the years and the result has been endless lawsuits and the state winning billions of dollars settlements. The industry has bribed our legislators. Their employees hold seats in the state legislature and have voted on bills that affect thier company--a blatant conflict of interest.	0
Your argument is based entirely on your own anecdotal evidence which means it is very weak as far as any kind of objective proof goes.   I can give plenty of personal anecdotal evidence of non-WASPs being racist towards people of colour.

You know those trillions of dollars spent on war these last 16 years? The very same trillions of dollars some of the hate groups desperately need to create jobs?  Those trillions would buy a great deal of peace. Half a trillion to each of these six hate groups et voila, instant peace.    But you know how valuable a dollar is in Africa. Give boko harum a few billion and a piece of land, throw in a pizza pie and a nice big strawberry short cake, you'll have an ally for life.
