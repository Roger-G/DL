The national police union that enthusiastically endorsed Donald Trump during the presidential election has now warned him that “he could put public safety at risk if he intends to cut federal grants to so-called sanctuary cities.”         So much for being the “law and order” candidate.	0

also POTUS trump there still investigating the Russian collusion in the 2016 election and have nothing yet and never will, you sign it with that in there, theirs no need for the Mueller investigation a very good set up job the congress did on you by lying to the American people saying the Russians helped you win the election.	0
It would certainly be one thing if we were seeing improvement game by game so that we know the program is heading in the right direction.  But Rolo couldn't recruit one local player last year and the team is going from bad to worse.   Our blue chip and second and third tier players are going to programs on the mainland.  Rolo definitely talks a good talk and makes us feel good by saying the politically right things and dressing up for laughs but the bottom line is he is not delivering. Having his former teammates serve as coaches is a recipe for disaster because he probably rather preserve friendships than the program. The only legitimate coach he had on staff was Naeole who reeks of discipline and now he's gone.  Instead of waiting for the inevitable, the AD owes us all an explanation as to why Naeole suddenly departed before the program falls further off the cliff.  There is a stink that is permeating the football program.  We deserve the truth!!!	0

Macron practices Catholicism in his own way. The French hierarchy does not get bogged down by gradations of practice. The head of  the French Bishops Conference said that -- quite explicitly -- after the Ipsos study was taken. The French relish diversity of practice among seasonal, strict, cultural, devotional, etc. Catholics. Their mantra is that you can't measure the whole French Church with one single yardstick (as many Americans are apt to do).	0

The Hillary thing is old, its over with it was investigated as much as it can be . They found her innocent at least three times. There is no there there . You need to stop listening to one sided reports and get all sides and stop being a parrot . if you cannot , that backs my thinking that many Trumpers are mindless simpletons who cannot think for themselves . And, it was Trump who was implicated in the rape of a 13 year old and who hangs with a known pedophile and loves to be peed on. You really need to stop projecting your guilt onto others . Stop crying to mommy that it was Billy who did the crime and your totally innocent . I have to admit from experiences with co workers who like Trump , that like Duck fans , there are some decent ones out there , the rest are all just lazy dumb blights on humanity	1

The comments section is here to speak about the story that one has just read.  It is not a venue for personal attacks of non-elected government officials.  If one has a credible gripe of malfeasance, you go to the appropriate authorities and report your claims.  The only reason to place such comments on this thread is to generate prurient interest - and does nothing to enlighten the readers with regard to the Kealoha scandal.  My experience of Mr. Jones is that of a person who gives exceptional public service, and I believe we are lucky to have him in state government.	0
The woman in workplace thing was indeed a stroke of genius.  I could see that the Liberals were really working hard to get to this point.  That said, it is still too early to say if the Liberals could keep its cool; the whole Liberals government hated Trump.  Even if it would only be 4 years, I am not too sure if the Liberals could put as much hard work and keep the big bully Butts and Wynne out of the picture  in the coming years.	0

JC's still an open issue, above board and subject to public input and accountability.

I agree that Trump is amoral but I'm not so sure he's a moron. More and more, I think he's crazy like a fox with his uncanny political survival instincts and his uncanny ability to appeal at every turn to the lowest common denominator in society and then use it to his political advantage. There's a certain kind of genius at work there that is more demonic than moronic, I think, but maybe that's just me.	1

I moved to Eugene last spring. The 1st thing I learned was don't go downtown, that's where the tweekers hang out. They are always trouble. The 2d thing was that the residents and businesses along 11th street do not matter. As exemplified by the fact that they have announced construction is done till spring, with steel plates being left in place all along the route. Dangerously slick and damaging to tires, these should be removed before ending work for the season.	0

"I remember when the ""The Da Vinci Code"" movie came out, I went to Mass on the campus of the University of Toronto with a son and my wife. The priest said the major question he was asked was whether they were allowed to see the movie. He said that they were but not to treat it as theology.  The movie was panned by the Vatican and people seemed to be attracted to find out why. I enjoyed it as a who-done-it with a Jesus' blood line driving the plot.  It was a fun movie and food for thought and discussion. It wasn't serious theology for me.  I think the days the Church controlled most of the peoples viewing is past."	0
Omar was born in Canada, he is a Canadian period.  Our government failed him by allowing (even participating) him to be tortured by the Americans and now we have to pay the price for that failure.

If one has to again explain to an oil industry-funded denying chorus what a $9 Billion wild fire STILL BURNING in Alberta since May 2016 has to do with climate change, there's almost NO HOPE that they will ever be smart enough to understand.    “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”  - Upton Sinclair  Jane's arguments might be more welcome in more intelligent science-based publications in the future.

And the dog and pony show must go on to please the losers, to pacify them.  WIKILEAKS destroyed her campaign. Mr. Comey broke the law in leaking. Massive unmasking by Ms. Rice and Ms. Powers does look to be a major concern as it looks to have been politically motivated. All the while there are other major Democratic scandals like Ms. Wassermann-Schultz allowing a Pakistani IT guy to have access to several highly sensitive government computers, hers and those of several other Democratic members of congress, including Ms. Clark who lost 120,000 dollars in government computers, hard drives missing or found smashed, and the Pakistani caught fleeing country after wiring massive amounts of money to Pakistan, even though all along the government security had denied him clearance and access to such computers! Sounds a bit like Ms. Clinton's 30 thousand missing Emails!  If they had any felony to charge Mr. Trump with, it would have already come out by now, everything else has and no charges yet	0

"I totally disagree with your perception. There should be no ""reasonable compromise"" at all. The state denies the property owners access, or use,of the natural resources that may lie beneath their property. Under state government control the resources are being given to the oil companies, at no benefit to the residents.Adding insult to injury they then ask the residents to pay ,not only the highest fuel prices possible but,to compensate for the money they gave to the oil companies. It is not difficult to stop all credits, profit from our resources, and promote business ventures by lowering the cost of doing business. The continued single minded approach centered around oil caused this debacle,and is the sole reason for the massive pork barrel spending on corporate projects. The corruption that oil brought to this state permeates our legislature, and appointed offices. Even the pundits are swayed by the corruption that oil places upon the economy.The details are the devil."	0

There are two things I noticed from frequent, albeit informal, examination of the polls and statistical models. First, there was a sudden and dramatic discontinuity in the slope of the statistics and predictions when James Comey announced his (suspiciously timed and still not explained) innuendo about Weiner's emails on Clinton's server, which he retracted. Second, as votes for Gary Johnson decreased, votes for Trump increased; the Libertarian votes seemed to become mostly Republican.	0

Saunders seems to be concerned only with attempts at bombing Parliament - and forgets the murder of  Ian Gow MP at his home in 1990 - while ignoring the many terrorist attacks, mainly by the IRA, from the 1970s onwards. The worst attack was the destruction of  Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, by a bomb probably planted by Iranian, not Libyan, agents. 270 were killed.  Many of the other attacks were directed at Jewish targets. Jewish schools in the UK, as in France, are all heavily guarded because of the threat of attacks from certain religious groups.  The following is a list of attacks on mainland UK, not including NI, from the 1970s.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_Great_Britain	0

Governor Walker and those that voted to allow this to happen or decided not to override Governor Walker's veto are guilty of theft by deception.   They are guilty of  thievery through the use of deceptive and deceitful means with the intent of depriving the owners of the fund their dividend as intended by the establishment of the Permanent Fund. Deception includes creating a false impression of present fact and promising to provide services of which there is no intent to provide.  The ultimate irony of this thievery is that they are not strangers who broke in and stole the people's money.  They claimed to be friends, good representatives who would work to protect the best interests of all the people,  not their own interests or their special interest groups.  Governor Walker claims he has the authority to do this.  He says he needs to raid the earnings to save the PF.  He says the Government needs it more then the people do.

Problem is, Trump wants a significant portion of the revenue from Keystone XL, which means that would require an even stepper discount then we already wind up with then sending oil to the states.  And once we start sending, NAFTA prevents us from reducing the shipments, so we have no bragging power, so we are much better of getting the oil to tidewater and world markets.	0

"J Hamstra,  You basically parroted the approach of the article. I posted the partial validity of it. Are you acquainted with the Kohlberg model? You post about ""rare occasions"". In life  and at church it is less rare. At a place of work the motivations are pay and being fired. SDA are worldly, insubordinate rebels. Why do you think preachers keep presenting sermons urging bible study and proper Sabbath observance..etc. Sermons are basically chew out sessions and inept shallow religious therapy sessions.. Also think of where Jesus said to the disciples, I no longer call you servants but friends. He is alluding to internal motivation. The SDA denomination needs a wake up call & reality check. Members will continue to be Laodicean lukewarm losers as long as pastors & leaders are satisfied with ""playing church."""	1

This article and its writer represents the exact line of thinking that is leading to the populist movements currently propagating across the Western world.

You make a big assumption about what the wealthy think. Does Bill Gates think this?  What about Warren Buffet?  What about the Susan and Michael Dell Foundation?    So, are you wanting a fairer distribution or are you wanting re-distribution.  Many would argue the current system is fair - your work and talent get you rewarded.  Most honest, decent, and good folks don't won't a handout.  Most people I know want to work within their skills and abilities.  We should absolutely help people succeed and continue down a path that maximizes their talents, skills, and willingness.    I know one person who had a MA.  She didn't really want to work, but had to work about 2-3 days a week to afford her rent and food; and to afford her time off so she could play her guitar.  But she always complained about the high prices in YVR.    Help those who need help, yes. Re-distribute for the sake of re-distribution, no.  No honest, hard working person would want that.	0

That is assuming the factors driving the development of ISIS, as well as Al-Qaeda, even PLO and the many other militant groups around the world will  dissipate when ISIS is destroyed. That strikes me as highly unlikely- ISIS after all is only a symptom, albeit an extreme one, of a deeper malaise that drives and motivates many seeking to escape the tyranny of powerful masters and the pervasive abuses they use to support inequity in so many parts of the world. In a very real sense, that large majority of Americans devoutly seeking economic equality that you mention have the same goal- but nobody talks about that. Hopefully our systems of democracy can disenfranchise some of the prerogatives of power, however to this point,  the powerful appear to be doubling down even in the US to maintain and tighten their stranglehold on advantage and opportunity. This is driving people to adopt ever more extreme tactics, including electing Trump. In fact, it ain't over yet by a long shot I'd say.	0
Maggy: the Liberals are not my party; I did not vote for it.  About this issue, I'd call Harper bloody-minded, not idealistic.

Hey, all politicians do that to some extent, and he was good at it.  But I draw the line at litigation by opinion poll, which he did over and over.	0

Fair enough, but has anybody noticed that the 3 coffins at the funeral shown today on TV news are draped with non-Canadian flags, only the flags of the nations the ""Canadians"" came from?  Wonder if Trudeau who is attending the funerals will eulogize the sorrow of Canadians sans Canadian coffin flags?!! (Of course, trashing Trump is fair game!)"	0
"There is more to it than that.  They are going to tax work in progress, try to define ""passive investment"" v. proper financial planning,  take away investment flexibility that protects against the artificial nature of the year end, prevent retirement savings for small business owners etc. etc.  It is not simply the logical issue you identify.  If it is income on amounts over the small business rate, they are getting their money anyway.  They are attacking the small business like farming, plumbing, landscaping etc.  They already get the big guys.  In a way they are essentially taking away the small business tax rate for any small business that turns a profit in any given year that does not immediately reinvest in some form a consumptive capital."	0

I’m happy to see this ruling, and wish both Canada and the US would have the cojones to go after Google.  Their practices are deceptive, and they have been caught lying one too many times to ever fully gain my trust.

Further, the requirement to stay signed in to Google to use the Android operating system is a blatant invasion of privacy.  High time they were taken down a peg or two.	0

When your commander in fancy socks exalts that all are welcome implying no ifs, ands or buts in light of the proper legal channels, it is impossible for anyone to be prepared for any surge in asylum seekers. The people of Emerson were blind-sided much like what the people of Quebec are experiencing now, by their idealist, federal government. Only after public outcry does the commander react and need to assure Canadians that the immigration system is working and can be trusted. If you have to say this, it means that it isn't working and you've lost the trust of the people who are counting on you. And BTW, our Immigration Minister is a rookie and is likely learning very quickly what it's like to do the commander's dirty work. After all, our commander would rather be at parades, celebrity events, Hip concerts and in New York City with Ivanka. God bless this nation.	0

I agree that women should use common sense and not put themselves into those situations.  In this case, I would have to see more evidence the young man was really drunk, since he was aware enough to know he was discovered, and able to run away.  His actions (and the fact he had enough experience with alcohol to know how it affects the body) seem to indicate that he really just expected to get away with it because the girl would not remember.	0
Apologies for not being clear. I didn't mean to argue Trumps message, and clearly he had one whether you agreed with it or not,  .  My point was only that his election to the office WAS the message.	0

"Um, no, the supporters of Hillary were the majority of Americans who voted for her. The popular vote, remember that? And hey, the media isn't a single entity. Fox loves Trump.  Every time Trump makes a fool of himself, you can't simply murmur ""the media lie, the media lie"" to make the problem go away. Trump only got in because of a protest vote by many people wanting a change, any change. With the weak candidate (Clinton) gone now, the Dems will find someone good, win that protest vote back, and Trump will lose the next election as badly as McCain did against Obama.

No matter where she works I am sure there are many males that hit on her because of her good looks.  And I am sure she knows MANY males.  Her problem is that over the years her REPUTATION........DEFINES her and any Smart male now stays away.   This probably explains why she Hangs with the SEX OFFENDER.

Well said, Peggy.  The swamp is merely being presided over by another Yertle.  Feathering the corporate nests of his pals and increasing military spending are nothing if not concentrations of algae and mucilaginous goo.  I think Ibbitson is correct in saying that the blaring headlines are distracting us from his agenda.  The more we chuckle about the Bowling Green massacre and some of the more egregious tweets, the less focused we are on some of the more frightening aspects of his policy.  Is  Trump/Bannon being crazy like a fox?  Unlikely, really, since while underhanded dealings figure prominently in Trump’s past, discretion certainly does not.  I think it speaks more to the desire of both the media and its consumers to jump on soundbites and foot-in-mouth disease rather than delve deeply into policy issues.  But it’s kinda working for the dynamic duo………	0

"""I don't get why THEY don't get it.""  If we could answer this question, we might be farther ahead. My sense it that it's a combination of a number of factors  - an unwillingness to see women as human essence. Far better to view them as a separate species with unique ""talents"" curiously not aligned with what is normally considered intelligent, analytical, inventive, decisive, passionate. . . you know, the traits that Actually Move the World Forward.   - no/little experience working with women as colleagues. The idea terrifies most of them.   - an investment in their own theology of gender which says females were created for males. Why believe the help?   - no motivation to change. It's been a good gig thus far.   My experience is that when ""men get it,"" they become fierce allies and articulate spokesmen about sexism (as many men here demonstrate daily).   But you need a reason to ""get it."" What theirs?"	0

"Everything an employee does is not part of their personnel record. It must be actually be personal. The courts have ruled over and over again that just calling something a personnel record doesn't make it so.

Municipality of Anchorage and Anchorage Daily News, 973 P.2d 1132, 1135 (Alaska 1999), the Court made clear that simply because documents or information may appear in, or be placed in, an employee's personnel file, does not mean they are exempt as ""personnel records.""

Basically, the SSM ruling is a non-ruling.  It is impossible for two justices to participate and officiate in a same sex marriage ceremony, then go into chambers and rule for what they just participated in.  It can't get more conflict than that.  Without those two conflicts, SSM would not have passed.  Also, Justice Kennedy cited 40,000 children in SSM, without comparing it to the hundreds of thousands of children in common law marriages, and in the same boat as homosexuals.  The 14th Amendment cannot be used for equality because it cannot compare  apples with oranges.  People married to people not married.  Male and female to male and male.  SSM is a form of discrimination, where only one gender can enter and bar the other.  SSM is there for unconstitutional.  Our Constitution CANNOT recognize an orientation, it is an	0

These are wealthy South Africans shipping their money out of South Africa, never to return. He says that in 2020 there will not be a tax base in this country. The Finance ministry knows this of course, explaining the latest laughable attempt to get income earned offshore by South Africans taxed in SA.

If I understand the purpose correctly, the banks are effectively paying investors so that the banks can put additional capital on their balance sheet to satisfy minimum capital reserve requirements (ie more cash on hand in the event of a crisis, which measures were heralded in post-financial crisis). This would mean that they can't spend this cash, although it should free up other cash reserves. The only novelty here is that the banks' advisors have found a way around the twenty five percent foreign tax, drastically increasing the yield for investors and therefore making these investments incredibly attractive.	0
Agree with you nalogirl. What the people who are trying to destroy records of all the “bad people” in American history are doing reminds me of what the Chinese Red Guards did when they destroyed countless irreplaceable records of China’s 5000 history. <p>  Destroying American history (e.g. statues of Confederates, etc) is exactly the reason why some of the marchers in the Charlottesvill march were protesting; they were not Neo-Nazis or White Supremist or sympathetic to their causes. And neither was President Trump for those Neo-Nazis or White Supremists as Mr. De Busca implies. </p>.   <p>In fact the “very fine people” President Trump was referring to were people like the teacher and her husband who were interviewed on TV. They said they were there to oppose the destruction of the statues, which are integral parts of American history. These were the “very fine people” President Trump referred to; not the Neo-Natzis or White Supremists who he has disavowed many times. </p>	0

I've done plenty of research.  You aren't including the issue of divorce.  Married men who are happily married are, indeed, the happiest.  Married men who get divorced, on the other hand, are among the most miserable, and the most likely to commit suicide.  As men, we see what happens when a man gets divorced.  Better to be stable and single than divorced, economically devastated and suicidal.  Considering the stats on the chances of divorce, there's a reason that there's a growing movement for men to abandon marriage in all but extraordinary circumstances because of this risk.	0

"It isn't a ""narrow"" decision at all, because it establishes that wearing a veil is a legitimate religious right to practitioners, and that it must be balanced against one of the most important rights in the whole legal system, the right to a fair trial.  That is a far, far tougher bar for any veil-related religious claim than this ban, which does not involve individual rights balancing at all, and is instead about religious discrimination by the state against one religious subset.  You keep bringing up that Belgian decision, but continental European law on matters like this of a completely different legal tradition and far less concerned with the rights of the individual than Commonwealth legal traditions have been.

Suppressors have been used for years in Scandinavia to keep the sound of gunshots from disturbing one's neighbors excessively.   My old Norwegian roommate once told me that it was considered rude to hunt without one.  That being said, I wish we could have had free access to them here years ago.

A woman can be sitting just across the table from me, I can see her lips move and hear her voice, and yet I have no idea what she's saying.  I only understand her speech in quiet rooms.  When the subject of suppressors comes up, I always compare them to the use of mufflers on an 18 wheeler.  Imagine how loud it would be without one!  That's the sound of unsuppressed gunfire.  With a muffler, while it's still loud, it is at least tolerable.	0

Example if someone asked me if I like what the President has done so far to build the Wall or stop illegal immigration I would rate it negative.  This author would take that to mean I don't like what the President has done.  FAR from it.  I'd rate it negative because the WALL isn't built yet and we haven't stopped more illegal immigrants (never satisfied!).

I like President Trumps characteristic of not adhering to a straight Republican platform.

What does it matter where people die, Oregon, Nevada, California, from some lunatic bent on mass murder. Sure, it may bring it closer to home, but how much closer than Roseburg do you need to get? As to blood on the hands of gun owners, hoooooey. None of my guns killed anyone today. The same can be said for the owner of all the other 300 million guns (minus about 20). Finally, I'm not angry. I'm sad; sad that 59 (so far) attending the concert died and hundreds more were injured. This is not a ""gun violence"" problem. This is a violence problem. If these sorts of incidents are to be prevented, we need to find out what turns people violent. The tool they use is not the issue. That's true especially in the case of guns that protect people from violence possibly millions of times each year in this country."	0

"Remember all the local pols who patted themselves on the back for landing the ""XYZ"" call center and all the good jobs it would provide.  Call centers have minimal investment costs in where they locate and, at least in Lane County, manage to get local government to pay for the lions share of it with tax concessions.  In the end, they move to wherever the next low cost place is.  While Oregon certainly hasn't made it any easier for these mobile jobs (i.e. mandatory sick leave, huge jump in minimum wages looming), the fact is these are not companies that develop local ties and local roots.  More like economic tumbleweeds.  More of the political effort and public capital (tax breaks) need to be focused on companies that show they have some skin in the game with their own investments."	0

Charles Barkley once said he figured out the difference between being rich (as he was) and being wealthy like Miami Heat owner Mickey Arson when Arson'a yacht broke down at dockside and he ordered his back up yacht to come over. Barkley also wrote in his book, the real legacy of slavery is the lack of wealth in black families. We are just starting to see the first few black children who are born into wealth, such as Michael Jordan's children, or if Oprah had children. But the whites have a several generations head start, made all the worse by the fact that their wealth, at least from the South, was realized by stealing the labor of the blacks.	1

There exists no switch inside the human body which magically imbues increased responsibility merely because the person attained 18 years of age.   Under the law as written it is appropriate to charge the two students as adults. However, it may be prudent to change the law to allow for 18-year-olds to be charged in juvenile court if they were a high school student at the time of the offense. If the law were so changed, the same exceptions would be available which would allow the DA to remove a case from juvenile court to adult court if the facts warranted a removal.   In Oregon, the juvenile court can keep jurisdiction over a minor through age 24 with a focus on reducing recidivism and education with the resources available to make a significant change in a person's life. Whereas in adult court the individual likely will be little more than warehoused and labeled with less access to rehabilitative services and education.	0

The editors seem to be delusional when they propose that, ""What is needed is Democrats and Republicans sitting down in good faith and hammering out some compromises.""  What we are dealing with here with the Republican Party is an organization that clearly prioritizes the free flow of killing machines over slowing the killing of people.  The bodies keep piling up and they don't give a rat's behind because what's most important to the Republican Party is to keep in place the sick and disgusting system which permits on-demand killing machines and ,massive profits for the gun industry."	0

Dunsmuir and Schneider write: “The Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 per cent, from 1.8 per cent earlier this year, and has run below the central bank’s 2 per cent target for more than five years.” This is false. The US Fed targets the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI). It was at 2.2% in February, but has since dropped to 1.7% in April. Except for February 2017 it has only exceeded its two percent target from January to April 2012, i.e. in the month the US Fed officially adopted an inflation target rate with the PCEPI as its indicator. Dunsmuir and Schneider are referencing the PCEPI excluding food and energy (PCEPILFE), a core PCEPI measure, and the preferred one of the US Fed, although they also follow a trimmed mean core measure quite closely. It did fall from an inflation rate of 1.8% in January and February to 1.5% in April and has never been at or above the two percent target from January 2012 forward.	0
No Richard, no report showed that.  I was at the assembly meeting where the overtime issue was discussed by the Fire Chief and what was written in the press was a complete misrepresentation of what was said.  I'm retired now but the vacation system has not changed.  Each rank only allows 1, 2, or 3 people to be on scheduled leave at one time depending on how many positions exist at that rank.  Each employee is offered two cycles (weeks) of scheduled leave and the number of people allowed off is limited by that policy.  When you are operating a department at bare minimum staffing (as they are) then it will obviously incur overtime.  Overtime is expensive but you are saving money the rest of the year by not having the increased staffing to cover those periods when people are on leave.	0

Before any new taxes are created, cut the budget further across the board except for what is necessary to protect people from other people. That is the fundamental purpose of government. Families & businesses cut their budgets to fit their income. The state should be no different. There can be no compromise with an income tax. Once you start it up again, it just gets worse. An income tax means the fruits of your labor do not belong to you. The government decides what you keep & collects it through coercion, intimidation & threats. That is why Alan Keys called it “the slave tax”. It is a tax for a collectivist society not a society founded upon the principals of individual liberty & freedom. Marx & Engels supported the income tax as the 2nd tenant of their “Communist Manifesto”. Our Founding Fathers, champions of freedom & individual liberty, did not believe in a direct tax on individuals. They supported tariffs, which is a consumption tax. A sales tax is a consumption tax.	0

When I visited Germany in the 1970s, things were fairly peaceful and one didn't see police all over the place.  Millions of Muslims have now swarmed into Europe and European countries have given them asylum. But there have been numerous incidents where followers of Islam have attacked, maimed and killed innocent, civilian non believers in France, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, etc.  Consequently, European countries have had to increase security. Police are everywhere and it's almost as if people in Europe are living in police states with police on every corner.  And in New York, U.S.A., the police have increased security and in Toronto, Canada police have increased security just in case followers of Islam try to attack Christmas shoppers.

Schembri delivered his speech when the latest CPI-common inflation rate was 1.4% for December, barely up from 1.3% in November. This November 2016 rate was the lowest recorded for this hapless measure since May 1996, and much lower than any other measure of core inflation. Also, he claims that it is just a mystery to the Bank, which heavily promoted the common component of CPI measure prior to the 2016 renewal agreement, why it is so low. Two things that he might consider are that the common component measure is strongly weighted towards the mortgage interest cost index (-0.5% inflation rate in November) and very weakly weighted towards the purchase of passenger vehicles (3.0%). It is hard to think of any combination of attributes that would more completely disqualify an index as a measure of underlying inflation.	0

This man is like a five-year-old who's found his dad's loaded gun under the bed. Tragedy is inevitable. I wish it weren't that way and I hope I'm wrong, but I truly believe Trump will bring disaster to this nation and the world.	1

It's the breakdown of the family structure among poorer whites in North America or Europe, that can lead to declining educational standards (kids from broken homes in Scandinavia do better). Immigrant families in North America and Europe tend to stay intact.  As for radicalized kids, the Pakistani kids (who make up a large chunk of the British Muslim kids) were from a backward part of Pakistan, where education was less regarded. That has translated to a lack of success in the next generation.	0

Dave, to call the OIA selfish, petty and spiteful is way out of line.  Here is what needs to be said about OIA versus ILH competition: IT'S NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.  The big ILH programs can cherry-pick talent from across the state with no restrictions and can afford better facilities, better equipment, and more and better coaches.  The OIA's sole advantage is that it has far more teams, which increases the probability that in any given year it can field one or two teams capable of competing head-to-head with the ILH's elite.  Under those circumstances it should be no surprise at all that the OIA is opposed to any playoff format that could force its champion to beat two top ILH teams to win a state title.  Knocking off the ILH's best is already asking a lot given the ILH's intrinsic advantages.  I agree with you that it's unfortunate that the end result has been to decrease the overall size of the playoffs and a better compromise is needed.  But don't trash the OIA as the culprit.	0

The measure of a society – a just society – is not whether we stand up for peoples’ rights when it is easy or popular to do so, but whether we recognize rights when it is difficult, when it is unpopular,” Mr. Trudeau said. “We are a society that stands up for peoples’ rights and when governments fail to respect peoples’ rights, we all end up paying and that is the lesson hopefully future governments will draw from this settlement.”  IF this happened in business someone or someone's would be paying the price with their job.

In the 1950s, the truly voluptuous Cadillac Eldorados were the 1957 and 1958 models, which now sell for a fortune.  No contemporary equivalents.

In the 1970s, a 1974 Firebird Esprit - really???  Surely, the 1970-73 Trans Am, or perhaps the 1971-73 'boattail' Buick Riviera.  (Seeing a pattern here?)

The State of Oregon screwed up IT for the Department of Administrative Services, for the Department of Employment,  for Cover Oregon, and for DMV (twice).  The reason all of those were screwed up is because no one 'in-house' was capable enough to define what IT was required and then get that information into the contracts that were developed.  They all signed 'time and materials' contracts with no mandatory deliverables in those contracts.  The same thing happened for the City of Portland a few years ago.  Government does not and cannot hire the same quality of IT folks as Microsoft or Oracle or lots of other organizations.

"Sugar, of course is only a small part of the equation.  Those who sell ""junk foods"" would certainly not agree to raise prices and all corporations would be up in arms against any attempt at price control.    Taxation of this industry to compensate for the harms they cause and the resulting costs to government which are underwritten by the taxpayers might be used to subsidize the cost of healthy food for those who cannot afford them; perhaps through a voucher system.  It is a complicated matter that needs attention. You can ensure that if nutritionists are left to decide what is healthy and what is not industry lobbyists will be all over Health Canada to keep the standards sufficiently broad so that these companies are minimally affected.  Hospitals and schools are no place to be selling junk food and this should be banned immediately.  Exercise and education are certainly a useful part of the equation but the poor often lack access to the latter."	0

I really don't think that is very accurate, Trump didn't have much support at all from major U.S. businesses.  Other than from Trump himself, most of the big-money/big-business dollars in the U.S. election went to Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz.

"If you have a problem with the USA using a MOAB in the mountains against the enemy claiming some moral issue with killing an enemy that has less weight in ordnance than we do you're sadly misguided.

Good for Trump allowing his military commanders to fight the enemy with every tools we have. He probably saved some of our military people from death and permanent disabilities by not having to go in on foot and try and root them out of their well fortified caves.

It's counter-intuitive but the value of the currency is backed by taxation.  Requiring tax liabilities be paid in Canadian dollars is sufficient to give the currency value.

"“But we are looking at what we can do to allow her to return to Zimbabwe without being charged,” a South African official said.” We don’t want to jeopardise relations with Zimbabwe. Also a First Lady has never been arrested in Africa and the rest of the continent is watching us and we have to be aware of what it could do to our relations with the continent.”   So, now all the first ladies from the rest of the continent will come here and sh*t on our laws and fellow citizens expecting no consequences because our government ""officials"" don't believe such esteemed persons should be subjected to the same laws that ordinary local mortals are subjected to. This saga is making a mockery of our country and laws, and our government is not only allowing it. How many times have Mugabe shown SA the middle finger and shoved the ""sovereignty"" of Zimbabwe in our face whenever we comment about the burden South Africa has had to bear because of the chaos he is causing in his country?"	0

The main health issue I see with marijuana is making sure it's free of pesticides, a protection we've never had buying it on the black market.   If you eat too much of it you will get sick. It's very unpleasant to be stoned and throwing up. People will learn that the same way we all learned to drink -- by going past our limit and being sorry. Edibles should be clearly marked for amount of THC and people need to follow directions.   We need a public health campaign to teach people not to drive stoned -- just as we all learned in the past from public pressure not to drive drunk. The problem is that state legislatures don't want to spend money on public health campaigns. They worked in California to reduce smoking, our most destructive drug, but it has been a long time since I've seen an anti-tobacco billboard in Oregon.	0

You CANNOT approach cops while holding a weapon. Here's a true story of when I was last confronted by cops: I am pretty much the only minority living in my neighborhood, so I automatically stand out. Last summer I was walking down to the bus stop about a mile away, I was on my way to a Rox game. The building I was walking behind was apparently broken into a few minutes before I got there. As I was walking around a corner, I saw 2 cops with their guns drawn. At the time I was digging through my pockets for a cigarette lighter, & when I looked up & saw them with their weapons out, I stopped walking towards them & pulled my hands from my pockets.  I didn't put my hands above my head, but I did put them out & away from my body so they could easily see that I was of no threat to them. They saw that, asked me what I was doing there & where I was coming from, then they explained what was happening & let me go. If I continued walking towards them with hands in pocket, I could have been shot.	0

And yet, this is not ever where the finger should be pointed.  Once again, the media and people in general are focusing on the wrong issue.

Roy,  I guess you have attacked Mr. Hanson, because his message does not fit your personal agenda.  Fair enough.  But, Stanford University is FAR from a bastion of Liberal Thought.  And, you have presented absolutely NOTHING to support your claims against Mr. Hanson.  This was an excellent article, that debates the merits of hate-crime legislation.  I believe he presents a very valid position.  Laws already exist to protect individuals from murder, kidnapping, rape, etc...  Does it really matter what motivates the perpetrator who commits these violent crimes?  I believe they should all be punished severely - regardless of the underlying reasons.  Hate Crime Definition encourages division, and brings unneeded attention to these cases.  Make it go away.	0

Are your first couple of paragraphs steeped in sarcasm, or are you serious?  If the latter, you need to read a bit about Asian gangs in many cities in California. While not as numerous or populated as other ethnic gangs in our state, they certainly are NOT absent and certainly DO account for serious crime.

This speaks to profound failure in current immigration policy. In the past, a young man who migrated would have been so busy building a new life they would not have time for drugs and terrorism. Today, we have many young men who are either abusing or dealing drugs in the countries they have migrated to (despite receiving welfare and settlement funds), and who have developed such a hatred for the country they have gone to, they want to harm the citizens of that country. In the UK, such men have murdered dozens within weeks of each other.	0

"SCM said; ""...with special privileges for the French and the Christians...""  After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Québec. Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange. And Paf ! Problems started across French Canada ever since !"	0

And I fully support your right to further the idiocy of associating the mass standing and singing of a song with patriotism.

Who is it that funds and staffs the pregnancy resource centers, where women in crisis pregnancies can find for FREE whatever help they need (housing, financial, job search, counseling, clothing, furniture, medical, etc.) not only until they give birth, but for several years afterward if needed? There are twice as many of those in the US as there are Planned Parenthood facilities, and they get not a single penny of taxpayer money, nor do they ever charge for their services. Further, studies show that pro-lifers give more money, and more volunteer hours, than pro-aborts in the US. And no, I don't have citations for the dozens of studies I've seen over the last 30 years.

I am interested in the GRE option at death. Does taking this option provide 3 years during which capital gains can be declared, rather than declaring them all at once on the date of death?

I still think we should ban career criminals by sending them to the Lower 48. Maybe a 3-judge panel could be set up to determine this. Once banned - automatic, long-term jail sentences would be mandatory for anyone who was banned upon returning to Alaska.

The problem is not that foreigners will sue US officials in US courts. The problem is that other countries will pass their own laws allowing their own citizens to sue US officials in their own courts based on their own interpretation of terrorism. Do you really want US political, military and intelligence officials and operators sued in Pakistani, Syrian, Iraqi, Venuezualean courts? And when we lose these cases do you want US assets in these countries siezed by foreign court order? Ironically, the Senate's action may very well subject the United States, in some Islamic countries, to judgements made under sharia law.	0

"Ward 1:  I'm neither condemning nor defending Mr. Craig's parents.  I don't know enough about the situation to do either.  I agree that the very easy accessibility to firearms in our country often presents problems.  However, we have over 300 million firearms in private ownership and such ownership is Constitutionally protected.  We need to find ways to keep firearms out of the hands of those who would ""misuse"" them while not infringing on the rights of those who own firearms and don't misuse them.  Obviously, that's not easy and ""gun control"" is one of the many very contentious issues we face today.  I don't think there are any easy answers.   BTW: I was, and remain, an outspoken supporter of Oregon's expanded background check law.  I think it, if actually followed by private sellers, could be helpful while not limiting purchases or ownership by ""lawful"" gun owners.  I'd be interested in reading other suggestions you might make regarding these issues.  Regards, Gary"	0

"I have been up to Fairbanks four times. The first time was in the summer and I was very unimpressed by it. The next time was in the winter and I was even less impressed. I think my words were something like ""how could anyone want to live in such a ugly place"". Now I admit that both times I was only there for a few days on business therefore my impressions came from the area where the meetings were held and from the view (none) from the hotel.  Years later I had to go back for a meeting but this time one of the Fairbank people invited al of us to his home for a cook out. I was shocked to discover that there were some real trees and other greenery there. It was a beautiful setting! The last time I was there it was wintertime and while we were being held ""hostage"" during our lunch hour, we had a view from the top floor of the courthouse of the frozen river with a dog sled race going on.

2 Corinthians 13: 7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. 8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.  Are we allowed to no longer wish for those that reject Perfection?  Can we stop praying that they do no evil?  Everyone has the right and choice to serve satan.  Do they then have the right of represent in and to justify evil?  Do they have the right of represent of good?  Arrogance is the attempt to represent in absence, whether in knowledge, resources or intent.  Does it not sound like entitlement?  To demand privilege of HIM from taste, without seeking the perfection of HIM in taste (Hebrews 6)?  Sounds awfully luke warm, entitled and demanding to me.  I don't think I could justify something like that in my humble opinion.	0
Canadians should be thankful for the Alberta glut.  Robyn Allen, a Canadian economist, and former CEO of ICBC, has produced a peer reviewed report that states that when the Alberta glut is broken, Canadians will pay 50 cents per litre more for gasoline.

What a fool.  Can't even post a link.  Keep your tinfoil hat on.  FYI, that mortgage was funded by capital that was accumulated from millions.  Every day depositors, people saving for their retirement, those in retirement living off the interest income.    Possibly millions made your mortgage possible.  By renting that money, you benefited from the financial system that accumulated that and made it available for you to borrow for whatever time frame you did, instead of having to ask your closest 300 friends for it.  And that credit card you don't keep a balance on, every time you buy something you are using the financial system.  And when you pay it off after borrowing that money, too for a short period, because you certainly don't pay the bank that issued it the same day you used the credit card, you are also using the financial system.  If you don't think it is useful, I suggest you take your gold coins, hop on a plane to Amazon.com, pay for your purchase and then come back with it.	1

"This is a public safety issue, not an ideological battle over helping poor people, but it is also a concern about public funds being used to provide $400,000 ""low-income"" housing units which are not built to current codes and energy efficiency. If it falls, as it appears likely, we can only hope no one is injured or killed, and that the public won't be on the hook for the ensuing lawsuits, but we all know the bureaucrats responsible won't pay the cost of this disaster waiting to happen. They should at least lose their jobs for this supremely bad judgment.  For $400,000 per housing unit a LOT nicer homes with separate lots could have been built, albeit perhaps not in downtown PT. What a waste, even if they don't end up a pile of rubble to be hauled to landfill.

"Good grief! Gawker is one of the reasons we have Trump in the White House. Gawker, far from being the free press, was a free for all press.

Nothing.  The very idea that ""Gawker was motivated by wit, it was artful, it was about good writing. It was about surfacing the truth, it was about being honest about how power works"" is ludicrous and disproved by the following sentence: ""Donald Trump is in every conceivable respect a foul and vile inverse of that idea. I mean, he’s literally throwing his own feces at people.""   Yes, witty good writing where the authors don't know the meaning of the word ""literally"".

Shawn, The taxes I'm referring to are the taxes we and our kids will have to pay to cover the huge unfunded government pension liability hanging over the state for the State Retirement system. If a teacher for instance does not want the sorry unequal representation that the union offers they will still be forced to have the large union contributions taken from their pay anyway. A teacher has no right to work if they don't pay the teachers union. The union does not treat members the same as some members have lovely golden parachute pensions and some members have no pension at all. So all members are definitely not represented as one. Generally union members pay taxes with money coming from tax payers. Mystrom was one of our worst leaders because he decided to split the conservative vote by running for Mayor and brought us the worst in our city's history Begich. But I agree he should not have swept city retirement liability over to the state. Local control is much better.	0

"The Cold War was supposed to be over in 1990, but it wasn't; the U.S. has continued it ""by other means."" Russia, as in the first Cold War, is reacting defensively against what it sees as U.S. determination to eliminate or subdue an ideological, military and economic competitor on the world stage. It's as primitive and irrational as that.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the U.S and NATO countries had a golden opportunity to bring Russia into a larger alliance, but old rivalries and mindsets prevailed in Washington, and they left a chaotic post-Soviet Russia to its oligarchs and criminals, while encircling the country militarily.  It's not too late to reverse the insane pursuit of dominating Russia (it will never permit it) and to seek common ground. Hopefully Canada can play a constructive part in bringing that about."	0

The article should have made a clear distinction that this was either a motor scooter, or an electric mobility scooter used by the disabled.   A motor scooter cannot ride on the sidewalk, period.

I'm not saying that gives anyone the right to brandish a weapon in any situation other than self-defense, but you can't impede disabled people on mobility scooters either.

I like Schatz for putting us on a new trajectory for Hawaiian sovergnty with the Dept of the Interior handling the legal status.   OHA and many activists had given up hope for Congressional action on the Akaka Bill and the unique position native Hawaiians had under the bill.   Unfortunately we could never get the political strength to pass the bill because of Republican opposition but more meaningfully, the lack of support by many Hawaiian activists. The recent Constitutional Convention non-meeting or even alternative meeting is a good example of the lack of OHA leadership.	0

"""Those of us concerned about climate change generally inhabit an old-fashioned reality-based world.""  I just loved this opening sentence.  While no climate change denier I'm aware that population growth over my lifetime - 2.2 billion to 7.1 billion remains at the center of the problem in my understanding of ""reality"". Every report I have read on fossil fuel consumption suggests that consumption continues to climb and will continue to climb until the technical sciences have reached the point where alternatives are 'reality based'.  If glaciers are going the way of carrier pigeons and oceans are going to rise significantly - why not do what the Dutch have done; invest in 'reality based' infrastructure.  This will deal with some of the foreseeable downside of climate change while creating jobs and boosting economic activity around the world.  And taking another leaf from the Dutch planning book - do this work over a period of decades and centuries.  Just a thought!"	0

"AM, Well said.  But remember that photosynthesis was created by God.  I would suggest we look at ""what else"" we are doing that negatively impacts the earth:  poor water management, poor farming techniques, deforestation, unnecessary consumption, excessive waste, etc.  As an engineer, I look to what can be corrected in the shorter term.  I look at the negative effects of energy poverty.  Affects of CO2 are minimal and are not linear, they diminish with each incremental increase (a curve).  Water vapor is the greatest greenhouse gas and one that we cannot change.  Would God create an environmental so fragile that by using the gifts He gave us we could destroy His creation?"	0
I like that helicopter idea, a lot.  I was going to suggest a pink pony for each Scarborough resident. The magic sort of pink pony that can fly you anywhere you want faster than your eyes can twinkle with delight.  But then of course somebody will have to clean up after all of those magic pink ponies. This could be especially problematic when the ponies are airborne. And then of course all of the people in Scarborough would all need special helmets to protect them from being hit on the head by falling magical flying pink pony poop.  Your helicopter idea would probably be way easier to implement.	0

Humans exhibit various behaviours that, while advantageous earlier in our evolutionary history, are no longer desirable, e.g. the fight-or-flight reflex that gives so many people high blood pressure in fast-paced office environments.   In this case, it appears reasonable to assume that groups with strong self-identification and a hierarchy of males often express and reinforce their structure via regular demonstrations of sexual dominance and submission, which is often symbolic, e.g. Weinstein masturbating in front of junior females, and not necessarily heterosexual, e.g. homosexual dominance in the Nazi SS.    The value in this observation is that once a group falls into this behaviour pattern, all members participate and reinforce the pattern and accept it as necessary or inevitable, even if they don't like it.  Once we recognize that groups often exhibit this pattern, we can look for ways to jam the behaviour and morph it to a more appropriate group dynamic.	0
"I think Scheyer oversimplified her point by saying ""I’m not comfortable being led by a man with this hair..."" She does add ""or his frequent childish and sociopathic behaviors."" Her larger issue is the effort by Trump to style his hair which, in her opinion, is ""supposed to inspire confidence.""  Of modern presidents, I'd say Trump's focus on his hair stands out. Sure, nothing about looking good. But Trump seems to want to hide his balding and I assume, his real hair color. That the pompadour (correction: Mullet) is a relic of the 80's signifies Trump's, um, roots.  Her claim is that the hiding of his bald spot, fake color and old-style pompadour are symbolic, representing an insecure personality which he displays through narcissistic behaviors.  It is not just the hair. It is how Trump's personality is displayed on the top of his head for all to see."	0

Who would waste their time watching the Oscars, I quit when it started to get political.

Whazzie: listen to Budsie if you truly love the game and your team. There were a great deal of good things that came out of last night's game for your boys. Good tending , some good playmaking, better shooting and wonderful  forechecking from Marner, Komo and Kadri. The D-men where inconsistent, but my guess is that Gardiner is trying foolishly to pick up where Panie and  Kadri left off instead of emulating  the more junior Rielly.  That kind of foolishness doesn't work in this league, unless you are Bobby Orr and that ain't gonna happen. any time soon.  Mathews is who he is, he ain't Crosby, McDavid or a real great player.

Most of the lawyers and judges in Hawaii do not follow the laws or their own rules. How about a drug dealer forging docs to steal someone's paid off mortgage, and the victims are forced to go to a (drug court?) to get their title back, and have the judge falsely claim they have no standing and deny them a trial, and give their property to the drug dealers. What happened to the 14th amendment! That's exactly what Judge Ronald Ibarra and his subordinate Judge Melvin Fujino on the Big Island in the 3rd circuit court do. Try to Appeal it and the appeals court just covers up for the crime of the lower courts, so there is no justice!   Like Kealoha, Ibarra is banking on getting away with a retirement pension this July, instead of prison time!   All this mailbox and speeding tickets stuff is nothing compared to the real crimes going on, in Hawaii. Move along...Nothing to see here folks!	0

America is the wealthiest nation on the planet yet massive income disparity. A relative small number of families literally control more wealth and income than MILLIONS of people in the US. This undermines that whole opportunity thing bigtime. Dollars spent by low and middle income earners fuel the economy. Wealth hoarded by the upper %'s do not. If your libertarian agenda does not address this than you should start over. That aint freedom. Productive my patootie.

You are clearly very knowledgeable on the topic and I can respect that.  The ""Fix"" is what should have been done in the first place with is a loss in power and MPG therefore it will be interesting to see the feedback from these customers.  When the largest auto manufacture in the world is not capable of making a clean diesel, it doesn't bode well for its  future.  I only suggested 10 years but yes, you're right it could take 15 or 20 but the point was it will slowly fade away.  Light truck sales are strong but a very and I mean very small percentage are diesel and an alternate technology with a strong amount of torque is on the horizon.   I wish diesel could remain as a viable alternative to gas and electric as I truly do respect its power delivery and MPG but I'm not optimistic this will happen."	0

"It appears no one has to sabotage Trump.

He watched a Fox News bit on how Sweden allowed refugees into their country, then interpreted that to mean there was a ""terrorist attack last night.""  In this case, he probably saw a B-movie on cable TV, then imagined the Muslim ex-POTUS from Kenya was out to get him.  Imagine if Donald watches a movie about cigarettes being smuggled into the US from a foreign country. That could naturally be interpreted in his mind that North Korea just deployed nuclear missiles at the White House.

"ronto1: I believe you're correct in some aspects but I also think those who rent condo units need protection. Harris' crew gutted Ontario's rent control laws in the 1990s on the premise that the changes would spur rental housing construction. The succeeding two decades have demonstrated that the approach has failed. Further, most of the new rental housing that has been built is for high income tenants. Many renters are relegated to the condo rental merry-go-round and even previously affordable pre-1992 rental buildings, like the one in which I live, have inexorably been transformed into high-rent housing by means of other loopholes including the ""above-guideline increase"" scheme and the unlimited ability of landlords to increase rents when units are turned over to new tenants. The government needs to take a look at the entire rental housing industry with a view to addressing both supply and affordability. No effective rental housing policy can view either in isolation."	0

"The media tends to indulge in cultivating a cult of personality around political figures to---yes---make a lot of money from election cycles.  The greatest money-maker for them is a close race, and it's fairly easy to steer public opinion by shining the spotlight on the warts and outrageous things a candidate might say to pander to certain audiences.  Our system thrives on partisan differences---It drove this election, and it'll drive the post-election transition.  It's far easier to manipulate a nominally ""free"" electorate when they're busy fighting each other, rather than demanding accountability from their government.  It's past time to snap out of it and learn to work together across artificial boundaries to do just that.  It's time to listen to each other, and you may as well start at home; whatever Don's warts, the Constitution has not been suspended (yet)---It's the kind of document that thrives from adversity.

I don't say this to be mean, I don't say it to be hateful, but the transgendered population suffers from a delusion: they believe themselves to be the opposite sex. They're not. They can never be. There is no amount of surgery, or hormone treatments that can make a person switch teams. All it can do is mutilate a person, and develop secondary gender characteristics.  This is not side-effect-free.  The last numbers I saw put the US suicide rate at about 4%. The transgender suicide rate was pushing 45%, and surgery didn't make much of a dent in that. That's abnormal. That's a problem. Black slaves in the US  didn't commit suicide like that. The only other group that did on that level were Jews in Nazi Germany.  You don't tell a schizophrenic that God really is telling them to do things. You shouldn't tell these poor people they've switched sides. These people need professional mental help.	0

Robert Paxton's definition is well-known:  <<[fascism is] a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.>>  Kind of wordy to fit on a baseball cap, though."	0

"Francis is a Jesuit, and thus ""almost by definition"" neither ""intellectually loose and sloppy"" nor ""too clever by half.""   I recently heard a story from the recent Jesuit General Congregation, the gathering in which they elect a new general and lay out guidelines for their future efforts. Francis was invited and came. He was asked for concrete guidance, but he pointedly refused that request. Subsequently the gathering fell into some heavy intellectual disputation, before settling down to a process of ""group discernment of Spirits,"" code from the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius for letting the Spirit become their source for the concrete guidance Francis as pope had refused to give his fellow Jesuits.   Francis is steadfastly refusing to shout from the roof tops the bits of tradition that traditionalists want him to emphasize like JP2 and B16 so they can use those papal shouts to put down progressive voices.  Francis message is the same as to the Jesuits...hear the Spirit for yourselves."	0

There  is so much wrong with this, it's hard to list it all. Let's start with the Mayor's comments. “It would really damage the city’s reputation with quality developers to in the last minute change course,” Cooke said. “My concern was we would have a repeat of Pine Tree Park (when the council backed out of a sale to a developer). But that came from public pressure to change course. In this case there was no public pressure but two council members who want no additional apartments in Kent.” Well, OK. Really? The Pine Tree project was halted because you folks were caught doing something ILLEGAL! No public pressure? You need to get out and talk to people who live on the West Hill or are they too blue collar for you?  The city's reputation? Don't make me laugh.

Clinton supporters must seriously consider electability and just how weak of a candidate she is.  Besides Trump, Clinton has the highest unfavorable ratings amongst any of this years candidates or any in recent history.  Whether you agree or not, she is seen as dishonest and inauthentic by a massive swath of the electorate...not just Republicans either.  And she does terribly with independents and crossover voters.  She is THE establishment candidate in an anti-establishment year.     Sanders on the other hand has great favorable ratings and is seen as honest and authentic.  He does very well with independents and crossover voters and does better than Clinton in head to head matchups against every Republican candidate.  Clinton supporters like to say that Sanders isn't electable but there simply is no evidence to support their claim.

First there was the 5-year push by Parnell to reduce the State's share of oil profits provided by ACES.  BigOil execs flew in private jets to threaten the State with possible pipe line shutdown if new oil does not come to the surface, but there were no quid-pro-quos to assure that what Ak gave up was worthwhile. The next election was purchased. Proposition One was defeated by massive spending by BigOil. Common Sense was abandoned. Secret meetings, delayed audits, reduced transparency ... all continue, to the delight of BigOil & the detriment of Alaskan residents. Legalized larceny prevails. Unless & until we Alaskans draft strict ETHICS RULES for the legislature, & pass by Initiative,  we can count on seeing a steady draining of the Permanent Fund - & the PFD - into the coffers of BigOil.

Ant perspective on his death is long gone, and like many artists he will probably be greater in death then in life. He and the Hip were not international stars, his singing voice wouldn't make it on any one of those reality shows, and in fact he and the band have more of a cult following then a large Canadian following. Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Michael Buble, Gordon Lightfoot Paiul Anka and Neil Young have far superior voices and a greater following, okay maybe scratch Neil Young, but they haven't died with an inoperable brain tumour.

You’d think that if Trump were as rich as he claims to be that he could pay his own legal bills. President Donald Trump’s attorneys in the probe of Russian election interference are being funded in part through a Republican Party account with a handful of wealthy donors—including a billionaire investor, a property developer seeking U.S. government visas and a Ukrainian-born American who has made billions of dollars doing business with Russian oligarchs. ☭ The Republican National Committee, through an account typically used for its own legal bills, paid more than $300,000 last month to help cover Mr. Trump’s private legal fees, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The fund has also paid another nearly $200,000 to lawyers for the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. If you donated to the Republican Party, ...you're footing the bill for traitors. Winning.	0

First, it's bizarre to make the claim that feminism in the 60s and 70s wasn't about choice.  The whole point was that a woman should be able to be a brain surgeon or a heavy equipment operator if she wanted and that the barriers such choices should be removed, as they largely have been.  Feminism never fought for the right of women to raise children because there was no need to.  As for parental leave, the issue is whether extending a woman's parental leave is good public policy.  The obvious alternative is splitting family leave allowance between both parents so that men can also feel free to take time off work to care for their infant children, as is done in Quebec.  Or perhaps it would be a better use of the money to increase the amount of pay parents receive while on leave -- a lot of people cannot afford to take a lot of time off at half pay, so extending leave without increasing the amount paid will only benefit those who can afford to take the pay cut..	0

Ah the stupidity of all. The oil industry invested massive $ in the 2003 to 2013 period . Investment $ all based on crude oil pricing being $100 plus. As a result we have had increased oil production volumes coming on stream as it takes 10 to 15 years for oil ang gas projects to have their incremental production volumes realized. 99% of that new oil production has come on stream.  Oil pricing is dictated by the futures market which operates on a nano-second basis instead of a 10 to 15 year time frame. Stupid for oil companies to invest any $ at all to even sustain current production given that the banking empire cartel has the power to set prices at whim. Not the type of business any of us should be in... The only group that could operate under this whimsical price fixing is government. And we all know the disaster therein. The banking empire will ultimately force all commodity businesses to be government owned as long as it insists on price fixing at going out of business prices.	1

"So there is another hockey team in Ontario. Stuff happens. Congrads to the New Centurions. Good luck and enjoy the games. Sport? Bear down and. eschew the sundance. Sell more shoes! Buy a t-shirt and move to Rochester and cheer for the Bisons! The NHL belongs to the Maple Leafs. Barf! Pinot by the barrel. Strap the barrel to Ida and Heidi-Hoe and ride the GO Train to oblivion. I coached the Senators in 1917. Newsy Lalonde and Dit Clapper rode the bus with me to the New York Herald-American. The blizzard of Ought-8 was a doozy but the presses rolled. My boss was grateful and bought me a season pass to the New York Rovers. Basil Rathbone would walk his Great Danes near my office and ask me to clean up after his hounds. It was my pleasure. Sport! Nurnie and Saullie still haunt me to this day. It was a dark and stormy night! Fishslap! Barf!  Phantom Joe Malone put me on ""MUTE"" . I always thought it was Scottie but it was the Fighting Sioux all along!  I was never in Halifax during The War."	0
If the stupidity of states awarding winner take all electoral votes stopped then one person one vote would matter more than ever. My honest opinion is that this contributes a great deal to the nonvoting masses that don't see a point to voting it a heavily red/blue state.

Well, the Springfield Police Dept should be criticized for their handling of this matter.   The man said that he wanted to commit suicide by cop, and they obliged him.

"Annie, certainly you make very good points.   However, my point was that illegal immigration must be stopped, certainly not ALL immigration.  If you want to argue that the immigration laws and requirements are too strict and/or difficult to conform to, and need to be reformed, then I would readily and totally agree.  But the claim that desperate people need or deserve to be allowed to ""jump the line"" if you will, is problematic.  Does a person without a job, living in poverty, and who is hungry, have the moral right to steal food from a grocery store or a private home?  Do we have the moral obligation to leave our doors unlocked in case someone needs to take food from our homes while we are out?    A sovereign nation has the right under international law and Church teaching to control its own borders.  A nation that closes its borders to all immigrants would be within their legal rights, but in violation of Catholic teaching; a nation that insists immigrants follow procedures is not."	0
Now there's a great idea! Fundamentally, they're no different than say a crack dealer cutting his garbage with rat poison, or some deadly pharmaceutical...   The main difference here is that the crack dealer would go to jail where as they would just start a new company, new name and source new license...  No  jail because they have the money and they're essentially, 'authorized criminals' with no regard to human life - solely interested in their monetary, bottom line.  Dispensaries don't do this; yet, they get unfairly busted for helping what LP's cannot help with...	0
I did not mean debt.   Yes, if you have nothing you are not facing much of a burden.    If you have something you will facing losing it.  That may seem reasonable as to children but what about the surviving spouse?   In Hawaii with multigenerational living, a catastrophic illness depending on length may result in the loss of the family home.  Yes, there are ways to minimize the loss by divesting one's assets in advance of an illness but that takes expert assistance.    Still, a lifetime or several lifetimes of savings can be rapidly and substantially dimished by a fatal illness.  That is a burden that weighs on the sick and the family.  http://www.elderlawanswers.com/key-medicaid-information-for-hawaii-for-2017-12174  http://longtermcare.gov/medicare-medicaid-more/medicaid/medicaid-estate-recovery/	0

Dryenema, I am being sarcastic.

Some people born to wealth and privilege recognize they climbed out onto 3rd base, Morneau is not one of those people.	0

The government didn't listen to Canadians already, they are doing things to benefit companies and not Canadians. Wake up, people need to take action and picket in-front of their MPs offices and reject all policies that encourage or pander to immigration labor or foreign labor, we need to be doing the exact opposite! Decreasing employer access to immigration labor, internal mobility program worker labor and temporary foreign worker labor, so that the job vacancy rate stays above 3.5%, that's the way Canadians will get good jobs. That will decrease unemployment, underemployment and household-debts. The government is obviously not doing anything to addressing these things that's very clear! That's why people have to get out in public and picket in front of MP offices now this week, organize groups online, start a new political labor party, don't just comment online!	0

Another G&M episode of sexist ( whatever )  .... The plot is getting rather stale and moldy by now.  I spent many years in high tech industry ( R&D ) and management. The annual ( professional ) staff performance and salary reviews  were agreed between the relevant management groups given the budget and noteworthy performance criteria. We did have a percentage of female scientific staff to PhD level. At no time was there any discrimination against the ladies of our division - and I categorically reject the credibility of the minister's anecdotal histrionics !  Engaged in extensive industry contacts related to busines and again a percentage of women professionals - they were treated with respect, period ! To do otherwise would have been unthinkable in my experience.  It is in the nature of the beast that women tend to decline the more intensive career paths for family reasons .... and I for one think it is entirely unfair to them to expect otherwise. Feminist propaganda to the contrary !	0

"“Denver has been discovered, but we should (feel) lucky,” said Nicolais, who lives in Denver. “A lot of cities are cheap to live in, but it’s cheap to live in because no one wants to live there.”  Stupid remark. By flocking here all your doing is fueling local political egos and making out-of-state developers rich beyond belief. You need to ask yourself why no one wants to live in these ""cheap"" cities the author speaks about. The answer is they are really more expensive than Denver to live in because of the quagmire of social costs strangling their local economies. Denver is evolving the same way with its current political crony capitalist management. At some point in time, the market will correct here and real estate sales will go begging."	0
"Walter: Well, there are many, many books on this subject. Another one: Rodney Stark's recent ""For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-Hunts, and the End of Slavery,"" by Princeton U Press.  Another: Charles Murray's ""Human Achievement."" With those above, that's 4. As well as copious Internet research. Of course, it's not just ""knowledge,"" but what one does with it. The ancient Greeks in the end were ""stillborn"" on science. It just ended. As did Islamic science. Whereas science since the Catholic Middle Ages has been a going concern because Catholics developed scientific method. It's religion, specifically the Catholic Religion, that gave people a reason and a way of thinking that made science a going concern. In particular, as all these scholars pointed out, St. Thomas Aquinas solved the problem of faith vs. reason by showing there was no conflict, and where conflict seemed to exit, it really was limited human knowledge that needed to be advanced."	0

"2/2 Trump could have fired Comey on Day 1, or within the first month. If the reason for termination was the mishandling of the Clinton investigation, that's what he would have done. However, Trump had already made it clear that he appreciated Comey's help in defeating Clinton.  <Better late than never.> Once Comey announced that there was an ongoing investigation of Trump's campaign, it was too late for Trump to fire him. He might have gotten away with it if he had simultaneously announced the nomination of a career law enforcement officer with impeccable credentials and no known political affiliations. The investigations continue. If you are a former prosecutor, you recognize that Trump is displaying the classic behaviors associated with a ""consciousness of guilt."" In the Comey matter, he went beyond that: he told Lester Holt that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation, undercutting Pence, Spicer, Sanders, and Conway all of whom were vigorously lying for him a day earlier."	0

Mr. Forman has his timeline wrong. Maybe he is confused because Obama did not just suddenly announce the policy change out of nowhere like his successor tends to do. Instead, he started the process in 2015 and went to great lengths to get Pentagon feedback on issues and implementation.  . In the first few years of his Presidency, Obama was a little busy dealing with the effects of the Great Recession and Economic Collapse and thousands of our soldiers dead and wounded in the wars in the Middle East. Despite that, he worked with Congress to eliminate the legal underpinning of DADT in 2010, then worked with the Services to create a smooth transition when he eliminated its last vestiges. In 2011, he also started the process of expanding the combat roles available to women, culminating in opening roles across the board. . These are not the actions of the moral coward Forman portrays, but rather the responsible actions of a man making significant, lasting changes.	0

Paul, while I like your point  of view, I must disagree with you some about Maslow's hierarchy. That goes way back to the early 1940s and we've learned a lot since then.  We no longer believe one has to fulfill one level of the pyramid  before moving up to the next. Of course it's based on common sense-- it's hard to think great thoughts while your stomach is growling or your feet are cold-- However, now we realize that some of the most profound people have lived lives of limited comfort, while some of the most advantaged were thoughtless boors. (A certain current example comes to mind.)   I'd say this so-called hierarchy  was part of the ideology that helped the Esalen  crowd of beautiful rich Californians believe they were closer to God than anyone else.  The elites traditionally have claimed moral superiority as the Chosen ones. Personally, I've found some of the most kind and thoughtful people in places like  poor villages in Greece and Mexico.	0

"From the article: ""raising questions about whether the decision to go into the red when times were good was foolish in retrospect"" =============  One does not need to wait to ""retrospect"" on this one, it is a BAD idea regardless of what economic philosophy one follows.  It is extremely rare that you can get all economists to agree on one thing, but if you were to say ""Is it a good idea to run big deficits to stimulus an economy when you are at the peak of an economic cycle"" you would get a nearly unanimous ""NO!"".  Even Keynes, who's name is used to justify deficit spending, was STRONGLY opposed to deficit spending during periods of economic strength.  His main contribution to economic thought was the notion of ""counter-cyclical spending"", ie government should spend during economic downturns and cut back during periods of economic strength."	0

"Why not face up to the fact that the world doesn't need that dilbit, doesn't want that dilbit, and  -- there's plenty of cleaner, far less environmentally damaging (and cheaper) sources for any petroleum they still need -- will eventually boycott that dilbit. The Tar Sands are already history.  Today's new-model buggy-whip makers, coach-makers and wheelwrights can scream till they're blue about the changing world, and nasty politicians who decline to invest heavily in technologies that are rapidly becoming inherently untenable -- but neither economic sustainability nor environmental sustainability give a damn.  Smart coach-makers learned to make automobiles, and prospered. The ones who didn't adapt... they're not around anymore.  ""Conservatives"" like Kenney are trying to navigate the road to future prosperity with their gaze fixed on the rear-view mirror -- and getting hysterically upset that the rest of us don't want to steer according to their directions.  And there's a cliff ahead."	1

"Come on... :-)... pigs flying in heaven and/or snowballs frozen in hell are neither necessary nor sufficient for women to be priests and bishops...  Going back to our current dialogue, this is a more reasonable scenario:    St JP2 will get together with us and explain what were his *real* intentions in publishing Ordinatio Sacerdotalis.  Then he will smile and say, ""isn't it awesome  how a Pope can write an irrational *executive order* for ""the glory of God and the good of souls""?  And what about the silly *fake news* published afterwards by the CDF in response to people's incredulity?  Wasn't that an amazing exercise in creating ecclesiastical confusion?  Ah, but even though holy people can make mistakes, the Spirit persists until reason and sanity prevail, for the real glory of God and the real good of souls!""

While I don't believe that Comey was fired for any of the reasons you mentioned, you might want to give your own theory a reality check.  Firing Comey changes nothing about the FBI's investigation. That's because the FBI's activities are under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department, not the president. (He just appoints or fires the FBI director.) The FBI also reports to the National Intelligence Committee, not the president.  Additionally, there are a good number of other security agencies involved, such as the CIA, NSA, HS and so forth. They too report to the National Intelligence Committee.  It would require a mass conspiracy on the part of all the US security agencies to suppress the truth in this case. And I don't think any president has that kind of political power, let alone Trump. Firing Comey will make no difference to the outcome of the investigation. Aside from that, Comey deserved to be fired for his meddling in the US presidential election.	0

I don't know why Rob picked American dividend stocks to write about unless it was to establish a point with available data.  Particularly American bank stocks which were heavily penalized after 2009.  They had to keep a rising Government controlled asset supply to guard against future problems and dividend raises were restricted.  Because of that the dividends for Bank of America and Citi were hardly worth talking about.  At least that is what our analysts keep saying.  Pres. Trump has talked about cutting bank regulations, so in future those stocks and their dividends may be more meaningful.	0
""" ""Perhaps Mr. Sorensen would enlighten us as where someone who wishes to work full time might go to obtain a full time job in the current economy.""  The question is not relevant. ""Mr Sorensen"" is not running for office nor promising anything in the political arena. So, again, you may want to ask the current President this question who promised everybody a better USA under his administration.  As soon as he got in, they went behind closed doors and formulated some phony ""Obama Care"" agenda that has been bankrupting the USA ever since. And they forced this agenda on the people without proper authority in harmony with the will of the people.  So you better ask the right person about a steady job and why people can't find one. And why the health care system is down the toilet by elitists who place themselves above the law?  And I am not the one who turned this forum into a political agenda to oppose Trump and support Clinton. Did you do that?"	0

"I don't doubt that this ""new"" interpretation is mainstream; it's just not Catholic.    Today's scholars are no smarter or more enlightened than those who interpreted the scriptures hundreds of years ago; indeed, the farther we go in time, the more disconnected the scholars are from what the intentions of the Gospel writers may have been.    To suggest that these interpretations are new is just silly; symbolism and spiritualism are nothing new.  These interpretations were surely considered and rejected by scholars long ago, and nothing has changed to warrant revisiting the Church's long-held teaching on these matters.   New is not always better or more correct, but that's a common misunderstanding of progressives.  They think that they're so much smarter than everyone else and everyone who came before them."	0

The statements can both be true. Von Rumerstein says it started in an ordinary conversation between Burke and  Boeslager that led to Burke asking him to resign. Boeslager refused, which upset Burke. It is possible that Festing then asked for the resignation, citing a disruption of the Order's relations with the Vatican.  There may be other ways that the accounts can be reconciled, but this seems like the most obvious. Cdl Burke's denial may be a denial that he officially asked for B's resignation, because his request was more informal. It was only when Festing entered the discussion that it became an official request that B resign.	0

"Um, you should actually read the case, buddy.  1. The law is actually known as the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, or CADA, if you want to abrieviate it.  I have no clue what DORA means.  The only abbriavation that DORA even comes up with is ""Defense of the Realm Act"" which was an British Act defending itself in World War I.  If you're talking about the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), then that doesn't apply to the acts of Colorado, since it was declared Unconstitutional by the Supreme Court as it applied to the States.  2.

The problem with recent data (even 2014) is that it is not necessarily yet reliable. And there can be variations in GDP estimates depending on source.   Here is a 2015 OECD release. They use 2013 data. https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Country-Note-NETHERLANDS-OECD-Health-Statistics-2015.pdf  While there are signs of the wild growth slowing (where they moved from the middle of the OECD rich country pack to near the top), much of the decrease is related to changes to their pharmacare. More important, the taper in growth could just as likely rationing that many countries go through - then followed by expansion.	0

I am really thinking Trump has early dementia.  He constantly lunges from one thing to the next, back and forth, up and down.  There seems to be almost no organization to his thoughts and statements.  Remember that film of the experiment with a room full of hundreds of ping pong balls, each one on a mouse trap.  One ping pong ball is let loose and all the rest just go crazy in all directions.  That's Trump.	1
"Lack of respect for our fellow citizens is manifest in this country.  The awful carping by self-styled ""liberals"" against Trump and the GOP reaches new depths every day.

Nothing is said here about what the reporter said or did, but it should be part of the discussion.  There are limits to what media folks can do and be held harmless.

I THINK that T is going for the full package.  And to be honest, based on reagan's garbage, I would very much like to see a TOTAL package.  The wall is a waste of time and money, but a possible compromise might be to put aside money to build it for 10 years. If at that time, we have more than 1M illegals (should be zero, but not possible), then we build the wall. Otherwise, use the money against the debt.   And yes, both parties MUST put substantial items on the table. DACA really is not. Both major parties do not want DACAs sent home since they are the true victims in this and are ideal for keeping here.  I will say that I think that we need to tighten the definition of a DACA. Basically, it needs to be at least a GED/better, OR at least 3 years in school and still in it. For that, they should get green card. If they drop out, bye bye. If they do honorable military or vista service, then citizenship.	0

"I wish that CAHOOTS was available 24 hours a day, especially for a city the size of Eugene. But the Eugene Police really also need to have access to their own 24-hour on-call mental health crisis counselor who can provide assistance in these matters. And the Eugene Police also obviously need better training in situational de-escalation. Based on the description given in the above report, I also wonder why an EMT wasn't dispatched to the scene? And why the police didn't ask or find out whether the teen, who was experiencing a psychotic episode, was taking any prescription medication and have the EMTs provide appropriate medical assistance if necessary then transport him and his mother to have him evaluated by a psychiatrist? None of these police officers acted appropriately. They clearly misread and did not understand the situation, in my opinion. The performance of all the officers at the scene should be reported as ""unsatisfactory""."	0
"For certain conservatives, it always boils down to ""But, Hillary!"" IIRC, when President Obama came into office, numerous Democrats wanted George W Bush and his top associates investigated for war crimes. Obama turned them down flat. I'll say this much for your idea: If President Trump gets desperate enough and orders Attorney General Sessions to prosecute Hillary Clinton, every Trump supporter would stand up and salute, and a Republican Congress would have a hard time finding the legislators to continue investigating Russian attempts to interfere with the election. People would be so distracted, the Republicans could pass anything they wanted to. But it smacks of despotism, of banana republic dictators. And, think about this: If a Democrat wins the 2020 presidential election, and ordered President Trump be investigated for obstruction of justice, graft, violating the emoluments clause, etc., Trump supporters wouldn't have a leg to stand on. All their howling would be so much hot air."	0

"The ""bases"" were all false in all of those I believe. That was the flaw then and it still is now in BS21.   When SB21 passed it included a ""base"" tax of 4% if I recall.  It`s intent was to provide a minimum return to the sovereign under ANY prices scenario. That`s how the ""tax base"" was sold to the public..it was ""impenetrable"". That was the pitch to us citizens when SB21 was being crafted with the help of folks like Hawker and Chenault and Giessel. We soon found it was not the ""impenetrable"" base they said it was.   That`s just one of the serious flaws. The definition of ""new oil"" that includes Pt. Thomson, is absurd, being as we had to take leases back, argue for a DECADE, and sue Exxon to get Exxon to perform on it`s Pt. Thomson lease as it states in our laws.  That field should be considered ""old"" oil under the new tax determinations.  Then there are the ever-growing NEVER ENDIND deductible loss carry forwards... but you know the drill Stevo, you`ve been shilling for them for years"	0

"Classic. Been there, done that. When wheels come off the plan (here increased expenses, lack of disclosure to decision makers), many parameters vary. Financial performance envelope becomes unclear (yes, an envelope. Much like a playing field. But it defines the borders of the field). Decision makers cannot sift through issues without seeing the consequences. Poor deal management is of course at the heart of the issue, but finger pointing gets nowhere. If anyone in the fearless leader group is reading this, it's time to get project working group (not leaders) directly involved with decision makers to hammer out critical parameters and get direct results from assumption runs. Not recommended for extraction and abstracts to senior decision levels because prior communication proven unreliable. Intense analysis for weeks, like living in a submarine and coming up for air once a day. Of course, this may expose project leadership.

"You're welcome, Jim, but all the details are part of the public record. We've all heard of government partnerships that accept outside funding, such as Public Private Partnerships practised at every level of Canadian government. Canada's Dept of Fisheries & Oceans (DFO) wanted to develop the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area for marine research to ensure sustainable economic activities re: fisheries, tourism and development. The Moore Foundation had helped to fund a similar project in American coastal waters.  Initially, Canada's Conservative government viewed the Moore Foundation's funding of this joint research venture between Tides and DFO as transparent funding and accepted the responsibility for federal oversight. At the same time, Enbridge was extolling the billions of dollars pouring into the 'oil' (bitumen) sands from Asian investors, reporting ""opportunities abound as foreign companies transition from investors to owners."" Foreign funds in Canada can be traced."	0
Without revealing too much personal history, I will say that both were raised in Hawaii.  Long history and very knowledgeable as well as competent officers.

How is it that you can write an article about the Massey Bridge boondoggle without even mentioning transit? The big question is if the province will invest in transit, which reduces climate pollution and provides lasting congestion relief (to the people who ride transit at least), or wastes money and worsens the climate crisis by widening urban freeways. Translink is testing doubledecker buses running through the tunnel, and the bus lanes are almost complete to the Canada Line; time for a lot more buses. (There are some very nice doubledecker highway coaches available now). Maybe there is even a case to be made for rail transit on this route?

Illogical but effective editorial  There is no argument that those REPORTING say $250,000 income pay enough tax. They do. The changes are meant to deal with people making in substance $250,000 or whatever primarily or almost entirely from their LABOUR (perhaps as a doctor) but spreading that income among family members who do not really contribute at all to generating the income or deferring the income by leaving it in the corporation. A $250,000 earner who is able to spread the income to other family members or avoid having to claim it is the issue. The editorial is an example of arguing by misdirection and distraction.  The editorial however seems effective, the misdirection and distraction worked (on most people)	0

"rosenlee states "" our keiki can't wait any longer""  is that a JOKE? they been waiting for the past 50 yrs to get teachers to teach instead of taking off every week and leave the KEIKI's to be babysat by substitutes who basically take roll and sit back and read the paper or fut around on their cellphones.   Rosenlee and the hsta are the reason we have incompetent and lazy unionize teachers who know they don't have to do much to keep their job.  stop using our keiki for the teachers benefits. right now i believe the teachers and all the other union workers at the school, district, state level are benefitting and the keiki's are losing.  NO RAISE!! till they start to teach every minute everyday. cut out the union and we will see only the good teachers remain and then we can give  those teachers a well deserved raise."	0
If that is your belief system then yes.  But I have not heard 1 report of anybody denying service for who the clients were, but for what the clients wanted the person to do nor were the clients treated with disrespect.   The clients were simply told there was a service that would not be performed.    If I am a doctor, should I be required to perform 'death with dignity' if I do not believe in it or execute a prisoner that has been sentenced to death, or perform an abortion?  Right now, we do not require doctors to perform these services if they do not believe in them.  Why do we require bakers and others to go against their belief systems and not doctors?	0

“Trump intends to dissolve charitable foundation to avoid conflicts” -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now there’s an oxymoron. “Trump” and “charity” in the same sentence.

Trump’s mantra appears to be, “Charity begins (and ends) at home.”	0

It is shocking that most of the Republicans are still sitting on the sidelines on this one, more concerned about their own political careers then the security and well being of the USA. But eventually even they will join the growing majority of Trump doubters and realize he has to go - if for no other reason then to save themselves from defeat at the polls in two years.  If the safety and security of the country and its people is the primary purpose of Government, then how can a man who believes Putins propaganda, Fake News and conspiracy theories rather than facts and the overwhelming evidence of Russian hacking presented to him by the entire US Intelligence Community - be the leader of our country? Trump is completely nuts and will be impeached or forced to resign sooner rather than later.	0

Mr. Cotten's commentary showcases the continued, habitual ignorance of state wildlife management.  This is the thrashing tail of a dying beast.  There is an inexorable trajectory away from the use of predator control in wildlife management across the nation, as it is unethical, inhumane, ineffective, costly, and destabilizes ecosystems.  Yet the State of Alaska continues to stay stuck in this 19th century management ideology, pretending it is based on science. It isn't. We expected better from the Walker administration on wildlife, but so far, they have been just as bad as the previous Parnell, Palin, and Murkowski administrations.  Many are extremely disappointed in Governor Walker.	0
If the discussions result in tribal consent that appropriate environmental controls are in place, as referenced above, that would be a good outcome.

Then the local natives will see that they have just been a shill in a national anti fossil fuel movement that could care less about them.	0

No need to condescend to me pal, I know it just fine. You seem to be making a case that entirely ignores the ESTABLISHMENT clause of 1A in order to make your point valid. It isn't as vapid as the simply declaring official religions, there's way more nuance to this (or any) amendment. SCOTUS has ruled that a law is not unconstitutional if:  a) it has a primarily secular purpose; (b) its principal effect neither aids nor inhibits religion; and (c) government and religion are not excessively entangled.  Well reasoned men and women on either side of the debate  can argue whether any of these were true or false. I would argue that b and c are  happening in this case. If you care to debate why you don't think a policy Trump himself describes as a Muslim ban isn't a violation of either a, b, or c, then I'm all ears. If you want to condescend and pretend yours is the only valid opinion on the matter then I guess I mistook your 1st post for general curiosity, when it was really just preening.	0

In the rust belt actually Obama is still fairly popular.  While not huge, around 10-20% of voters voted for Trump but approve of Obama.  Obama had charisma and could connect with people whereas Clinton could not.  Believe it or not, charisma matters a lot and Trudeau like Obama but unlike Clinton has this.  If Obama could run for a third term, he would have carried Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania and maybe even Ohio and Iowa.  If you look at the county map in both elections, Obama was competitive and even won some white rural counties, whereas Clinton got slaughtered in them.	0

So, we know what will and won't work, but i suspect that the geniuses in local and state government will continue to try to police this problem away."	0
I can really agree with you on this.  Exalting the Priesthood conferred by ordination and barely giving a tip of the ecclesiastical hat to the Priesthood conferred by Baptism has been a large factor in creating this situation. The ontological change that is made so much of by the ordained is, in reality, a subset of the FUNDAMENTAL ontological change of Baptism. The leadership of the church deserves a D- in pastoral practice and practical theology.	0
"A well written, but sad article.  It disturbs me that in looking back, some describe blatant racism as a historical ""curiosity"" and sexism as a ""joke.""   They were neither at the time and nor should they be today.  It is not as if we have dispelled these horrible inclinations from the human race.  Rather, the battle continues on different fronts large and small.  Hate to say it, but when I look at the Outrigger Club and the Pacific Club today, I see vestiges of their discriminatory past practices lingering in their memberships, like the hereditary expression of  genes in familial blood lines, as undesirable or desirable as they may be . . . these places of privilege and exclusion may never truly escape their pasts.

Mr. Paliwoda it is possible that Trump doesn't want to win. That conclusion derives from assuming he is capable of rational thought.

It is useless to try and reason with irrational as he appears during many of his appearances and in his manic tweets.  Whether he wants to win or not, he won't win. His crazy, his meanness, and his dishonesty have been seen by too many.	0

The sight of all of the dead women and children that were reported in the news media may have influenced Trump's decision to retaliate for this attack.

This was simply a message to al-Assad, to cease using chemical weapons.   Their use is considered to be illegal under International law.  Don't you not agree with Trump on this point??

agree with author, we need to have healthcare for all.  but with this comes another problem - the lack of doctors and other healthcare workers.  to combat doctor's shortages, there should be a government sponsored program to provide financial assistance to aspiring physicians and with the financial assistance a pledge to practice in areas of doctor shortages.  having healthcare insurance for all does not insure good medical care if there are insufficient providers.	0

Researchers, please do better homework!  Fact; I don't want anyone in Alaska to lose one dime of the Permanent Fund!   Fact; I want to increase oil investment to help double the fund and increase annual PFD checks for all, ASAP!  Fact; I gave more money to the state in lease purchase agreements and rentals then most Alaskans do in their lifetimes, research my past lease sales results with the DNR DOG since 1983!   Fact; I help cause more oil and gas production at oil Fields like Redoubt Unit and I helped increase PFD  money from new oil then most anyone in Alaska.  Fact; oil and gas investors are good for exploring and drilling risky wildcat wells so Alaskans get more money  Did you know that 95% of all state leases I bid on in Alaska had no other bidders? So the state received money from me that they would have not received if I did not invest.   Fact; 25% of my millions of dollars to buy leases went to the Permanent fund that helps pay each Alaskan around $2,000.00 per year for free!	0

Testimony is evidence, and there was no lack of it. There was testimony about what he did and that testimony synced up with the photo, which definitely did not support his claim of his hand touching her rib. If you expect every trial to hinge on the introduction of incontrovertible photo evidence like you see on TV, you're likely to be very disappointed in the outcome of pretty much every real-life court case.  What this really reeks of was a guy suing a celeb for millions of dollars, hoping the celeb would settle quietly for less to avoid a court appearance, but Swift fought it instead. I am glad she did--celebrity or not, people shouldn't have to put up with that kind of stuff, and then get sued on top of it.	0
I agree. The bishops should have defied canon law, but canon law claims to be the oldest continuing legal system in the Western world. If someone is to be disciplined under any coherent legal system, they have to have done something in breach of that law. No one under canon law can be punished for obeying it. That’s a fundamental principle under any system of law.	0

I'm a Christian and agree with some of your points. I left my church because I got tired of them saying that the country was founded on religion.  It was founded on religious freedom--the right for people to practice the religion of their choice which to me includes no religion.  I was doing some reading recently and read one of the writers or signers of the Constitution stating that he didn't care how many Gods people worshiped, if any.  I do think that the morals of our society has gone downhill.  Also, the first colony of the U.S. was actually in St. Augustine, FL.  I think they were Catholics.  The U.S. was also settled by people that were running from a country that had a State religion, England.  Correct me on anything that is incorrect. Sometimes when I read a lot I forget things. Anyway, I do think some of the groups, such as the LGBT, have had some gains and now want everything, such as Christians businesses having to provide services.  I think this is so terribly wrong.

Catou: You can often find what you want by using a search vehicle by the name of Google. A quick search came up with this: http://dearbornpartners.com/uploads/upload/website/products/RD_and_the_interest_rate_cycle_2.pdf It not only shows the returns you were looking for (refer to the chart on page 4 for total returns by category) but also how dividend stocks perform in rising interest rate periods which I've referenced (specifically Ned Davis Research) numerous times in the past. I realize that your opinion of how dividend stocks perform when interest rates rise is exactly the opposite of what this research has proven.    Dividend-growth stocks produce better returns and fishing in that pond simply gives one better odds of successful results. SFI	0

No, there are not enough votes to remove him -- yet; they could get there if enough Republicans find their backbone and/or discern that their own careers are at risk. The only conceivable reason that Pence agreed to run as Trump's VP, and to serve in that office, is that he envisioned becoming president, sooner than later.  Removal under the twenty-fifth amendment seems entirely warranted, but I think it would leave the new president, and the country, in a weakened state. I think if Pence becomes president subsequent to impeachment, he would still be weak -- but the country would be better for having completed the public and bi-partisan impeachment process.  Pence has lost his reputation for integrity, to the extent that he had one: he's willingly become an apologist for the pathological liar who is his boss, and in that capacity he has lied for Trump and to him, aggressively and unapologetically.  He's damaged goods. Everyone who works for Trump is damaged, to one extent or another.	0

Erik, here is a compressed link that will be easy for you to click: http://bit.ly/1nCrLPw  It takes you to the zoning information where there are other easily clickable links to explain in detail the zoning of the McCormick Pier property. You will see that it is private land with a public access overlay. That means that the public can use it only during designated times of day, only for certain purposes, and only the path itself is open to the public. There are certain circumstances that allow the HOA to close the path, for instance it is allowed for maintenance and/or repair.  Please, let's move on to solutions to the real problems here. In the time it took you to post the same comment repeatedly, you could have done proper research. The HOA closed the path because that area has gotten way out of control, and a sense of lawlessness has taken over. There have been muggings, stabbings, rampant theft, public deification, littering and drug abuse. What would you propose to do about that?	0
It's not just looking at the face of your beloved child, who is kind, intelligent, compassionate, artistic, articulate, loving and seeing his tears. It's watching him become suicidal as he struggled to reconcile his orientation with the faith traditions of his parents. People tend to focus on the physical aspects of the gay relationship. But for him, the idea of living a life without companionship was more than he could bear.  He continues to struggle with loneliness. We live in a state with a very high teen suicide rate. Many of the successful suicide victims underwent the same struggles as my son, but often their families pushed them out or pushed them into damaging reparative therapy. Every time I hear of another suicide by a gay young person I realize that it could be mine.	0
More garbage fueled by the Washington Post which is owned by Jeff Bezos (amazon).  Dredging up something that allegedly happened 40 years ago.  Bezos, Gates, and Buffet are all flaming liberals.  The three of them  are worth more than the bottom half of the US citizens (160 million people).  When wealth is concentrated like this it leads to abuse.   The abuse is obvious when Bezos has the financial clout to buy a newspaper and destroy political opponents who threaten Bezo's world.  Bezos plans on taking over the grocery industry and the drug industry. It is time to break up these huge businesses.  It is time to tax the wealthy and take back the billions that they all made off the backs of working, poor Americans.  The attack on Judge Moore is despicable.

This revisionist view of the 50's is itself as revisionist view, and one that dangerously ignore the first half of the 20th century. What system that benefited white men? WWI killed a whole bunch of them, before universal suffrage existed (that's right, all men were able to vote ONLY when all women were allowed to), then the Great Depression came along, and no social safety net existed for anybody. Three of my four grandparents lost everything in the Depression, my grandmother wore a potato sack for clothes and nearly starved. And then the ten years before the '50's were spent fighting another World War that killed millions.  Only after the carnage, pain, destruction and death of the first 50 years that *everyone* suffered through, do we see, in the post-WWII world the sort of benefits that started to apply to all men, instead of only a handful of very rich, powerful and connected men at the very top enjoyed... within twenty years, these benefits were legislated to all.	0

I feel the budget should be cut much further than what it has been. We lived in the eras of lower oil before. I remember oil at $8 a barrel. The budget is bloated from the times of $100 oil which has not been the normal price of oil. After the budget is cut to fund the proper purposes of government, then I feel we should restructure the permanent fund. I feel it is ridiculous for the state to hand out money and then take it back in taxes. If we need a tax after that, it should be a flat sales tax that everyone is involved in paying. Just exempt the basics of life from the sales tax to protect the poor. Examples could be unprocessed food, shelter, housing, medicine, etc. Under an income tax almost half of the residents would pay little or no income tax at all. Why should those who pay no tax care what the costs of government were? The politicians would buy their votes by promising a chicken in every pot that someone else would have to pay for.	0

I am sure that I can figure out how to spend the wages of those the House Majority Coalition desire to punish with an income tax while continuing to support paying the PFD to the masses.    All they have to do is tax the wage earners more and gift their wages to the lower wage earners.  Problem solved.  Perhaps they could make the PFD $8,000 or some other high figure.  Where does the wealth distribution scheme that the House Majority Coalition desires end?    Extremely childish behavior being displayed by the House Majority Coalition in my opinion.

Tuckerman Babcock is back on the pages of the ADN propagandizing and spinning like a top. The simple facts are these:  1. No amount of political manipulation that led to this mess can match the unconstitutional gerrymander that put Coghill and Kelly in the Senate and made Kevin Meyer Senate President. This happened in 2012 and the resulted in the Parnell Giveaway called SB 21.  2. Cathy Geisel's conflict-of-Interest re: Oil Ties is more germane than Vince Beltrami's support of Bill Walker if Mr Republican Party wants to lay blame for failure to address the long term fiscal challenges our state faces.  3.

For each of the next three years, assuming no significant increase in the price of oil, what (in precise numerical terms, please) should the ratio of reductions in expenditures to increases in revenue be?	0

"I couldn't get past the sentence declaring the drive time from London to Toronto to be 2 hours.  On what day of the week and what hour of the day would this be happening?  Certainly not during rush hour or construction season.  High speed rail would circumvent the traffic which makes that ""2 hour"" drive more along the lines of 3 plus hours on a good day.  Furthermore, doing business in Toronto isn't just about commuting into an office tower daily. It isn't just about ""jobs"".  Many people do much of their work on line and require some face to face meetings each week.  High speed rail would facilitate the new world of work, and help people strike a work/life balance, while being able to live in truly livable communities.  You know, ones where the notion of having more than a tiny balcony to access the great out of doors isn't a pipe dream, and does actually cost less than 7 figures.

Well, it may be that the statement about not being in a floodplain is accurate.  A floodplain is predicated on the elevation and the probability of the land being inundated (ie: covered) by water during a high water event.  This is not a flooding problem, none of the houses are being inundated by high water.  This is an erosion problem, which is a completely separate problem.	0

You started this thing by protesting what I wrote. If you didn't like what I wrote, you don't have to read it. If you protest against it, at least try to understand where I am coming from. But from the get go, you attacked without merit, telling me that my opinion is lesser then Kaeparnick's, saying that I am criticizing and you consistency argued that I am wrong and you are right. Sorry, lady....I don't kowtow to you. ""You shouldn't write letters to newspapers and state your opinions."" so you wrote. Are you a vile hypocrite??? Then you wrote: ""I would never say you shouldn't write letters to newspapers and express your opinion. That would make me an idiot, and very un-American.""

Oregon legalized sales of marijuana at the same time that Alaska did, and they had millions in new tax revenue in 2015....2015.  http://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-marijuana-sales-market-report/  What they did not have was the Pete Kelly's and other legislators trying to stop the intent of the voters every chance that they had. The State is in a hard fiscal time, and yet legislators and our citizens continue to work against a new revenue source as proven....proven....proven in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon. Alaska could have simply followed what Colorado had done and be receiving revenue now.	0

"Excerpts from the NFL League Rulebook pages A62-63:  ""The National Anthem must be played prior to every NFL game and all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem.  During the National Anthem, players on the field and bench area should stand at attention, face the flag, hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking.  Failure to be on the field at the start of the National Anthem may result in discipline, such as fines, suspensions and the forfeiture of draft choice(s) for violations of the above, including first offenses.""    In addition, The NFL elaborates that it will not allow players to convey messages “which relate to political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns.”  Tim Tebow takes a knee to honor his God and gets slammed.  Two hundred players take the knee during the National Anthem and Commissioner Goodell and many owners say they're proud of those players.  Go Figure."	0

One side effect of housing prices rising so high that only overseas money is purchasing, is playing out right now here in Richmond BC.  I have two friends who have been unable to sell their west Richmond homes. They have each received only one low ball developer offer.  Why? The traditional working family that could once afford to purchase is priced right out. The only money that has been buying sf detached here is offshore sourced, or the developers who tear down and sell to offshore money.  And offshore money for a house has so much to choose from now, as the insane high prices means they are the only players left.   We have lost local control of our homes.	0

The author again doesn't understand the game.  About the simplest offense you can run is running back left running back right.  Even the worst defense in the NFL can stop that just by putting 7 players in the box and brining the DBs up close.  Even if you throw a very conservative passing game into this mix it won't work with the current offensive line.  There is a reason Denver has given up so many sacks - it isn't because the QB is holding the ball for 6 or 8 seconds.  The QBs only have 2 maybe 3 seconds to pass and unless all receivers are running routes within 5 to 7 yards ... the OLine has to provide the QB 4 seconds to pass and the QBs haven't had this.  Only time they do get this is if the defense is only rushing 3 and many times even with just 3 rushing the QB is being rushed.	0

Continued … I don't know how you came across this website, perhaps by chance like I did some years ago, because it has the word ‘Catholic’ in its title. I am a cradle Catholic yet I was appalled by what I was reading here.  Naively, I once believed that Catholics throughout the world believed in what the Church taught, alas I was mistaken. Mind you I had naively ignored several warning signs within my extended family that this was not so. I am at least grateful to NCReporter for waking me up to the fact that my relatives beliefs and behaviours were not untypical of modern Catholics. I am often asked why I post here on this website since I am in so much disagreement with it and its regular posters. The reason is because of people such as yourself who may come across this site may think that the articles and comments here are representative of Catholicism and at least I can give evidence to the contrary. May God bless you and your endeavour.	0

The obvious scapegoating of wayward statesmen's war crimes and evitable wars on the infantry is obvious. Our entire system let Bergdahl down. What ever happened to accountability in this country? This dishonor is on the war criminals still at large and not on this soldier, full stop.  Because the war was a criminal act, the criminals own and are culpable for all of its failings, lock, stock, and barrel. All of them. Every last single one is only their fault and the fault of all those who set decency aside to wantonly implement this dark thing and perpetuate it upon US citizens and humanity alike.  Did you think we would forget about this? Did you think we would let it slide if you ran down the clock a bit?

People will take the path of least resistance, which right now is camping in a park, or under an overpass or on the side of H-1.

Oh where to begin. First, Wente repeats the big lie about face coverings being an Islamic religious requirement. They are not. They are archaic misogynistic practices hiding under the guise of religion. Second, Wente goes on to quote polls showing wide support for the ban. The reason why we have a constitution with a Charter of Rights and Freedoms is so the tyranny of the majority doesn’t encourage the government to say, tell us how to dress. Third Wente references European counters with bans as if they are pillars of tolerance. Germany, need I say more and Norway, which until 1977 forcibly sterilized member of its Romani minority. She is right about one thing. Laws like this encourage retrenchment by some.  But I would like to see some statistics on what percentage of daughters, whose immigrant mothers wear the face covering, end up wearing the face covering as well. I bet the percentage is near zero.	0

I agree that within this capitalist hegemony you can find shining examples, yet they are fewer than what you find in a true democratic socialist state where the majority of people are middle class. Nobody should be working so they can practically beg for scraps to survive,which is basically what tipping is. Also just because something doesn't take as much skill doesn't mean it doesn't need to be done. Why should people have to move to other professions to earn a living if they like the profession they are in? Many of those who work for places like McDonalds or Walmart like their jobs and would like to stay in them, yet they are forced out because they cannot make a living wage doing them. Or they end up having to take two jobs to survive. I remember in my parents' day that it was normal to work for 25 years for a company and get a gold watch and a pension out of it, and now that is impossible.	0

THE BIGGEST NEWS of Mueller Monday, the rollout of a money-laundering indictment against Donald Trump’s former campaign adviser, Paul Manafort and campaign aide Rick Gates, and the unsealing of a false-statements plea deal by another campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos, may involve someone not named explicitly in either indictment: Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  That’s because Sessions has repeatedly testified to the Senate that he knows nothing about any collusion with the Russians.   But the Papadopoulos plea shows that Sessions, then acting as Trump’s top foreign policy adviser, was in a March 31, 2016, meeting with Trump, at which Papadopoulos explained “he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.”   Papadopoulos’s plea perhaps hurts Trump the most.    After all, Trump was in the March 31 meeting too, along with Sessions.	0

Your idea makes more sense than current public transportation systems. 1. Existing buses are slow: a bus carrying 50 people has to stop every block to let 2 people on or off while the remaining 48 passengers wait. 2. Existing buses pollute more than cars: A 2010 U.S. study found that buses consume 4118 BTUs per passenger-mile, verses cars' 3447 BTUs per passenger-mile. Think about it: you have to stop and accelerate an 18-ton bus just to let two people off, and then drive that 18-ton bus around with just two people on board during off-peak hours. 3. Existing buses slow traffic: the entire traffic lane has to stop while the bus lets 2 people on or off. Anecdotally, city street traffic moved smoother and quicker during Ottawa's bus strike, despite more cars on the road.	0

The simple fact is -- Canada may have a merchandise trade surplus with the USA (greater when the price of oil is high) however the overall trade deficit with the USA is a deficit for Canada when you include services and tourism.  i.e. Canadian tourists spend far more in the USA than Americans do in Canada.  The Canadian Trade Representatives need to continually point this out to the Americans.  Trump is not an idiot, he will recognize this.  On a side note, with Junior and his policies I do see a 60 cent dollar in the horizon.	0

You see, the problem is that he has not yet put any policies on the table that I can analyze.  The immigration thing was a campaign promise and in the overall context of American prosperity, unimportant.  When policies on taxes, war, medical care, etc. are put on the table, the policies can be discussed, alternatives considered, and mature consideration of national options can take place.  This will require the libber population to behave more responsibly and turn away from personality bashing and focus on issues.  By the way, I love how the media is not reporting that the federal government subsidy of expanded ACA medicaid was set to expire as it was leaving expanded medicaid a financial nightmare for the states.

Your post pretends this is a race issue, it is not.  It is a financial class issue.  The Canadian government was cruel when it set up its investor immigrant program in the 1980s. It was basically a selfish plan of Canada to vacuum up as many millionaires from Hong Kong as possible. What Canada basically did was to tell poor and middle class folks in Hong Kong, well, tough luck, guys, we do not care that you are about to be taken over by Beijing at the upcoming hand-over. But we will vacuum up as many of your millionaire neighbours there as we can and offer them safety in Canada.  That was unethical, cruel, a mistake.  What Canada SHOULD have done was to set up immigration that accepts the SAME number of people from Hong Kong and China, but from financial strata representative of financial strata of Canadians, not hoarding in millionaires.  If that had been done, Vancouver real estate would not be in its present state, it would be affordable for local workers.  It is not about race.	0

Hello Silverhorn -  It is not my intention to argue back and forth with you; you have your view of the presidents, I have mine, and the difference of opinion, as they say, is what makes a horse race.  But I will respond, especially where you are factually suspect.  There is 9/11 warnings are documented fact.  Look it up.  9/11 report or wikipedia or politifact, among  numerous credible sources.  Saddam was a complete piece of garbage, but it was up to the locals to get rid of him, not us, and we just stirred the pot and made things worse, and at least under him things were stable.    But you pull a rhetorical bait and switch when you pivot from job creation to unemployment rate,  Bush inherited 4.2% unemployment when he took office (thanks, Democrats!).  When he left unemployment was 7.8%.  Obama inherited 7.8% unemployment (thanks, Republicans) and brought it down to 4.6% when he left.  Obama created millions of new jobs, net job creation under Bush was negative.  Look it up...	0

"""clear and present danger""  Overstatement always adds to one's prestige and following.   Makes others want to come back.   Credibility booster.

Then there was the time in Africa where we met up with insurgents from AIAI.   There was some pucker that night.   And so I am so happy to re-calibrate here using NCR criteria about ""clear and present danger""."	0

"I don't think there is anything wrong with acknowledging the cultural losses suffered by indigenous people resulting from what I'll call the process of discovery and acquisition. Its actually quite heartbreaking. (Drums of Diomede is a good book for perspective). I am white and I grew up in the Alaska bush.  Its a misguided idea to think that there is any need for ""formulating a way to help Alaska Native culture rebound as a proud people"" and I'd go as far as to say that statement is pretty harsh. Their cultural loss is staggering. Their generational cultural loss is immeasurable. There is no going back - only forward.  I learned young that ""proud"" is not a word I should use to describe the Alaska native - in fact, it's a bit of an insult. They are strong, intuitive, intelligent, focused, amazingly and instinctively tuned into the natural world. My experience is that they have a death grip on their culture.  Suggesting that they need help with it is a statement of ignorance."	0

Did does not make sense : You don't support this program but you'll support the guy who ran that program because he'd bring some fresh ideas?   As far as fresh ideas: 'Grenn has been connected to politics for much of his life, starting in his childhood when his father worked as an aide to the late Ramona Barnes, the steely Anchorage Republican who was the first woman speaker of the Alaska House.'  That means that Grenn learned very early on how and who to serve:  --- moneyed-interests like the ones at the Rasmuson Foundations's Pick,Click, Give program, GCI's Ron Duncan and AK Dispatch's Alice Rogoff, unions, among others;   --- lobbyists (who were royally served by Ms. Ramona and her staff);  They all own Grenn lock, stock and barrel...especially so because at his tender, young age he hasn't yet developed what it takes to tell them to bug off...mortgage and three hungry mouths to feed notwithstanding.  We need more thoughtful reps - not ones who decide to run for office on the fly.	0
I just want to assure you that healthy diet is best defense for the body. Maintaining Proper Oral Hygiene is a first priority to prevent flu.

Firstly the criticism of small business  demonstrates that most of the Liberal supporters have no clue what's going on.  Most small business make about 60 thousand - so much of the conversation about them is meaningless.

It is understandable why someone living in India would want to retreat into a quite, private place and deny the world.

They need the guidance of an intelligent adult rather than being told to master their own emotions through some flaky Eastern fad that won't die. Nor do they need to be doing yoga.

"No Mr. Cole repealing the $700 Million/year oil industry subsidies by themselves would not balance the budget but it is damn near 25% of the deficit. But the optics of taking $700 Million from the PFD and then giving that much to the wealthiest corporations on earth is just a non-starter for the majority of Alaskans. We are paying for 65% of the development costs of new projects but once those projects come online they will all be deemed ""new oil"" and we will receive such a minimal production tax as to never recoup our investment. As in the Governors original balanced plan of cuts and revenue increases, it all has to be on the table or none of it can be. Repeal the oil subsidies and then the people may more readily accept the contribution we all will make with a $1,000 reduction in the PFD as well as new income and sales taxes."	0
What Charles calls a lack of enthusiasm by my administration is more aptly known as facing fiscal reality.

The 15 million dollar state grant that we received was a result of our hard work promoting our capital projects program with the state legislature and legislators made it very clear that there was not going to be additional funding.	0

Well, you could use this article as a case study for the larger problems in our society - the normalisation of lying, cheating, dishonesty and the fact that large segments of the population simply dont care that they are being lied to, etc.  What are the implications when we the people no longer care? We get leaders like trump - who people know is lying, he knows he's lying, there are people defending his lies, etc.  And what are the possible kinds of social ills that might emanate from this?	0

"And in 1858 your reply could have read: ""They are shouting at the wind unless they listen to the arguments on both sides. I have not seen many anti-slavers display an understanding of why the Court believed and continues to believe in why Scott or Mann were rightly decided. Until they can really understand the argument, they will only oppose these cases on the basis of their feelings about the result. That is now how law works.""

"A very tragic part of the documentary focussed on Trumps elder brother. At one point the brother attempted to improve the housing for tenants, housing for which he had responsibility. The father went ballistic when he found out, slaughtering his son and accusing him of needlessly wasting money.  The father sidelined him and handed over the businesses to someone who would exploit and make money from the tenants, not improve their housing - Trump! (It was then that Trump began telling African Americans that there was 'no room at the Inn' while handing the rooms to whites only.)   The lawyer representing the government at the ensuing court case was on last night's programme. She said she was absolutely shocked when Trump saddled up to her outside the court and said to her, ""Oh, come on, no one wants to live beside these people.""  Tragically, the older brother drank himself to death. No wonder. Trumps response, ""He was a great man but he didn't have the correct genes.""  A disgusting man!"	0

Not only that, but I followed up that sentence with one which VERY clearly stipulated that the first instance (normal people's lives taking precedence) is ""when someone becomes violent and dangerous.""  It is a very logical and definitive ""if/then"" statement.  It is certainly NOT a ""have at it, kill the guy no matter what"" statement.

There are four major Christian Healthcare not for profit organizations that are exempt from Obamacare.  Their benefits vary significantly, but in general terms they do not pay for on going prescription drugs, mental health, addiction services, pre existing conditions for the first 2 to 5 years and typical items not covered.  In general they pay for hospitalization, surgeries, major medical, doctor visits, etc.  Co pays in general range from $250 to $2,500.  If a person is in good health they maybe an alternative.  You can google it and read about them.  Also, the degree of religious faith required varies from a weekly practicing Christian to a general belief statement that you believe all people have a right to worship the God of their choice in the manner of their choice.  Make sure you do your due diligence by obtaining at least three years of tax returns(Form 990) and audited financial statements.

Where does this belief of ""improvement via competition"" come from?  Public schools have never competed with non-public schools and the very concept itself is even less feasible when funds are stripped from public schools."	0

"It's amusing that the media, ADN included, insist there is no comma in the First Amendment separating two ideas;  ""abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press.""

"We need to think about the future and what Canada needs to produce for its own good. Cross border trade is more ancient than the Silk Road. It's not going away. We have weak Liberal Ministers - both Economic and Foreign Affairs are clearly incompetent. Canadians need to be aware they are turning the country into a banana republic. The issue at hand is financing production and the flow of capital across borders. All the government bailouts over the past decade or more indicate that capitalism is not successful at wealth creation, job creation or appropriate allocation of resources for the benefit of the people who make up the real economy. The global system is an extension of mercantilism. Exploiting ""colonies"" is not cool anymore. Mexico is a trading partner and it is inappropriate to exploit the country and its people.

"Yes, but even on a less traumatic level than Stockholm Syndrome, women typically do not identify with gender as a class, they identify or assimilate with the immediate men in their life.  Behind every angry white man who voted for Trump  there was an angry white woman who also voted for him. They found it easy to dismiss his bragging about sexual predatory behavior as mere ""locker room banter"" - just like Trump's own wife stated on TV, because it's important for their psychological survival to keep their solidarity with  these key partners in their life. It's interesting to note that when women have lived among other groups of women, and shared their common experiences, and identity (such as our LCWR nuns) they began to identify by gender as women, and this led them to see the root of their oppression more clearly and to question the truth and their loyalties."	1

Hydro was the cleanest, most efficient power 60 years ago.  Now with advances in technology the old style of one huge power plant connected by a grid is quickly becoming obsolete. For household purposes, more and more people will be using alternative sources (geothermal, solar, etc.) especially when (not if) BC Hydro rates escalate to pay for Site C.  Current BC Hydro facilities on the Peace and Columbia will be sufficient for supplementary energy needs.  Household use of power has not increased in at least 10 years, while demand for exports has decreased, since the US is increasingly self sufficient. (Las Vegas runs on solar power) Industrial use has been in decline in BC as well, and pulp producers are reaching a tipping point where it would be more efficient (and cheaper) to co-generate their own electricity. 100 years from now, arable farm land might be the prime need, which is under threat from Site C.	0

"In a faith where tradition is literally sacred, and part of the Nicene creed and the Apostle's creed, how can they still call themselves Catholic? In the creed we say that we believe in ""one, holy, apostolic and catholic church""  Apostolic meaning the same faith as given to the apostles by Christ. Catholic means universal, not just international, but that it is the same faith regardless of how times change, meaning that a Catholic from the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th...19th 20th 21st century should believe the same things.  If you believe the apostolic church fathers, the desert fathers and the desert mothers were, wrong how can you be catholic?   So many humble women, both lay and religious in my diocese basically manage and plan everything in the church, except for the liturgy."	0

While the press can make up a story, get the headline out in public and then when the story is shown to be make up, the press apologizes on page 2-C, but the damage has all ready been done.

Hi! Scott  1) Generally Roman Catholics would say I received the sacrament of Reconciliation/Holy Communion not “I participate in any/all sacraments of my choosing” We do not participate in the Sacrament of Confession/ Reconciliation we receive forgiveness through it.  2) Previously you said   “I've consulted with several parish priests over the years who support the *responsible* use of contraception, I trust they have employed the same God-given ability of discernment as you and I”.  Now you are saying “contraception was not the sole purpose of our meetings but the topic invariably came up”  No priest would recommend/advise sterilization (the snip).  3) In reply to 3, The Church has always maintained the historic Christian teaching that deliberate acts of contraception are always gravely sinful, which means that it is mortally sinful if done with full knowledge and deliberate consent (CCC 1857). This teaching cannot be changed and has been taught by the Church infallibly.  Continued	0

"Religion's Common Sacrament - beyond schizophrenia! SOIL IS LIFE, in the present as in the past. Our bodies are earth-dust, as we are reminded on Ash Wednesday. Religious ideology aside, we need to celebrate life's ONENESS in NATURE. Human well-being supposes Nature's well-being. Wars of religious ideologies are destroying Nature, our selves! In Earth Sacrament we are One Church, One People. In ideological division, we are self-destroying and losing true religious sense. We need to speak to the urgency of CHURCHES UNITED if we hope to have a future; senseless wasting  of earth/ water species is nothing less than SACRILEGE! Relationship (religion) is bondedness of self-conscious life in land/ water; ecology IS Church in Common. Time is NOW for us seriously to celebrate Earth-Life Sacrament together. We should pray: ""Let peace begin with me""! and all work to heal our mortally hurting Earth Mother. CHURCHES DIVIDED are destroying us and our future - the challenge to today's generations!"	0

"“What is not difficult to suggest is that without that organised agency of change there can be no fundamental transformation. The working class is the driving force in this regard.”  The words of former ""intelligence"" minister Ronnie Kasrils.

This is an outrage.  Authorities should have already gone their and cited those involved . Everything used in the hunt should be confiscated .    Alaska natives feel they are above the law .

It' s way past time to start busting every native caught breaking the law--exactly like they do everyone else.   For these so called native leaders to tell their people to stick together against those investigating and boast they won't give back their illegal catch is the greatest outrage.

I respect your point SANS FLANGI even in disagreement there is a mutual respect that we always shared in our differences.    But tell me for a moment, you have a good mind,  what do you think about that meeting between Jack Ebel and the governor, it's context they admit to having discussed in detail, then when questioned about the meeting and the issues discussed, the governor's statement concerning the name of Evan Ebel not being mentioned when the focus of that meeting was on the very incarceration conditions Mr. Evan Ebel was experencing?   Then came the governor's angry live response in public to a channel 9 reporter concerning access to the governor being denied if that line of questioning was repeated?    I think the excuse was very weak, since both had been longtime friends going back long before the governor's political career even was thought about. What's your take on these events since the Denver Post editorial article omits this interesting point many of us remember well?	0

""History has long shown us that when a *non*-religious portion of any given citizenry comes under the thumb of the *religious* population of that very same citizenry horrible things happen.""  I believe the Spanish Inquisition would be considered close to that. Many of the 'Christian' religions have long held pagans, witches, and wiccans to be quite loathsome, and terrible things happened to them. I think the current situation in Turkey, with the Muslim officials taking action against the secular military, falls under that banner. I can offer more examples if you'd like..............."	0

"The other issue that needs to be addressed is what are the penalties that must be meted out by the Universities for false accusations?  Surely the accuser must risk the same penalties as the accused for frivolous lawsuits, even in a University setting.  Only with an objective definition of sexual assault can a rational decision be made that an assault actually occurred.  One's ""feelings"" can have very little to do with a sexual assault charge, and such a response would not hold up in a state or federal court, where most true rape cases should be adjudicated.          The presence of alcohol or drugs does not absolve either party from responsibility in sexual activities.  It also seems to me that a longstanding sexual relationship between a couple needs to be treated differently than a single encounter. If multiple partners(of both sexes) are involved, then things become much, much more complicated, making an objective definition of sexual assault that much more critical.  Finally one"	0

I spent some time reading on the history of remarriage in the east, not nearly enough to be an expert. It seems that the idea of remarriage was not universal in the church and only crept in during the 9-10th century right before the schism.   Besides we have to follow our own tradition, and the indissolubly of marriage is certainly affirmed in the west for all its existence. I really don't see any theological reasons for the Orthodox practice, especially how arbitrary the limit of remarriages has been set. It seems more like an invention by man, to avoid suffering for the faith.	0

"The non-resident oil workers are in a higher earning group, they could deduct from Federal Taxes. Jay Hammond intended the Dividend for citizens, not government. It also worked as a yearly stimulus that all businesses need. Finally, it gave Alaska residents a stake in their mineral wealth (Hickel, Hammond et al, ""The Owner State""). As far as those ""services""? We don't really have any: we have employees that provide very little. The Education system from kindergarten to University is so top heavy it is laughable, without tangible results especially at the High School level. And a state with this small of a population can't afford such an extensive University system: UAA is fine. I'm pro excellent benefits, but not when it is state workers who are supposed to be ""serving"" the very citizens who have no benefits whatsoever. Alaska spends double other states per capita on services...that has to end, especially when the results are high crime, bad roads, poor economic future."	0

Mr. Johnston is a good-hearted man who travelled the world as Canada's representative. He talks about the need for pluralism, tolerance & understanding in Canada, but surely his travels have shown him that, though Canada may not be perfect, it leads 'the pack' when compared to other nations.  Look at https://www.populationpyramid.net/population-size-pe-country/2017 to look at some of the source nations for migrants & refugees to Canada. Most have primarily homogeneous huge populations where culture is guarded against change: China - 1,388,232,963 people, India - 1,342,512,706, Pakistan - 196,744,376, Nigeria - 191,835,936, Bangladesh - 164,827,718, Ethiopia - 104,344,901, Philippines - 103,796,832 and many others, while Canada's mixed population stands at 36,626,083. Canada is one of a very FEW nations who try to accommodate others.

Now, of course, in the day where anything is ""fake news"" because some dweeb on the Net says so would make this fact ""fake news"" as well.  As another leader, similar in view to Trump, said ""All this was inspired by the principle–which is quite true within itself–that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.""

Racial character we cant ignore is white, in a nutshell we extend the scope of monopoly to include all but will primarily focus on white so we will still reflect to its racial connotation.

In the short term, anything is possible. In a world with an ever increasing population and a rising appetite for consumerism, nothing can stay the same forever.

2. The only thing modern science has disproven in regard to water fluoridation are the myriad false claims and misinformation put forth by antifluoridationists such as “nyscof” who have no respect for truth or accuracy.  3. Because healthy teeth can occur without fluoride is not a reason to deprive entire populations of the very valuable benefit of fluoridation.  4. The FDA has no jurisdiction over the contents of drinking water supplies. That jurisdiction falls entirely under the US EPA. What the FDA classifies anything is obviously of no relevance to water fluoridation.  5. There is no valid, peer-reviewed scientific evidence of any “adverse side effects” of optimal level fluoride.....as evidenced by “nyscof’s” inability to provide any such evidence.  to continued..........

Free speech??? Why do Conservatives use Orwellian phrases? What he meant to say is he wants to censor liberal thought and promote fundamentalist thinking.  It's a myth that conservative ideas are being suppressed at university and college. Numerous stories are passed around in the USA and none have been proven to be true.  Indeed, in the USA, you're just as likely to hear the Right urge the suppression of liberal ideas. Ann Coulter wrote a book about it. Trump urged his followers to gang up on liberals.  Free Speech? Okay, so that explains why Harper put stuff through in so many omnibus bills. Why public discussions were rushed through in a few towns and on a tight schedule.  Babyface Scheer can pretend to be the smiling Harper 2.0, but he's still Harper. And that smile is starting to look a little creepy.	0

"I had the same question about the definition of Catholic used in this poll.  Did the poll survey only the ""pay, pray, and obey"" Catholics (tending towards an older demographic) who regularly go to Mass on Sundays and consider abortion their top voting issue?  Or those that self-identify as Catholic because they were raised Catholic (tending towards a younger demographic), probably only go to Church on Christmas and Easter with their parents, and consider social justice their top voting issue?  It would be interesting to see how the results of this poll would look if subdivided to reflect the voting choices of these two distinctly different groups of self-identifying Catholic voters.  Based upon observations within my parish, family, and circle of friends, the latter group appears to be growing while the former group is declining."	0

Despite his behaviour, Congress will still show Mr Trump the respect the president's office should receive. They will wait until they have all of their questions ready and depose him at a location he is comfortable with (e.g. White Hours or Mar Largo) as they have done in the past with previous presidents.  It is still early. We haven't heard from General Flynn yet. If Mr Trump was trying to obstruct the investigation of Mr Flynn then I suspect he has something to say.  My guess. Is it is regarding Trump's Russian engagements. Perhaps shady Russian financing of hotels or Russian prostitutes during the Miss Universe pageant as some have suggested. Not necessarily illegal - just embarrassing. It would explain a lot about his behaviour.  It is like a train wreck in slow motion - I don't like it but I can't stop watching :)	0

With limited space, labels are easier than trying to write a paragraph explaining the various nuances of someone's position.  In the case of the baker, I would call him a religious zealot, which is probably even closer to the mark than calling him a homophobe.

Yes, I have read both the ACA and the new legislation in Congress. I don't care who is the originators of the ACA as you seem to be shrill to blame the Republicans under any circumstance.  The Democrats passed the ACA without one Republican voting to support it.  That is a fact.  Your rant will not change that fact.  The problem from the start was how the ACA could be paid for.  Simple.  The Supreme Court validated the ACA based on essentially one issue, the ACA was and is a new tax.  Deferring  the collection of those taxes only makes the ACA an unaffordable program.  Either pay for it or end the ACA.  As it stands, the Republican bill only solves part of the ACA's financial problems. Like meth addicts, the newly minted beneficiaries of the ACA are bleeding this country's health care industry dry without an ounce of tax revenue as provided by the ACA. It is simple math 1 + 1 = 2, not 15 in five or ten years as the Beltway Bandits tell us.	0

Obama did promise, erroneously, that under the ACA people could keep their doctor and their plan. However, many people get their health insurance through their employer, and nothing prevents the employer from changing plans and coverage. Obama was wrong, and I always felt that he either knew or should have known that he was wrong. I accept that this constitutes a lie in the ordinary meaning of the word; I was and remain disappointed that Obama made this promise. But Obama's broken promise pales next to Trump's. Obama campaigned on a vision of health care; proposed it; pursued it and eventually signed it. Trump has lied every time he speaks about healthcare. He promised healthcare for everyone (universal health care), cheaper and better than the ACA. He has never proposed a bill that looks like that; instead he's been backing various bills, each one worse than the last, that strip health insurance from millions of people. Trump is militantly anti-life, pro-sickness, pro-death.	0

Our economy will be in the doldrums for decades with no means to stimulate economic activity. 2) Foreign relations ( a pass on dealing so far with the US government,  a fail on lifting requirements for Mexican visas to Canada with increased asylum applications,  obvious pandering to the Chinese for nothing in return by selling Canadian interests against Professional advise) 3) Disingenuous actions by Trudeau (Nannygate, expensive vacations with millionaires while taxing the so called ""rich"") 4) poor handling of refugees crossing the US Canadian border.

"B.Carfree:  You're quite right.  We currently fail to fund those community-based services so badly needed by a significant number of mentally-ill Oregonians.  Small community-based residential facilities; walk-in clinics; short term crisis/evaluation centers; intervention teams (such as Cahoots) and, when needed, supervised medication dosing.  We've focused our resources at the far end of the continuum of services.....locked-ward incarceration and, by doing so, have insured that those other programs will be underfunded (or unfunded) and those individuals in need will not be helped.    The JC facility needs to be closed.  Those patients needing ""locked-ward"" placement need to be housed in Salem and those patients in the hospital system (JC and Salem) who can be better and for cost-effectively service in small community-based facilities need to go there.  This could release millions to be dedicated to those sorely needed community-based programs.    regards, Gary"	0

"Thank you for this clarification. In am not aware of the Tierney case. Did you mean to say ""as the lawyers [instead of plaintiffs]...decided to abandon their client"" (otherwise I don't understand).   In very general terms, I think there are three levels of failed responsibility: first the perpetrators (and by extension, as you put it, those at the scene of the crime who failed the victims); second the bishops collectively driven, say I, above all by the desire to avoid scandal rather than empathy for the victims (and in the early days, by their lack of understanding of the nature of pedophilia, a deficiency then shared by society at large); and thirdly, the Vatican and pope for supporting rather than correcting the college of bishops. On this, I take it and accept that we are completely at odds."	0

Someday, perhaps partly because of the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission and its 94 Calls to Action, someone will ask: If we have learned to change our views of the Indian Residential Schools because of the violence inherent in that system, then why is it that we still look at violence, especially these battles, as the birth of a nation?  I love the stories of the 20th Century wars, I really do. They are critical in reaching an understanding of my parents and, therefore, of myself. But I also know we must let some things go if we are to have a visionary, justice seeking place in the future   I am not saying we should forget, but there is truth that doesn't get visited enough, and, perhaps, still a little reconciliation as we live in the shadow of lives ruined by war.  The Indian Residential Schools system and World War 1, in particular, were part of an idea that Canada must be British. It is time to consider the possibility that that doesn't make sense.	0

"While the author seems to have reasonable credentials his piece is so riddled with errors of fact that his opinions become irrelevant.  And this is merely an opinion piece. But to reference ""journalism"" in his education and profession would seem to oblige him to provide a more substantive basis for his screed. Perhaps his promised next piece will be more fact based and less hysterical.   As an example, and something Cook Lauer never chose to reveal (it took John Burnett taking over the HTH campaign to finally fess up); the bike and the surfboard were paid for by the Mayor as personal expenses within the normal cycle.  This author ignores that and declares the Mayor a thief.  BTW, read the charges, none are based on actual use  but rather the reporting of it. Pretty thin gruel for all the column yards the Trib has filled, each with the cut n pasted 7 paragraphs of similar out of context facts that this author uses.

"meantime on rorate-caeli :    ""Considerations on the dubia of the four cardinals"" by John R. T. Lamont, PhD  .....the Pope by pertinaciously maintaining heresy effectively removes himself from office. However, all these explanations agree that a Pope who is juridically guilty of heresy can and must be removed from office. There is no dispute among Catholic theologians on this point – even among theologians like Bellarmine who do not think that a Pope is in fact capable of being a heretic.             It is to be hoped that the correction of Pope Francis does not have to proceed this far, and that he will either reject the heresies he has announced or resign his office. Removing him from office against his will would require the election of a new Pope, and would probably leave the Church with Francis as an anti-Pope contesting the authority of the new Pope. If Francis refuses to renounce either his heresy or his office, however, this situation will just have to be faced."	0

"This is such a old and tired argument, last i checked it's not 1966 anymore.  Southern democrats were unhappy with Harry Truman (D) enacting desegregation and began to call themselves ""States Rights Democratic Party"" aka Dixiecrats.  But starting in 1964 after Lyndon Johnson (D) signed the civil rights act, this bloc fell apart and conservative democrats began abandoning the increasingly liberal party for the GOP which was beginning to espouse states' rights issues and increasingly conservative ideas.  You're living in a fantasy world, the GOP doesn't get to claim the moral high ground for what their founders did 100 years ago if their policies today are the exact opposite."	0

I have zero respect for any player that protests in this manner.  You're entitled to your opinion, of course, but you don't allow your political opinions to impact you on the job.  The flag and the national anthem is about so much more than Donald Trump.  You have a public profile as an entertainer; stop pretending that your political views matter to anyone else.   If this continues to be an issue, sports leagues should simply stop playing the national anthem prior to the game.  It's not part of the game and it's not necessary for the game.  If it becomes a problem for people, get rid of it.	0

Wow for a minute there I thought we had a real problem, shoplifting? This nation needs to get it through its head punishment is not a deterrent, the states with the death penalty have the highest rate of crime and murder.  Alternately if you look at nations where punishment is low crime is low. All get tough on crime does is get tough on budgets. We now incarcerate more people than any nation on earth thats not per capita and is crimes down? Till this nation is ready to deal with the underlying causes of crime then it will not change. Drug addiction, poverty, and lack of education drive crime, but we have to build a wall, we have to build a fighter jet that does not work, we have to go fight another middle east war.

Gingrich is wrong.  Yes, the Senate President and President should work together where possible but  McConnell is not on Trump's team and same with Speaker Paul Ryan. As long as they hold their present positions, it will not be possible for Trump to move his agenda along. He gave them the benefit of the doubt but I hope he realizes now that these two are part of the swamp and are in it for themselves.  A great start would be if he got rid of that Judas goat, HR McMasters and also stopped listening to Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka who have given Trump very bad advise.  Trump should know by now that he is his own best adviser and he should follow his instincts and listen to God's guidance.	0

"A lot of the tension that surrounds immigration and safety, and accusations of xenophobia, are because of seemingly unequal application of the principal that is being used to push ""extreme vetting"". In my reading of the comments here and elsewhere, the logic is that 1) there is a risk of harm to Americans by immigrants so 2) we will make the process of immigration more rigorous so that 3) we will be safe. Fine, let's take this at face value and say that it's true. Then why is the enthusiasm that is generated for this approach not being applied equally across other risks? For instance, in 2014, a little less than 10,000 people in the United States died in car accidents where a driver was drunk. This is a MUCH more likely way to be injured than by an immigrant, refugee, etc. Why is there not the same logic being applied to this risk of injury?

Part 7 (continued from earlier response)  Using the model described in Parts 3 through 6, it is understandable that the Spirit of a loving God -- the same Spirit, the same God -- can encourage different people on their different journeys.  It would appear that the sensible approach is to grant the 'other' credit for honesty and humility, and encourage them on their way.  Ordinary hospitality is probably not an issue.  The challenge is dealing with conceptualizations a) that touch on religious truth and b) that are strongly held by people whose world view does not incorporate the first premise.  The Sunnis and the Shias come to mind, but Christianity has its own history of religious war.  But if the model is adopted, then I see much to be gained from dialogue and mutual support.  Certainly, as between you, brother Kevin, myself ad EFC1127A.  Peace and a blessed Easter to all.  P.S.

"The name Donald means: World Ruler, Great Chief, Proud Chief, like Mafia Don. ""Don"" derives from the Italian donno (""Lord"") and the Latin dominus (""Master,"" ""domination"").  The name Trump means: to upstage, to outrank, to triumph ad also has connotations of trickery; ie., ""trumped-up charges.""  His middle name is John, which means ""God is gracious.""  An interpretation of Trump's full name is ""A proud world ruler who, after God has been gracious, will attempt to upstage and outrank Christ, using trumpery and trickery.""  Trump surname is an anglicized version of the German name Drumpf (he is of part Scottish and part German descent). Donald John Drumpf (his full name) in American ASCII computer code is 666. (In Jewish gematria (numerology), the value of the letters in Don Drumpf is 666).  Bible prophecies say the moon will turn to blood before ""the great and terrible day...""

This may be the first time in the 40+ years I've seen your byline at the Times and now ADN that I have agreed with your perspective. Maybe you're having a change of life like the orange cretin himself seemed to when he shunned the GOP majority leaders on Thursday and supported the Democratic Party leaders instead. Maybe next we will see you advocate for fewer subsidies to the oil industry, a state income/sales tax and less knee jerk support for the Republicans who brought us SB21 in the first place ey?

Neither of those were in the USSR now were they ? > even if the USSR achieved some measure of gender equality: was it worth the cost? No... but I certainly never suggested it was. I just think that rationality requires honesty about the facts, to reflexively act as if the USSR had no positive achievements whatsoever and never could have - is to be irrational as they most certainly DID have some, pioneering space travel was another, the AK-47 yet another, whats more, it denies us the opportunity to learn from their successes. Why should we ONLY learn from their failures ?  In the same vein - if one is proposing a better system than capitalism - it would be disingenuous to pretend nothing good came out of it, even if (like me) you feel the amount of terrible outcomes are not at all worth the cost. I would want to replicate the good things that came from it, while avoiding the bad things.  Currently the social democracies appear to have come the closest to doing so.	0

Actually there is a reasonable amount of information on this issue, that has been repeated many times over. I could be wrong but I would assume that the people commenting here also have read the articles. If there are gaps in the information then that would be the government's fault who chose to keep this secret, including the payment . Since the government was the one paying, they could have insisted on full disclosure, The Arar case and similar payment while not the same, had no secrecy about it.	0
"""It is a promise that a man and a woman make to every child, from the moment he or she is conceived in their thoughts.” How well Pope Francis puts it!

Nothing should occupy personal consciousness/ conscience more than awareness that ours is the responsibility to add our increment of understanding to that of the past with special focus on bettering the future of common well-being."	0

When the West had our wars, it was simultaneously looting these same countries in Asia and Africa. Millions of colonized Asians were also conscripted to fight wars for European countries.

One could argue that victims receive a life long sentence so why shouldn't the perps receive longer sentences?  And what sort of punishment should the cover up bishops, and higher ups receive? They fell under the spell of the lawyers and the insurance agents who panicked at least one arch bishop in a certain victorian diocese. In another diocese catholic principals were called to a conference and addressed in such a way that left no doubt about the potential for financial loss to the diocese and the religious orders - no word about the victims in terms of pastoral care simply the protocols for the future to protect the church's wealth.	0
My understanding is that goats are not native to Kodiak and don't really have predators - which may not address the Cubs hat but may shed some light for people that are upset with the actual killing of the goat.  For some people the hat might have been seen as disrespectful, but from what I understand they killed it humanely, and used everything (including hide and bones) which to me is the most important piece that wasn't stated in the story.  I would be truly outraged if someone went out there and shot the goat and either did not use the meat or did not care for the meat and hide appropriately.	0

Parallels exist between Alaska's budget crisis and the similar crisis in the Federal budget. The Administration's proposed cuts in Federal programs (the NEA, Public Radio etc.) resemble calls in Alaska to cut more in State government. Nationally, we have massive debt and annual spending deficits that just continue to grow. Sound familiar? These proposed cuts in the Federal budget amount to peanuts. In Alaska, credible sources estimate that firing every State employee tomorrow would save about 750 million a year. The State would still have a deficit of what, 3 billion? Of course it's fantasy to even consider such a construct - no troopers, no highway maintenance, no public services at all. Get real.  On both the State and federal level, where is the real money that contributes the most to debt and budget deficits? Nationally, that big money is in defense, interest on the debt and entitlement programs. In Alaska, after eliminating State government, where is the big money to pay the 3B?	0
"In England in the Midde-Ages I am given to understand that Religious Order priests e.g.Friars, who looked after the spiritual needs of people through preaching, hearing confessions and spiritual guidance were addressed as Father and secular priests as Mr.  In the Divine Office when asking the Hebdomadarian for a blessing the formula is, 'Jube, Domne, benedicere,"" (Pray Sir, a blessing), not Pater (Father). 'Domne' being a contraction of 'Domine' (Lord) to distinguish it from Our Lord. Some monks and Canons Regular are addressed as Dom and some abbesses and nuns as Dame. Italian priests are often addressed as 'Don'. As the Religious Orders were suppressed at the Reformation all the clergy left were secular and continued to bear the title Rev Mr to this day. French priests are often addressed as M'sieur l'Abbé which derives from the Hebrew or Aramaic for 'father'.  I also understand that deacons in the Eastern Churches are also addressed as Father; in the West it is 'Deacon' or Rev Mr."	0

See, Alaska Supreme Court Allen vs AOGCC and ConocoPhillips 2 Pacific edition 2000!  The state agencies seem to run interference for the majors and run smaller oil and gas competitors out of Alaska and that is why Gov. Palin took on big oil and provided incentives and credits to overcome the Corrupt Bastards Club ( FBI discovered the CBC in the VECO case)!

I do condemn anti Muslim hate and anti-Muslim violence. Now do you condemn Islamic radicals hatred of non-Muslims, and their indiscriminate violence carried out in the name of Islam? Every religion contains extremist bigots, as the literal nature of religion is to preference your own irrational beliefs over those of others. All religions are at their core divisive, and corrosive to global understanding. The more devotional the religious adherent, the more inherently discriminatory they are toward other religions. Criticism of all religions should be encouraged, and not shut down by arguments of divine offense. In Muslim countries there is little tolerance of other beliefs of which the Muslim Canadian community is silent.	0

"I used to do all my shopping at Sobey's in Toronto, but have switched to a Metro nearby.  Here is some free advice to win back customers: 1.  The staff seem surely and disengaged and not just at one store but many.  That tells me something is wrong with the organizational culture  because the fish rots from the head down. 2. Your prices are far too high, full stop.   3.  Please stop the practice of Buy 3 and save or Buy 4 and save.  This marketing gimmick is just that and once I see that I just keep on walking by. 4.  What really drives me crazy, and was the tipping point why I stopped shopping at Sobey's, is when they mark an item on sale rather than just the sale price they put the old price and a fine print that says, ""you may save""  $2.53.  So one never really knows what the sale price is rather you may save this amount which tells me I won't save that amount.  Again you are trying to deceive the customer.

The profundity of your lack of comprehension of the role played by the judiciary, including the SCC, in our Parliamentary democracy is astonishing, but not surprising.  How did the judiciary ascend to the position that you decry?  Don't jump to a quick answer; think about it.  Ready?  The elected governments you extol passed the laws that created the position of the judiciary.  That's right; governments elected by the people did it.  If a sufficient number of people don't like the present situation, the government can change those laws.  Admittedly, that's not easy to do but the mechanism exists.  Apparently, there just isn't enough interest in doing so.	0

Kimi has already killed a  reported 350-some of his own people, why should a few hundreds of thousands of Americans bother him.   And why should China help?

The science shows that with a synthetic oil, oil changes can be done in a range of 12,000-20,000km.  Conventional oils sludge up in approx one-half the mileage driven.

CIVIL controls what speech they will permit.  That is their right because it is their forum to control as they please.  Once any of us are on the sidewalk, however, the only limitations on what we can say are those defined by the Oregon Supreme Court or the US Supreme Court.  That's why some States prohibit nude dancing but in Oregon it is protected by the Oregon Constitution.    SCOTUS doesn't protect it, the Oregon Supreme Court does.

I've waited hours in Queens ER.  Something felt like it was stuck in my throat.  Another patient was bleeding from a head wound.  Still another apparently had the flu and was coughing and sneezing all over the place, infecting everybody in the ER.  Great experience, but there is no other choice.  My regular doctor wasn't available immediately.  Doctors these days really don't take care of their patients.  Its's by appointment only and no same day appointments or even giving you a quicker appointment.	0
It's kind of sad that these folks only wanted to run for Congress if the longtime incumbent didn't want the seat, rather than because they believe they could do a better job. Do people run because they want a job or power, or because they believe they have something great to offer the country, something currently lacking? Yeah I know the answer to that.  Many people believe no one should have an essentially lifetime appointment to Congress, and 12 years, which I believe is Rep Perlmutter's tenure, is often mentioned as a suitable term limit for those who favor them. But here we are, with people backing away from competing, a tradition repeated nationwide as these same folks complain Congress doesn't work and pave the way for the same Congress to stay another 2 years. The current 2 party system is flawed when people are encouraged or praised when they don't compete with the person who has only to say he wants the nomination.	0

But if measuring a man's potential as President was solely based on his ability to make money, then why was Ross Perot not elected? He knew how to make money. He had charts and graphs and non sequitur analogies about all the money we did and could make. What about electing someone like Bill Gates? Jeff Bezos? Dr. Phil? Oprah? They all know how to make money. Let's elect them based SOLELY on this one facet of their character. That's mindset of the typical Drumpf supporter. ""He can make money so I'll vote for him."" Never mind the fact that the guy couldn't debate civics with a 5th grader. Never mind the fact he has no idea on how to avoid a needless military conflict. His solution of any foreign power that disagreed with him would be to press the button and drop the nukes. He's the least qualified (apart from maybe Dr. Carson) be considered for the Presidency."	0

They wouldn't support a modest buffer of 1000ft between recreational marijuana dispensaries that exists still for the few medical marijuana dispensaries. The city manager lied about statistics regarding this and our real estate situation here as well as lying about other cities when he claimed most didn't have the buffer when they do. He lied when he said there wouldn't be more here. Now we have over 100. So every out of state exploiter has come to Eugene and 75% are out of state owned. Even one called Eugreen is completely out of state owned even though they falsely advertise as local in the Eugene Weekly. Alan Zelenkas business partner got him to oppose the buffer to open 2 dispensaries. This all seems hypocritical.  Now we have more dispensaries than large cities like Detroit and SF. We have the same amount as Portland proper almost. Who are these guys kidding? Who gave them money? What real estate companies supported not continuing the previous buffer? Kesey would call them out.	0

"$1200...$1400 My main point (and I am going to get heck for it) is that this sort of ""scary bond redemption  story"" JH is presenting here is not  likely to be as common going forward.

As I mentioned the other day....there is an (eternal) tug of war for investor money....and this ""story"" feels a bit  like financial steering away from corporate bonds imo. ............. ""Dividend investing"" is all the rage these days with rates so low...but I still think corporate bonds (and preferred shares) can do pretty well....or maybe better in some cases....and I hope the Globe discusses them more,and maybe in a better light than this one. Besides yield risk,there is also a huge risk that many dividend equities are overpriced at the moment.... PS ""locking in a $400 capital loss for an overall loss of $11.60........""

I am stunned and saddened by Gabe Rygaard's death.  I got to know Gabe only through the recently completed County Commissioner primary election campaign.  I found him to be a caring and concerned person who was sincerely interested in the welfare of Clallam County.  He wanted to do his part to improve our lives.  The manner in which he conducted his campaign and discussed the issues important to him was exemplary.   Just two days ago Gabe and I had a long, very pleasant and informative lunch together.  I was looking forward to many more discussions with him, and to the logging industry tours that he offered to take me on.  I was also looking forward to discussing with him some day the topic of coaching kids' sports, a passion that he and I both shared.  It is just shocking to suddenly have these possibilities removed.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Katie and his family.  This type of tragedy is so difficult to comprehend.  I wish there was something I could do to ease your pain.	0

It seems to me that this article is about equality and I couldn't agree more we need equality as Canadians we are suppose to have it but sadly nothing could be farther from the truth. Maybe instead of allowing our government to spend billions on foreign aid, and allowing tens of thousands of immigrants into the country that we now have to support we should be taking care of our selves. Let's also consider the constant expense of our lovely first nations people who have far more rights then any of us. I sure would have liked a fat cheque from the government when I turned 18 while constantly getting hand out after hand out.  It's about time the tax payers of Canada stopped worrying about being offensive or hurting every cry babies feelings and started taking care of ourselves and the beautiful country we live in.

At this juncture it is hard to credit the FBI, Obama, the CIA and Homeland Security as any more credible than the man in the Kremlin, mainly because the political leadership in Washington has never been more corrupt.

Saying the Benghazi lie was not intentional is a great example of Politifact parsing it's words and ignoring sources that don't conform to their desired outcome. Random demonstrations don't come with RPG rocket launchers as the attack had. Ambassador Stephens sent dozens of communications begging for more protection outlining the risks and WIKILEAKs gave us Hilary's emails to outsiders acknowledging that it was a terror attack. If you truly want to be unbiased you need to go to the source and not use political intermediary s like snopes or politifact who have been shown to be bias. Like wiki leaks or not they only put out the truth, or what people have said whether true or not, like Assange or not he will gore any ox on either side of the isle without injecting his own interpretation.

The Trumps don't think they did anything wrong because in their world people do whatever it takes to win... and there are no laws, just winners and losers.

Telling you that you are wrong does not meet any known definition of 'shutting down debate'.  You were never prevented from making false statements. But nobody is under any obligation to pretend your unproven and false opinions carry equivalent weight to evidence-based scientiffic research. Nobody even stopped the Koch brothers from funding research to try disprove the theory.

what is the alternative?  repubs, you know exactly what happened at the national level, and our repubs favor and hail this moron for president.  if one cannot recognize that a person is so inept and unsuited, and blindly support him, then it shows that the local repubs are also inept.  two us senators had the guts to tell it like it is about trump, yet the other repubs  in congress are scared to say anything even though many of them are thinking the same things as these two senators.  you think you had it bad with the dems, but you don't realized how bad the repubs are, which is reflected now at the national level.  bush 43 gave us one of the worst recession in years, he fought a stupid and winless war, Obama tried to straighten things out but most of his presidency was fighting the repubs majority in congress who fought him because he is black.  now this white supremacist is trying to undo everything, causing chaos in the country and abroad.  nope, repubs are not the answer.	1
Convenient timing that this rate hike happens at the same time that the liberals are encouraging more first time buyers to enter the market with their interest free loans. Although those loans could certainly be used to achieve the 20%, I'm sure they are very aware this is not the case. We paid the CMHC insurance as we balanced the cost (roughly $13,000 put directly on our mortgage) against the odds that our property would appreciate an equivalent amount in the same time period or less that it would take us to save enough for 20% down. As it turns out it was the right decision, but not one made easily.	0

I don't get it. I basically marked a comment as civil but the Globe & Mail disagreed but didn't explain why. Now the Globe & Mail  has restricted my comments and won't allow me make comments on certain topics for 30 days.  I still can't figure out why the comment I approved wasn't civil. It seemed civil to me.  Why doesn't the Globe & Mail indicate the reason someone is being restricted and point out the reason the Globe & Mail thinks a comment isn't civil if someone else thinks a comment is civil?  Why doesn't the Globe & Mail give someone a warning and a chance to change?  If this keeps up, I just won't read the Globe & Mail anymore and its advertisers won't get my business.  And, if my comments are civil, why does the Globe & Mail restrict my comments because it thinks someone else's comments aren't civil?	0

(Part 6)  You also mentioned Baptism and the Immaculate Conception as threatened by modern science. I agree that baptism understood as washing away an indelible stain inherited from Adam and Eve via sexual intercourse, as postulated by Augustine, makes no sense whatsoever given the development of the doctrines of the Fall and Original Sin I am suggesting. But that is not the only understanding of Baptism we have inherited. The East, in particular, has preserved other understandings, above all our incorporation into the new life introduced into the cosmos by the Christ Event. (Recall, that the East was not straddled with Augustine and his conception of Original Sin, and yet they prize Baptism. Obviously, therefore, our Tradition contains alternative conception of Baptism that the West has tended to down play.)  As for the Immaculate Conception, at the present time I am at a complete loss to make any sense of this particular doctrine.  May I ask why you dropped Jesuitical?  (END)	0

"At times this feels more and more to me that the hierarchy, and obviously many in our society, on some level don't really believe the male of our species knows how to love, or that shared physical intimacy can be an amazing, enriching expression of love.  They go straight to sex, as though that's all there is in the physical act, and see it as mere lust at its core.  Is there a subconscious conviction that sex is a power thing, that it has to be a thing between unequals, meant to be the power of male over female?   The ancient Greeks and Romans certainly differentiated between ""active"" (penetrating, dominant, demanding) and ""passive"" (penetrated, submissive, willing or unwilling) participants.  That mentality seems to continue.  Is it that some are too uncomfortable with the thought of men as ""less than"" dominant to believe sex between men can be an expression of love?"	0

Whenever they ship in the real stuff made in Japan, you pay a higher price but get it a little stale.  But at least it's easier to tell because there's more Japanese writing on the label.	0

Not defending OHA here, but this article has a ton of inaccuracies. For starters, free speech doesn't apply at meetings. Otherwise the presiding officer would never be able to remove chanting protesters or people that booed testifiers, etc. You are not allowed to question board members, OIP has ruled on that. You only have the right to submit testimony. You also have to keep your testimony related to the topic on the agenda, unless you have an agenda item that allows for public input on items not listed elsewhere on the agenda. The democratic party is a private organization that can set it own rules. The one consent law just means you cannot be arrested for recording it, but it does not prevent someone in charge from banning audio recording and expelling those that wont abide by the rule.	0

When a horrible disaster occurs it's human nature to lash out in grief and anger, looking for someone to punish.

It might be right to find someone negligent after due investigation, always bearing in mind the danger of hindsight bias.  But the first response should be to try and find ways to improve rather than ways to blame and retaliate .	0
Nevertheless, it was a crime back then to carry a revolver in the glove compartment. Remember? It's even against the law to carry a revolver in the glove compartment today without a permit. BTW: My best friend had a pickup with a gun rack, and we'd use it for transporting our shotguns when we went bird hunting. (We were just country boys from northern Ohio.) While in the rack, we always left the chamber open just to make sure one of us had not inadvertently forgotten to unload. We wanted to make sure not to commit one of those irresponsible acts like carrying a loaded firearm around. My dad taught me to do that and even to disassemble (AKA, remove) the barrel from our shotguns when in our car and keep them in the trunk while transporting them. It was easy to do and took only about 20 seconds with a Wingmaster. My dad and the NRA taught me that you can't be TOO safe.  Best,  RTD	0

"""The Gospel tells us that Christ gave his life for us and has entrusted us with his mission.

Com-Munion & Com-Munity , as 'mission' must be regional, that is, authentic, biologically (ecologically) and 'religiously' in the regional context. What and who is 'com-munity'? A member of a com-munity can be rightly understood as a 'com-munitiest', which can politically be corrupted to ""communist"", in a top-down, politically controlled sense. To be authentic, original and true meanings of words are critical to maintain authentic meaning of purpose in application -- and so it is with the abused word ""community"".

That's ridiculous; plenty of people buy the car and then obtain the insurance.  I've purchased a car and then added insurance right at the dealership.  My mom on the other hand always purchased her insurance after she bought the car usually a day later.  She wasn't very high tech so everything she did was slower, like mailing in checks rather than using cards over a phone.  It's not that abnormal.  Often times the majority of people driving without insurance had it to begin with and then it lapsed and they stopped making payments.   But that's just my observations. And that's why those of us who have insurance have uninsured motorist in our policies.  The true problem lies with people who are willing to drink and drive in this situation and the inebriated people who chose to get in the car with them.   If they were refused service it's too bad the clerk didn't call APD when they drove away.	0

footy, I agree that it's not the majority but there is no doubt that offshore buyers are having a significant impact in some markets.  For example, here in SE Oakville, properties sell within days at significant premiums to asking prices - asking prices frequently end in an 8 - virtually all properties for sale have a realtor of Chinese ethnicity - and, directly from the horses mouth (a local realtor) over 25% of transactions are now done to Chinese purchasers. Further evidence is that houses are sold and then immediately put up for lease - this never used to happen in this area.  I'm not debating whether it's a good or bad thing but rather just making the point that foreign money is having a noticeable impact on the market.	0

The important element to note in this article is that on several occasions the perpetrator apologized for his actions and admitted to having problems over controlling anti-social impulses. However, no where in the article is there a reference to the offender voluntarily seeking professional help in managing these impulses. This would lead this writer to conclude the apologies where not sincere and merely another element of grooming the victims in order to internally justifying their behaviour. There is a sense of re-victimization in that kind of apology as it allows the offender to relive the act over and over. Therapy for sex offenders is complex, but legitimate remorse would involve a real effort at changing the behaviour which does not seem to have happened based on the content of the article.	0

"Distributing ""benefits"" equally you say - although it is much too late, the state certainly had enough money to install in all of rural Alaska water & sewer services and all the basic human services taken for granted in urban Alaska.  But no - the state went ahead and built billions upon billions of dollars of things that are not basic human services, in urban Alaska.  Then the state only hired in urban Alaska, paid them very well, and never made an attempt to hire people from rural Alaska, well they hired mostly non-Natives who live out here. I say split Alaska in half, say from below Bethel to just west of Fairbanks - if you ask me, well you did ask me."	0

If you think Donald Trump is a champion of simple living and neighbourly support, you should think twice.  The globalization that took away heartland jobs was the doing of corporations -- Trump's biggest pals -- and there's no way he has the power or the will to reverse it.

"""Maybe Kepler today has told us indirectly, although we need confirmation, that we are probably not alone"" Not convinced. The occurrence of life on earth has yet to be completely deterministically linked to the environmental factors in which it arose. So concluding that it would arise when you have the same factors seems premature. * Models that attempt to get around this through the use of randomness say that what we have may be indeed unbelievably rare, but it is what it is. This does not necessarily carry over to a different occurrence of the same conditions whose very rare random outcome could be something else."	0
BS. People knew exactly what was going on and understood the objectives to be the elimination of the 'Indian problem'. There were numerous reports by qualified doctors, health inspectors, teachers, policemen, various civil servants and even clergymen about the horrendous health conditions, forced starvation, physical abuse and criminal behaviour that was rampant in the residential schools. Complaints were ignored and those who made them were frequently fired from their jobs and blacklisted in their professions for having reported the abuse.   A prominent example is government medical inspector P.H. Bryce who in 1907 reported that 24 percent of previously healthy Aboriginal children across Canada were dying in residential schools. This figure does not include children who died at home, where they were frequently sent when critically ill. Bryce reported that anywhere from 47 percent to 75 percent of students discharged from residential schools died shortly after returning home.	0

If people who are not native appreciate native artwork and are inspired to create their own art which adopts some aspects of the native art, it makes it possible for more people, native and otherwise, to see it and appreciate it - and they may also be drawn to look for original native art.  If we want the traditional native culture to survive, is this not a good thing?	0

"Measure 97 will be great for small Oregon businesses.  It will bring billions more dollars into the state economy and increase economic activity around 3% - more than enough to make up for any small increases in the cost of goods for small businesses, which will be at a competitive advantage over the large, multistate retailers who will be actually paying the GRT.  Most importantly, however, it will enable the state to fund education adequately, rather than providing school kids with the shortest school year and largest class sizes in the country.  Mr. Morris' diatribe against the public sector is just the standard Tea Party line put forward by people who don't subscribe to the idea of government ""of, by, for the people"" and think we should all be left alone behind our individual walls.

FREEMAN TAKE ADVANTAGE  OF TRUMP CONFUSION TO ADVANCE HER PERSONAL AGENDA AND CAREER. WATCH OUT!  It's no secret the Freeman is a Russia hater, a Ukraine lover. Russia - 25 years of stable democracy now in world leadership role, admired by many, defeated Islamic State in Syria, strategic partner of China. Ukraine - 20 years of upheaval, civil war, economic bankruptcy, coup and Neo-Nazism. Lost Crimea because that autonomous region voted to split due to illegal coup to topple the president it voted in.   Into this Freeman picks side. Nobody in Canada urge her to do so.   Freeman suggest Canada rearm. Is she going to restart America's Cold War 2 on Russia now that Trump admit it's a stupid lost cause? Yes, Canada will lead the way in a new Cold War to defeat Russia!! Out American stupidity, in Trudeau's hand-picked stupidity.   It is shocking Trudeau allows Freeman to turn Canadian foreign policy into a tool of her personal ambition, her personal vendetta. Get rid of this nonsense.	1
Agreed up to a point, Pres. Trump's administration must be answerable for any illegal actions with regard to collusion with Russians or any foreign nationals. .

(part 13) When they told me it wasn’t my ACL, I was thankful. You have to be. Once you go through an ACL tear—or two in my case—and you find out it’s just the meniscus, there’s some relief there. When you go through the process with the ACL, that really gives you some things to think about. A meniscus is minor in comparison. People have played through it, and guys tolerate that. My body wasn’t adapting to it, but that’s ok. I was thankful my ACL was still intact because it meant there was still a chance for me.  That’s more powerful than anything in the world.  The rest of the article is a really good read:  http://www.jamaalcharles25.com/2017/01/09/the-here-and-now/  I expect jamaal Charles to be the free signing of the year, he has essentially not played football for two years, so he is fresh and has a chip on his shoulder!!!

"Pro life does not necessarily mean conservative.   Conservatives are open to change but slow considerate change.  When ""pro-life Christians"" make outlandish claims that they know when ensoulment and when personhood begins, they can not be considered conservatives.  They can be considered anti science and mindless sheep. They are idolaters.  When ""pro live catholics"" do not take care of babies and people after birth, they are not at all pro life.  When pro - life catholics declare that the BC pill causes abortions, they do not even understand the definition of abortion.  So lets get over the idea that pro life people are conservatives.  Conservatives believe in preserving the environment so that we do not self destruct.  The more conservatives understand that things must change, the more they understand that they must be considerate progressives themselves.  I see very few self describes conservatives on this board that are non other than thoughtless reactionaries."	0

I happen to be one.   And where do you get the idea most people against smoking are shills for the oil and gas industry? How does one relate to the other and what is your source for that assertion? Or that they all hate hemp? Where is your evidence that people who want to regulate outdoor smoking are all folks who don't know the difference between industrial hemp and marijuana?	0

I'd bet that nobody wants to pay more than - make that nobody really enjoys paying any tax. The Trump issue is that he is obviously stratospherically wealthy and pays no taxes. He had what? $6500 in taxable income? Of course he claimed every deduction available - interest, materials, depreciation, legal costs, business trips on his private jet, maintenance of his private jet. He probably had no charitable contributions to deduct. Trump uses roads and airports, public safety services and other benefits that we pay for. Trump et al are a great reason to restructure tax laws. I doubt that the 1% are up for that.	0

If homo sapiens ('wise men' -- misnamed I'll say) ever did set foot on another planet, they would trash it just like they trashed this one. I'm thinking about the huge vortex of trash in the Pacific Ocean. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is twice the size of the continental US, between California and Hawaii (per Google). Also, after global warming bakes the earth, maybe we should pick a new name for our species. Can the men who have carelessly contaminated other bodies in our Solar System properly be called 'wise men'? Anyone who cannot appreciate all the myriad sentient species on this Planet will also be pathetically clueless about life on any other planet and cause extinctions. If there is life out there, I hope they quarantine us sapiens. Seriously! We have to classify our mutant-selves as a planetary disease. And for all we know, we are already quarantined by some extra-terrestrials with the intelligence we lack, and who have mercifully decided to keep us as objects of curiosity.	1
"Junk Science so-called, ""Wild Salmon"". Are the hatchery and wild fish genetically different? NO!  If the hatcheries did not cut off the adipose fin no one would know the difference between wild and hatchery salmon. In fact, hatcheries could by-pass cutting fins on thousands of hatchery salmon and BOOM! Now they are ""wild salmon""! Fish & Wildlife claim that currently, 80% of the approximately one million returning adult Columbia River salmon and steelhead are hatchery-reared. The remaining 20% are naturally produced in streams. (so they say)  So... Take all that tax money being spent trying to save that alleged 20% (so called) wild salmon and dramatically increase hatcheries, and hatchery production, because hatchery and wild fish are genetically the same.

They choose vulgar Latin, and it is that form of Latin that was preserved in the Latin liturgy.

Hi Monica, I've NO problem with folks who think differently from me having a place in the church.  I strongly suggest that to the degree Jesus even envisioned a church, that would be exactly what we likely intended, else he would have sought out only like-minded people.  Typically my problem with that group is that they seem to be fine with their views, and want everybody else to either change to their views, or ultimately leave.     I do believe that those 'grey areas' I described as being where most life is actually lived, plays well with your point.  To understand the lives of people, and to minister to them well, you have to see them and their lives as the people themselves see things.  That would seem to be a prerequisite to then roll up one's sleeves, and start to work for change.  And all of this circles back to your main point: that kind of binary thinking by those at the top serves as almost a natural barrier to the effectiveness of the church in so many ways.	0

The info doesn't impact their belief system even if they digest every morsel of it. For many women, such gender generalization isn't a threat in the first place. Maybe it's trust in one's own personal ability to defy stereotypes, and maybe it's that many women don't identify with the mass ""woman"" demographic as much as they identify with other, more specific demographics. Increasingly, kids attend coed schools and play on coed sports teams throughout their formative years. ""Sister solidarity"" never happens for many at all. More than identifying themselves by their gender, young girls first define themselves by socioeconomic status, race, popularity, attractiveness, intelligence, etc. I'm sad to hear Young Denby was heckled by chauvinist jerks. For many young girls, though, other women are more the enemy than men."	0
Actually, Hitler was not a vegetarian. And what if, contrary to fact, he were? The Nazis also strongly favored marriage. Does that mean marriage is an inherently immoral institution? The Nazis also believed that sports were essential to the development of strong character. Does this mean that competitive sports are inherently immoral? Jesus Christ preached a gospel of sharing resources on an equitable basis. Gandhi promoted a similar message, as did Stalin. But Stalin also devalued human beings. Can we conclude that the idea of more equitable resource distribution has some inherent moral flaw that taints Jesus or Gandhi? No, of course not.   Gary L. Francione Professor, Rutgers University	0
"As a fair minded Canadian citizen it is obvious that the victims of these crimes should  be fully compensated for due process and justice denied. $10 million each sounds like a good number. The accused is innocent until proven guilty so for time spent in jail an additional allotment of a million or so seems fair. Make sure lawyers on both sides get 30% of the ""winnings"" in compensation for wasted effort. Let the average Canadian who had nothing to do with any of this pay for everything as the whole mess has been  done for their benefit. That is only fair."	0

"PHILCO3: I'm not surprised that job applicants with foreign names don't get call backs at the same rate as those with European names. (The term ""WASP"" is actually quite irrelevant in the Canadian context. I was born and raised here and even though an Anglophone don't have a WASP surname, which was never a disadvantage as far as I could ascertain.) During my working years, I sat on a few hiring committees and the two things that impacted consideration of immigrant applicants arose from concerns about English language skills and educational equivalency. The first issue is logically self-explanatory while the latter is relevant because it's often difficult for employers to assess the actual qualifications of applicants who are educated and/or trained outside of Canada. Neither issue ever stopped an organization with which I was affiliated from considering immigrant applicants, but even if only subconsciously these differences probably do generate barriers. It's human nature."	0
"(This keeps getting deleted as ""uncivil"" because it makes some of you uncomfortable? You're misusing the ratings system..) Frederick, what Paul wrote is as much a part of the Bible as the rest of it, Old and New Testament, and doesn't disagree with any of it when you understand it all as a coordinated whole. Jesus clearly did not teach that we are saved by following the law (Google ""Matthew 5:18 commentary"" if that's one verse you're getting at, https://www.gci.org/bible/matthew517 for example); we get right with God, forgiven, through faith in Christ's finished work on the cross that paid the price for our sins, but, genuine saving faith will have as part of it a conviction of the ugliness of our sin and the need to turn away from it - repentance (required by God; you can't ask for forgiveness and then continue doing those very same things), and Christ's lordship, without which we can't live a life pleasing to God. A right heart with God also will result in an outflow of good works."	0
>. The second allows domestic producers to increase prices Nevermind then, that domestic producers haven't raised prices, in fact they are working on utterly razor thin margins - at least that's what they claim whenever anybody suggests they should pay their workers enough money to eat properly. The prices have gone up in stores, but they haven't gone up at the farm gate though, this much is pretty easy to verify.  So the stores may be benefiting from the ability to raise the price on domestic goods due to imported goods being made more expensive by the weakened rand -but those are the very same people you just denied are profiteering.	0

Sampling is all that we have at the moment which is why I take the time to analyze as many different sources as possible. Which is all that we can do. Granted, there are a handful of RINOs who are upset that under Trump they won't get to exploit the labor of illegal immigrants or improve their stock portfolio by firing American factory workers and sending their jobs overseas. But that is a dwindling population of the new GOP which has grown to become a party that really does represent the working class. This is opposed to the Democrats who are eating each other alive. Looking at the city's other Alternative newspaper, for one example, it still seems like there is incessant, internecine bickering going on between backers of the two major Democratic candidates. This is coupled by the refusal of Democrats to understand why they lost in not only key swing states last November, but in states like Wisconsin and Michigan which haven't voted Republican in decades.	0

"The judge told the officer he recalled passing the bicyclist on Willamette.

In excess of 30 miles per hour? Perhaps with his head down until just before impact?  The third witness probably had it right.

Todd, thanks for weighing in.  We're all pretty sensitive to tax increases these days, to be sure.  However, to clarify your comment, the tax that was rejected was a bond to build a new high school.  The levy that ran at the same time in 2015 passed strongly, with almost 65% voter approval.  This levy is simply a renewal of that one, and is neither a new tax nor a 39% hike; mathematically it will cause little, if any, increase to what folks pay now.  It's not a new tax.  The levy funds are 22% of the district's budget, and this number is not being increased.  The levy pays for shop and vocational programs, athletics, counselors, smaller class sizes, much of our amazing music program, and a large portion of maintenance.  To lose it would be a major blow to our economy and our ability to recruit both new businesses and good teachers.  Our business and medical community are urgently asking the community to renew it.	0

I can see why Tory says give them the money, its a pure dollars and cents move; Pride brings in a lot of money in the way of tourism dollars. But the city should play hardball with BLM/Pride,  this should not be a consequences- free grant and should come with very specific conditions on how this money should be used. BLM's antics are going to drive away (mostly white) tourists and sponsorship money. BLM/Pride should be billed  for Private Security, the way any similar event would be. They can hire off-duty cops at their high rates. I don't think the Mayor of Chief of Police should attend to send a strong message.  What I *really* don't get is how the Gay community could roll over so easily and how easily BLM's rhetoric was swallowed. The black community has a long and on-going animosity towards gay men. It's not Gay men that target black men, its the other way around. BLM saw a soft target and a chance to further victimize gay men and went for  the jugular.	0

The middle class is not poor.  And it's not the working class, either.  The middle class is comprised of business executives, successful small and medium sized business owners, successful artists, professionals,  entertainers, the mainstream commentariat, the clergy and last, but not least; academics.  They defend capitalism and manage it for capitalists, entertain the plebes and pump out the ideological bilge that keeps everyone distracted and in their place.  Young Trudeau wasn't kidding.

"I'm not expecting different results. I understand that they system isn't tailored to meet my needs alone. I vote for the best candidate in the primary and the one that belongs to me party in the election. And on the margin things improve. But certain people that push this ""3rd party"" nonsense. OR others that vote ""for the best person"" cause politics to bounce back and forth and never move in one direction or the other. So these two parties can easily sway the middle. someone that fully understands their political beliefs should NEVER vote for the other party.  And NO I asked you first. You have yet to answer.

Except that few are qualified, by any standards. Choosing between two will be difficult.  On hiring committees we look at 'blind studies', CVs and often one person stands out, usually like a nova in the sky.  We don't choose one, they choose us and we reflect that.  Then Faculty politics and Family problems enter the issue about coming to our school, or leaving their old and very snug school.  Or the family doesn't want to leave, start all over again, etc. etc. The big bug-bear is a temptation to hire within, our favourite grad student, or promoting a colleague.   Grad students really should go away to another school for a while,  They will keep in touch and still apply with a wider experience. Some will want to stay in Canada for political and citizenship reasons. Colleagues are safe.  But they have been here for 10 years and their career is going to slow down for the next 20 years.  Many vexatious problems in hiring.	0

"Re: Trump as some kind of Russian plant, or traitor, or whatever...  It is said Trump ""colluded"" with Russia. What does this mean, exactly?

Except Trump also won where no computers are used for balloting. Nope. Did Putin give Trump unknown campaign funds? Trump won while expending about a third of what Clinton did...nope.

"With all due respect DougN, Justice Scalia's opinions relating to the American Arbitration Act seem to demonstrate his pro-corporate bias and radical judicial activism. For example, he basically read into the AAA, a view that the originally narrow statute (originally written to only apply to union arbitration) now trumps most statutes passed by both state and federal legislatures intending to give people their day in court.  Many knowledgable people now say his opinions on the AAA have pretty much slammed the door on employee and consumer access to the courts.  In my personal view, Justice Scalia was a radical activist judge.  Not saying that's a bad thing, but please, let's call a spade a spade.  As nice as it sounds, he was NOT a pure Constitutional originalist.  He was a conservative activist judge who acted like a ""quasi-legislator,"" at least in some cases."	0

"God made us to be integral, coherent among our ""faculties,"":  our intellect (which includes our conscience - conscience is an 'act' of the intellect), our will, our appetites, our bodies.  He made us for ""unity"", principally with Him.  So in order to be healthy, happy, and stable we must maintain a level of unity among these faculties.  If there are fissures, contradictions, etc then there is an ""unsettling"" in us.  Over time various mental issues can begin to develop.   If our will departs from God's will (the Creator who designed us and breathed life into us), then there is a fissure between us and God.  Not good.  If our will departs from our intellect (e.g., we do things we know not to be good and true) then there is an interior fissure (plus a fissure with God, Whose will we are required to rectify to).  And I could go on, but this is why many mental problems develop, aside from a lesser number of true biochemical issues.   This is what Our Lord meant when He spoke about ""peace""."	0

"Trudeau made a big mistake in not setting up a carbon tax, and then making allowances for provincial actions on the carbon front. Instead, he tried to make the provinces do his dirty work in the name of ""provincial choice"". Had Trudeau set up a federal carbon tax, it could be waived if the provincial system was less than or equal to the federal tax, but the federal tax would kick in when the provincial system dropped to less than the federal tax.  In the Manitoba case, the federal carbon tax would be zero until the target tax became $30, when the federal government would collect the $5 difference in taxes."	0

PLEASE stop comparing us to the USA. The USA is rated 27th in the developed world. We are not much better, being rated 24th.  Congratulating ourselves that we are better than the Americans is a lazy, useless exercise.  In the 1970s we did indeed have a health service we could be proud of. A family physician could phone the specialist of his choice, have his patient seen the same day for an emergency and within a week for anything elective, and all operations would be performed within weeks, whether elective or not. This showed that the system can run without waiting lists. Decades of underfunding and rationing of beds, operating rooms, and investigative resources have left us with one of the longest waiting lists in the world. Spare me the self-congratulatory comparisons with one of the worst health care systems. When journalists start comparing us to France, Germany, Sweden or any of the 23 countries who are better than us I will know that they are seriously considering reform.	0

Agree! Wish we had another newspaper to choose from.  Apparently  it’s the only way we might be offered two differing and unbiased points of view on the same topic.

Currently it takes it’s other news sources to learn we’re some of the highest taxed individuals in any state, our state pension plan is going broke, our roads are linked more closely to those of a third world country or our student education scores, school facilities and upkeep rank near last.

"Under  29 U.S.C. § 141-197 of 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act, the president can impose an 80 day cooling-off period prior to a contract expiring.

Presidents since Truman have been rather reluctant to invoke the provisions of the Act."	0

"And one province over Manitoba has the cheapest Hydro rates in North America.  Why? Because their people boot out governments that lie. Greg Selinger told the population of the province he wouldn't raise the PST. He lied. Result ""Booted Out"" next election. In Ontario McGuinty continually lied about not raising taxes and brought in the Health Care Premium, then the gas Plants etc. and the population keeps a voting Liberal even with Wynn. Now how it is connected to Hydro? As the population of one province would, as seen, boot out a government that screwed them financially. Manitoba has over capcity in generating capacity as it's people demand it. Whereas Ontario keeps voting the Liberals in, again, and again, and again so they let Ontario Hydro go down the sewer because they can get away with it.

I predict that land fills will one day be worth their weight in gold. I base this prediction on the idea that raw material shortages and improved technology will lead to mineing land fills for profit. Rather than force recycling before technology catches up land fill operator's should consider their operation as not disposal but as a storage system for future raw material. I have no doubt that in the near future companies will be flocking to get control of the resources stored in land fills as technology improves.	0
Are students allowed to use mechanical aids when they do the provincial maths assessment test in Grades 3, 6 and 10? If not, why not? When I did maths (arithmetic it was called then) 70 years ago, there were no mechanical aids. It was all fingers and memory work. People who worked behind the counter in a grocery store had to do all the calculations for purchases in their head. Now, cash registers do it in a fraction of the time. The important thing is to know how to use a cash register, not how to multiply 7x9 and get 63 using just your memory. Maybe, if computer use was allowed, the test results would vastly improve. That's why more emphasis should be placed on understanding the functions of mathematics rather than bringing back boring repetitious drills and memory work made obsolete in real life by faster and more efficient mechanical aids.	0

"1. They are not protesting the flag, the military, or America. They are protesting police brutality. Why is it assumed that they are doing it out of disrespect, or are somehow unpatriotic?   2. ""The left"" would mean anything left of center? Your broad strokes to try and lump your average Hillary voter with Antifa is a non starter. No more so than I can call you a member of the KKK.   3. Taking a knee is not the same as protesting a wedding. They aren't intruding on anything. They're silently showing their desire for change, out of a love for their country. You say the flag represents the right to protest, so why is it unpatriotic to do it during the national anthem? I really don't get that. You seem more hung up on the symbolism than the practice? Is it more important to go through the motions than it is to exercise your rights?  We should be trying to understand each other, instead of assuming the other has malicious intent.

"I want to shake this man's hand, too.  Not that I agree with everything he says.  But I admire a man with principle who makes decisions that, on the face of it, look like a sure way to get removed from office.  By standing tall and taking a stand (even an unpopular one), he's proven to me that he puts the good of the state (us) ahead of his (now uncertain) political career.    Of course, career politicians tremble when asked to make unpopular decisions.  Will any of our legislators dare to stand with the governor and sustain the veto?  Highly unlikely; however, it will be clearer than ever that our do-nothing Legislature appears to care more about being re-elected, than it does about solving our fiscal problems.    Even if the Legislature (into second overtime ... at what cost?) does override the Governor's veto, what will they replace it with?  Any alternatives?  It's far easier to say ""no"" than it is to come up with a game plan.  Meet the governor's challenge, legislators!"	0

Despite being okay with Gus Van Harten’s official complaint asking for reprimand for showing partisanship in the courtroom seemed reasonable, I am suspicious of Harten’s intentions. Especially since he previously asked for Justice Zabel not to reside over any race related cases. In a previous article, Harten brought up a case where Justice Zabel rejected a request to label an assault as race related. Justice Zabel still gave a good sentence and the case was not appealed. An extreme low ball of the judgments and sentences passed during Justice Zabel’s 25-year career I give as 8000. One in 8000 does not seem like a cause for concern to me. Doing Google searches myself, it’s reasonable to assume that Gus Van Harten ignored a whole lot of cases that showed Justice Zabel in a more positive light, to make sure he got quoted. Hamilton lawyers gave their viewpoints to a Spectator journalist on Justice Zabel that did not get published since it did not support the negative rhetoric of the paper.	0

Well, these answers aren't the whole story. Our District followed everything EXACTLY as instructed, verified by HCPF and the new MCD vendor, and many of our claims have not paid in 4 months. When we called,it was a 3 hour wait then they hung up, but now, we seem to get through in 10 to 15 minutes. However, nobody we speak with has any idea why our claims are denied!? They just take our complaint info and nothing resolves. Some denials are related to patients' past diagnosis relating to behavioral health, but the current claim has nothing to do with those and is medical. Ex: A claim for a patient with an anxiety dx gets denied for visiting a medical clinic for hand injury.   We have spoken with numerous people, and no one seems to know how to fix many of our denial issues. That is NOT provider issues relating to application, validation, etc, etc. Also, most of our Part A's are now paying, but after nearly 4 months, NONE of our Part B's are. (?)And no one knows why???	0

I make the joke. To tell the truth, the erotic effect of boobs is probably greater when they are only partially revealed, and their partial revelation has long been a principal art of female fashion. If the organizers of this event really wanted to challenge conventional mores, everyone would wear loose tops with two tiny strategic holes exposing only the nipples. It would probably cause more of an uproar than full nudity. If they wanted to go the whole nine yards, they could also wear capacious pants with places cut away for the naughty bits. But really, why bother? The young women in my town, especially since the craze for yoga pants, manage to leave little to the imagination while remaining fully dressed. I'd say the revolution has already happened.	0
As if Hillary is stupid enough to pick Sanders as her running mate. She'd be smart and calculating to allow people to think that she'd do something that stupid (her (fake) nod to the latest avatar of American populism). Sanders and his supporters have shown their true colors--really they're Trump's little helpers and their insight into the American political scene is about 20/200 or worse, so I hope she makes a wiser choice and seeks to capture the political center with a VP that could appeal to the American mainstream. The Republicans are so psycho-politically unstable there's no reason the Democrats should not own the political center.	0
"""After all- he basically had to win the election - no choice really- to get the IRS and other legal problems off his back.

Winning the election would not get the IRS off his back, unless you are alleging corruption within the IRS with no basis whatsoever.   2. He did not 'stiff' investors, his business was insolvent and came under bankruptcy laws.    3.  There is no information anywhere about how long the business losses covered gains for.

"""all other democracies rely on the popular vote?"" Wrong, and insults don't help make your case. I just gave you an example, us, Canada. Another is Australia.   The US does have a unique system. But it is a federation of states. The electoral college is just one way of taking into account regional representation, not the only one. Particularly in large countries, and federated ones, like Canada and the US, there is a need to ensure regional representation.  You did not answer the core of my argument, apparently that's too difficult? But It seems you and others object to the very concept of federations, and constitutional checks and balances to ensure regional representation in choosing the leader of the country."	0
Christy, in my work with F&G in the past, I assisted with a lot of direct hands on salmon research. I don't know where you fish kings, but I can tell you that, with the exception of the Kenai in river salmon fishery, the state is doing a great job of protecting salmon resources. There are dozens of factors that affect salmon, they all react differently to subtle variations in temp., water clarity, ph, sediment accumulation, vegetation growth, sunlight on riparian areas, variation in abundance of water at certain times of the year...not to mention ocean conditions. Lots of variables. Bottom line is that they need clean water to spawn in. Period. If they have that, they stand the best chance of dealing with other changing conditions out there. Pebble threatens this indefinitely.	0

I'm just wondering, if this have to do with racism and nothing else, why is severely limiting immigration from Europe not viewed as racist also? It is a noticeable pattern that those who cry racism on every issue appears to be more racist that the people they accuse it with because that's all they see and not the individuals. It's the 21st century, accusations of racism should only be used when appropriate, otherwise it dilutes the credibility it should have on valid claims.	0
We have weak opposition parties to the tax and spend liberals in Ottawa. We should all welcome the possibility of changes being forced by the Trump election.

If you aren't a global power and have no territorial ambitions there are three primary reasons to spend on military in my mind:  Domestic defense, subsidization of military industries, and international diplomacy.  Canadians have spoken loudly that they aren't interested in military economic sectors and Canada already has one of the highest reputations in the world.  That only really leaves domestic defense as an area where we could get any value out of increased military spending.  I feel we should actually increase spending on domestic defense.  Defending and exerting control over a geographic area as big as Canada is a tall order in itself given our small population.  However, we can't rely on the isolation of our land-masses forever.  The world is getting warmer and more crowded with each passing year.	0

Just because one judge ruled the lease illegal , doesn't mean the state isn't libel for the agreement they made . Judges decisions get reversed every day in America .   While the owners would be hard pressed to find 12 sympathetic jurors in Anchorage , they did act in good faith and gave the states reps the top quality building they asked for.  Just because the people have buyers remorse , my bet is the state will have to pay for the special order building they asked for.  Walker better set aside 37 million of Alaskan's PFD checks to pay for this building . In fact , the state may end up with this building AND the Wells Fargo building . That will give us the room to move the capital to Anchorage.	0

Donald J. Trump is proving he's little more than a naive idiot and a schoolyard bully. Contrast Japan with China:. Shinzo Abe arrived a couple of days after the election to kiss the ring of the capitalist imperial emperor. Xi Jinping won't be bowing to Trump. We can be certain that China will call his bluff. The US is headed for significant inflation within the context of tariff loving protectionism. Do we really need to listen to this mouthpiece for the next four years? The only real consolation is it's certain he's destined to be a lame duck president. No US president has been this brash since at least Lyndon Johnson and  even at that Johnson was a state diplomat when compared to Trump...big ego, huge mouth, and small hands.	1
Yes, it works in some areas. Our church puts out bulky items the day or two before the scheduled pick up and we get some people who go around the day before and pick things that they want to recycle. The crew in our area is great. Many of the crew live in the area and are familiar with the residents. This probably helps with the timeliness of the pick ups. Then we get the ones who want to dispose by themselves. It's a good thing but when they run into a closed drop off site, they just go down the road and dump it on the side of the road. Some just don't know of the time facilities are open or just don't care.	0

For several years after retiring from teaching, I worked as a field representative for the U.S. Census bureau, visiting a representative sample of addresses to collect data about whomever lived there.  I visited numerous care homes, especially in Pearl City and Waipahu, where nearly all of the care homes were owned by Filipino families.  I had only the address; so my first visit was always unannounced.  Most of the homeowners were friendly and cooperative, but it was surprising how many were hostile or afraid of me -- not because I'm nasty, haole, or have a beard, but because they feared I might be an undercover inspector for the Dept. of Health.  Why were they suspicious and afraid of an unannounced inspection?  Either because they were unlicensed, operating illegally; or because they were providing substandard care.  Most seemed OK to me; I'd be willing to live there.  But the state must improve licensing, inspections, and public reporting of results.	0

In the near future, alcohol is going to be demonized by the reality that it destroys your health through destroying your gut and intestinal bacteria. Recent studies have shown that 5 shots of alcohol in healthy males negatively affected their health. This is determined by blood samples taken every 30 minutes for four hours after and again 24 hours later. The study shows that the alcohol binge resulted in increased gut permeability (leaky gut) and elevations of endotoxin levels. That was one event of drinking.

Our jails are already crowded with nonviolent offenders - why add two more?  I'd rather reserve apartments in those institutions for the individuals most likely to endanger someone in the future. Neither has a criminal record, and neither are likely to face charges in the future regardless of this trial's outcome. Even if convicted, the sentences would surely be short.  They'd return to their obviously comfortable lifestyle (business interests, home, motor home, weekend property, etc.) after a few months, hardly worse for the wear.    This is a crime of negligence (no intent to damage property) and privilege (burn rules apply to others, not us), exacerbated by panic (leave quickly before we get caught). A very  (VERY!) hefty fine and very (VERY!) lengthy community service would serve as deterrents to this type of behavior, while saving us the expense of housing and feeding them.	0

I think one likely outcome of this tragedy will be a National CCW Reciprocity Law,  allowing CCW holders from any State in the US to carry in any state that allows CCW.

However, as soon as I crossed a bridge, I was in DC or Maryland, neither of which honored the Virginia CCW permit.  So on days when I needed to visit DC or MD,  the gun stayed home.

Under neo liberal era we have seen lower marginal tax rates, the introduction of RSPs, and sales taxes. These effectively transfer the tax burden from the rich to the poor. Those people who have sufficent incoem to save benefit. Household A makes $20,000 a year spends 100%. Household B makes $200,000, and can save something. 'A' pays HST net of credits on 100% of his income. 'A' has no funds to save for an RSP.  Lower maginal tax rates are a good thing until they are not. We are at that point now.

"Unfortunately, it appears that Elagabalus has bought, hook, line and sinker, into the mythology that the liberal media has created around President-Elect Trump.  For one, the bankruptcies of various parts of his business were, by and large, the result of a fall in the real estate market, and a decline in gaming in Atlantic City.  Only once was it the result of a bad economic decision, and that was when he purchased the Plaza Hotel - a decision he recognized was bad, but that was made out of emotion and love for the hotel.    Furthermore, the bankruptcies were all within the law, and designed to keep the businesses operating and people employed, which would not have been the case had bankruptcy not been sought; real people would have lost their jobs.  Also, in each bankruptcy, Trump was required to surrender assets and ownership stakes worth considerable amounts of money.  So, the claim that he ""personally profited at everyone else's expense"" is an obvious lie."	0
"I have not always agreed with Senator McCain's political positions, but have always admired his military service, courage, independence and Senate statesmanship. His speech on the Senate floor, coming just days after major brain surgery, was both inspiring and a challenge to both the Senate, the House and Americans to return to ""regular order"", where critical policy decisions are openly, inclusively and thoughtfully debated. I can think of no more remarkable American to join Alaska's senior Senator in voting their conscience over party dogma (desperation?) and WH strong arm tactics.  Senator McCain will now be vilified by Trump, hardline Republicans and their right wing media supporters (puppets). How regretful and pitiful. He survived 5+ years in captivity in the Hanoi Hilton, endured unimaginable torture, and turned down the chance to be released. At his own physical and mental peril, he chose to stay and support his fellow POW's. I wish I could be half the man Senator McCain is."	0

So, Canada's obsession with America has become so deeply entrenched that even our low-life bigots are targeting, um, American visible minorities on an American day of importance to their visible minorities and supporters.

"The ideas that are being proposed by our federal government related to ""tax reform"" for fairness, to close ""loopholes"" will not only result in higher tax revenue for our Federal government initially but will also result in a much lower level of re-investment by the small business sector. Over time this will result in lower tax revenue as private business will have significantly less capital to invest.  We have operated in Canada over the past 45 plus years on a tax principal of ""integration"", which simply stated means you will pay no more income tax earning money directly vs earning money through a corporation. It has served our economic development and our treasury  well over the years. These proposed changes will not only undue this principal it will result in double taxation for the small business owners that operates their business through a corporation.  Any one who undertakes to go into business, employ people, risk capital should not be subject to double taxation."	0

"I was thinking about this issue about taking Trump seriously again after reading how Trump tweeted he would like to see flag burners prosecuted/removed.  Let's compare it to things said by Kim Kardashian.  It is easy to not take seriously what is stated by celebrities.  Their words have impact and are taken seriously because we, the audience, choose to take it seriously.  One wrong comment or just simply enough time celebrity fades and we stop taking it seriously.  The same is not true for the President of the United States.  What the President says involves the force of law.  While Trump is still only the President-elect there is little indication that Trump will not become the President.  What Trump states will not fade especially if he says one wrong comment (for instance Krushchev's ""we will bury you"" comment) or after four/eight years in office."	0

What a great  article by Marvin Kalb, which will explain a lot of  history to those too young to have lived through it.  While Krushchev  was wildly emotional (he was full of what Russians call dusha) and a committed Communist, he had a decent heart, and he revolutionized the Totalitarian Soviet state and likely saved the world from  a horrific nuclear war.   Like Kalb, I'm sad that the Russians couldn't have maintained a higher level of freedom and am alarmed at the takeover  by autocratic Putinism. Kalb's reference to Peter the Great brought a smile, for back in 1968 when I was in the USSR I took a trip  to the countryside  to visit the supposed hunting cabin of Peter the Great.  It even had a notch on the door frame to indicate Peter's great height .  As I'm also pretty tall, the cheerful Russians (who still seemed to love  Americans back then) pushed me forward to stand against the door, and cheered and and applauded that I almost reached the mark of Peter the Great.

Who conducts business like this? Do they understand the concept of a strike?

The 1% can keep their money in offshore accounts, which they do now, and that money will still not be subject to taxes. Any businesses they have remaining in the country will be moved to a country that appreciates their business and the jobs they create. When that happens, where is Hillary and the democrats going to get that tax revenue then? But it will not only affect the 1%, it will affect the top 25% as well. The question still stands. You are aware that a lot of businesses have already moved offshore, Mexico and the like? Are you also aware that there is at least 2.5 trillion in cash sitting in offshore accounts, not subject to taxes? Trump thinks it is closer to 5 trillion, but why quibble.	0

During the 90-minute meeting, Scaramucci told this person: I need someone who’s prepared to go to the mat and lie for me.""  Scaramucci's job to pump up the president will be eerily similar to the way North Koreans talk about Kim Jong-il, as if he were an infallible god.  The Daily Beast also reported that, hours after he got the White House job, Scaramucci deleted his old tweets praising Hillary, which called her  “the real deal.” Can you say ""selective value system?"""	0

James, so you'd be happy to vote for someone who, as you put it, drinks Kool-Aid, and refuses to engage in critical thinking when lives are at stake?  All of these Kool Aid drinkers in Congress had access to a special NIE (National Intelligence Estimate) about what was really going on within Iraq.  Of the roughly 535 members of Congress, only 8 bothered to read it.  If thoughful members of the public, without access to sensitive, classified, information were able to correctly conclude going to war was a horrible mistake, what is Clinton's excuse?  Oh, right, she was looking at her future as a political opportunist, and didn't want to be on the unpopular side.	0

There is a big difference between being a Nationalist and a Racist.  Let me Illistrate the difference.   In the early part of the 20th Century Italians were brought into the country to help do the dirty jobs the Irish and Germans wouldn’t do anymore.  The new Immigrants we extremely proud of their new citizenship, learned English, the language of business and their new country.  They were instrumental in our victory over Japan and Germany since they comprised the largest immigrant group fighting in World War Two.  They were Nationalist.     The Italians like every other new minority group that came to America faced racism.  So what!  They loved America and were and still are grateful for the opportunities it provided them and their children.    Cowering in victim-hood is a guaranteed way to remain a victim.  Time to do something about it.	0

A Fraser Institute study  , How Alberta’s Carbon Emission Cap Will Reduce Oil Sands Growth,  notes that  the government’s proposed cap of 100 megatonnes of emissions annually for the oilsands sector would reduce its production potential by more than three billion barrels between 2025 and 2040, costing the Canadian economy more than $250 billion in lost production and resulting in a “meager” 0.035 per cent reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.   A $250 Billion cost to reduce global green house gas emissions by 0.035 per cent ?        really.......?   can anyone explain to Canadians on UIC , to the working poor , to the first nations and to the equalization receiving provinces which now include Ontario as well as Quebec why the nation should try to tamp down global ghg levels by a fraction of a fraction of one percent -   rather than tax the billions of dollars generated by energy exportation  toward the benefit of civic , provincial and federal governments?	0

"In the last paragraph the author states: ""Canada's economy can serve that future. The energy transition could become an engine of prosperity depending on what actions we take today."" The McGuinty/Wynne Liberal government bought into this sales pitch in 2009 when it passed the Green Energy Act.  Now, eight years later, the results are clear. The policy has been  an economic disaster. By dramatically over paying for electricity from wind and solar farms (up to 8 times market rates), the Liberal government has given Ontario some of the highest electricity rates in North America and created widespread energy poverty.

"Let's put this immigration deportation into a Canadian perspective, just for comparisons sake, shall we?  Trudeau government revoking citizenship at much higher rate than Conservatives - cbc.ca  ""The 184 revocation decisions of the first 10 months of the Trudeau government nearly match the total number of decisions over a 27-year period between 1988 and the last month of the Harper government in October 2015.  Although the powers being used come from a law passed by Stephen Harper's Conservatives, they have been used much more aggressively under Trudeau.  In the first full month of the law's operation, June 2015, only three revocation decisions were made. None were made in July or August, two in September and two more in October.  The Trudeau cabinet was sworn in on Nov. 4, 2015. That month saw 21 revocation decisions. The following month there were 59.

So, they want the AB taxpayer to loan Calgary the money to be recouped off the backs of businesses in the vicinity? Where's the ticket surcharge? Isn't that the fairer tax - direct user pay? Or were the Flames going to do that to recoup their $275M?  Expecting taxpayers to fund something up front that only a small portion of the population can financially access isn't a good model. Those who can't afford event tickets shouldn't have to fund others to do so...  The only thing I agree with is that it should be a publicly owned rink or a private-public partnership with funds contributed by Edwards, Flames (why not players?), sponsors and users. If the taxpayer is putting in funds, they have to part-owners.    The billionaires and millionaires can't take their money with them after death - better to build a public legacy such as need buildings, schools, programming and so on while they are alive so they can see the benefits.	0

Paul Krugman's argument for 400 trillion in direct stimulus was justified, and it likely would have brought down the debt by generating jobs, more consumer purchases, and more revenues.  In addition, the proposed infrastructure jobs needed (and still need) doing, and the work itself would represent an investment with long-duration returns.  Deficits now run up the debt, and an unstimulated economy produces lower wages and lower return on private investment.  Deficits are caused by inadequate revenue to meet budget needs, and their cure is direct economic stimulation.  The 400 trillion was based mostly on the amount of money that disappeared with the financial collapse of 2008. which took the economy down with it.  Debt itself isn't bad; in fact, without debt, our modern economy just wouldn't work at any level.  Debt is cheap with our practically zero interest rates; and a little more inflation would help to shrink the debt.	0

Every candidate for president has some of the characteristics that you describe.  It is almost a requirement to run for the job.   One of the first questions that you have to answer is why me?   Ego comes with running for the job. Think about it.   Also, one of the requirements of the job is to sometimes put compassion and empathy on a side burner.  Also, there are times that a leader has to bully and blackmail to get things done, and even lie.   Should we get into the ways other presidents have used and abused women and that women have used and abused men?   Also, I disagree that he has had no compassion for others and that he only values others based on their use to him.   Would you have preferred Clinton over him?    Would you have preferred Kim Jung Un to be allowed to continue unimpeded like Obama was doing?   The same thing for Iran?  Oh, and by the way, I like most of his appointments.	0

The switch to allow women, to lower the voting age and eliminate the property requirement all predate the Constitution Act of 1982 which is where we laid out the current rules as to how and when Constitutional Amendments are required.  Had those changes happened after 1982 we WOULD have required a Constitutional Amendment, but because it was before then we instead needed it passed through the British Parliament.  After 1982 we no longer need the British Parliament to pass these changes but we do need to follow our own Constitution.  As to whether it would absolutely require a Constitutional Amendment, that is something that the Supreme Court would decide, but given their decisions on what is, or is not, required for changes to the Senate I can't see them ruling that a simple act of Parliament would be all that is needed.	0

While I do believe Russia tried to influence our elections and should be investigated - it wasn't that long ago that Mitt Romney said Russia was our biggest threat only to be ridiculed by President Obama and most Democrats.  Now that it is politically convenient Russia is back to being a relevant threat?  Were most Democrats not bright enough to see Russia was still a threat just 4 short years ago?  I think the answer is that both parties are being led by people who are more interested in ideology than their country.  Very sad indeed...	0

Interesting - let's suggest a comparable case:  Benny and Australian bishop Wm. Morris - based upon a small right wing group and never published investigation by Chaput, Benny forced Wm. Morris to retire.  Even canon law experts cited that Morris's natural rights were violated - this was unjust.  And, unlike Burke, etc., Morris made no claims of rejecting Benny's statements, etc.  You would go crazy if Francis rejected Burke and made him go silent.  And yet, Benny silenced more than fifty bishops, theologians, and priests - usually without providing documentation (literally a kangaroo court).  Francis, instead, has allowed Burke's stuff to go public - he did not retaliate - he merely has chosen to not respond NOW.	0

I've already heard, from several sources down south, of the aggressive government  programs that may be put in place in order to stimulate job growth and the corresponding plans from various small and medium sized businesses to take advantage of those programs.  It doesn't bode well for Canada.  Jobs will be leaving.  I haven't heard of any plans from our political leaders.  All Trudeau & Wynne talks about are taxes, how one tax is reduced while another  is raised, how taxes are used for a good cause (punish people who leave carbon footprint), new ways taxes can be extracted, and sunny ways.

Trust funds and off shore money are where the real wealthy people hide their money.  Trudeau and Morneau have no clue what middle class is nor do they care.  It’s much easier to vilify the doctor who works 100 hours a week and is close to burning out or a small business person that dared to invest within the corporation so they could have a decent retirement(soon it will be only teachers and public servant who will retire comfortably). The liberals want class warfare to play to the progressive/NDP voters in Quebec and the Maritimes to keep their majority and that’s all they care about.	0
Richard, it is posts like these that bring the comments questioning your intelligence.  The power of the purse, the responsibility of creating a budget is that of the legislature.

You, by supporting these Republicans, are why your PFD has been cut.  Eliminate the oil company subsidies and you eliminate the cut to the PFD.	0
I agree with you about Pence.  I detest his politics an I've lost some respect for him because of some of the things he's said in defense of indefensible utterances of Trump. But I agree that he does seem to be sane, and he seems to have a capacity for sobriety and even, maybe, for listening. I do think that Trump's presidency will collapse (whether by impeachment or resignation) under the weight of his corruption, incompetence, and instability -- but that's a traumatic process for the country.  It really is a nightmare.  Trump has proven during the transition that he's not as bad as we feared, but infinitely worse.	0

"The Bible says Christians are to view the world's behavior and judge whether it is right for the followers of God to live our lives in the same manner ... and the Bible is clear that we are NOT right if we love the world instead of God. Once the clear difference between God's ways versus the world's ways is recognized, Christians are required to adjust accordingly and gather together with like-minded Christians. We aren't supposed to try and force the world to align itself with our beliefs, but we must be prepared to disobey any laws that try to force us to disobey God. Jesus warned His disciples and therefore us, that the world would not love our decision to obey Him rather than them. So, yes, as a Christian, I would judge you as a Christian based on your political affiliations because that says a lot about your heart and whether you view Christians as having the God-given authority to say ""no"" to the world."	0

"""The PFD is not income it is an entitlement or welfare check as it is ""unearned""."".....    Perhaps a rereading of the article will clear up your confusion.  In a nutshell, the oil belongs to the people of Alaska, the people sold their oil, they saved some of their money in the Permanent Fund where it generates earnings and returns some of it via a dividend to it's shareholders, the people.  So if Trump's business's pay him a dividend is that welfare?    Now what's wrong with entitlements?  When you pay for something are you not entitled to something in return?

You bring up France as an excellent example.    - the World Health Organization rates France at #1 in the world.  America is #37.  - it's not 'free' in France.  People and their employers pay insurance premiums.  But they're a lot lower than what we pay.  - Doctor pay in public hospitals averages about $100K.  The US averages $190K.  But they don't need malpractice insurance and med school is free (really competitive to get in).  - they don't have separate Medicaid/VA/Medicare/IHS/....systems.  They're all consolidated.  Way more efficient.  - they spend 1/2 per person that we do  - It's not perfect in France.  They face rising costs too.  - We could learn a lot from each other if our politicians would pull their heads out of their partisan asses. Lisa made a good first start.

You know why? If they committed any of the atrocities, mayhem, murder, chaos, pillage, rape or attacks upon Jews and Christians... they would be immediately and summarily EXECUTED.

"The ""deprivation"" of the identity of the Québécois Nation Anglo na-na-da  is an ""expert"" in the field. Is it not what Anglo Canada has done with the ""deprivation"" of First Nations Cultures?  ""Cultural Genocide"", said one of them, oui ? After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Québec. Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.… 	 And Paf ! Problems started across French Canada ever since !"	0

gtm,I don't offer this  for several reasons. First, not all ETF's are worth their salt and all lot of others are not available to me as an MFDA advisor.  I use ETF's in fixed income but not equities. I am a believer in managed assets but I am also aware that not all managers are good and some carriers charge too much to manage them. Part of my job is to help in the weeding out process.  I mostly use F class funds with MERs of less than 1%. However, nominee accounts fees ($125-$200 per year) can be costly for small accounts so client held accounts are more suitable in many situations.  Think of somebody just opening a TFSA with $2,000 to deposit or some young parents wanting to start an RESP with $50 per month.  In addition, as you mentioned, trailer fees are virtually hassle free for both me and my clients.  I dread the idea of having to create an invoice and collection arrangement.  I can see that you have a lot of faith in ETFs. I do not have the same opinion.	0
I'm also glad they dropped electoral reform but it rubs salt in the wounds for Canadians using it in their platform to get elected, bungle the file from the onset, and then have the audacity to blame the Opposition for all their mistakes.  It's just like the Liberal's idiocy for deploying the Phoenix payroll system knowing full well it wasn't ready and ignoring all the repeated warnings from the experts for a full year and then have the audacity to blame the Conservatives when they had full control on when it would be deployed.  These Liberals are incapable of handling anything without turning it into a disaster so why would we expect these NAFTA negotiations to turn out any better which is my point?	1

You are welcome to hold on to your cynical point of view.  I am not going to try to prove you wrong, though I know that people who know me and work with me understand where I am coming from and recognize what my intentions are.  I have given far more to this community than it has given me, and will continue to advocate for what I see as progress.  We may not agree on what 'progress' looks like, and that just is what it is.  You can rest assured that I have less 'skin in the game' than you think.   Pretty simple actually, if you don't like the governance you have, vote and replace them.  We all come to this with our own POV (which is subjective of course) What I saw on Monday night at City Council was a bunch of young people (the future of Eugene) stepping up with positive visions of what Eugene can be vs a small contingent of 'we don't trust you' negativity that is, to me, stuck in the past.   I see a change happening in Eugene, and I think it is for the better.	0
"The big issue concerning the ""greenness"" of EVs in Hawaii is where does most of the energy to generate the electricity to charge them come from?  That's right:  fossil fuel.  We haven't built huge on- or off-shore wind farms and commercial-scale ocean-thermal energy or tidal systems.  Neither have we committed large parcels of land to photovoltaic cells, and, unlike the Mainland, nuclear plants and hydroelectric generators are non-starters.  I can see an EV owner claiming it's a ""chicken or the egg"" argument when it comes to building an infrastructure to support consumer EVs as the technology now exists.  However, that doesn't change the present reality in this state.  Here, EVs are hardly ""greener"" than fuel-efficient gasoline or diesel passenger vehicles."	0

As to your bail point, I would think that would rely on several things. Amount of evidence against him, how much money he can come up with and the determination of the judge. Bail IS a constitutional right (The Eighth Amendment (Amendment VIII) of the United States Constitution prohibits the federal government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishment.)  The judge however can deny bail if he has reason to believe that the suspect is a flight risk or further risk to the community.	0

Large Licenced Producers are spraying 17 pesticides/fungicides all through the cannabis flowering with the blessing of Health Canada.  Buds in flowers are covered with sticky trichomes that act like glue.  No craft grower would do that.

Clearly, you don't understand Gross Domestic Product and other concepts in economics (circular flow of money, artificial barriers to employment). If a person is unemployed (or underemployed, whatever the case) he or she does not contribute to GDP. Multiply this loss by the millions of people in such predicament and you'll see lower GDP, lower tax revenues collected, etc. Unemployment due to the artificial barrier of background checks results in an annual $65 billion hit to GDP.	0

Your comment is gold.   Also, if anyone has ever worked at a university they quickly realize that the student body is pretty diverse. Students are admitted to university programs based on academic and other merit.   However, when subjective factors such as race and other biases enter  into the interview process to hire and promote university staff and faculty — suddenly there is little to no diversity among those retained.   Confronting this real and documented discrimination in hiring and promotion practice is perceived as a significant threat people who believe that social inequality should continue.  Unfortunately, news stories such as these are often magnets for people who need to justify their hate for people with different colour skin.   In decades past, the same vitriol would have been directed towards women in the workplace.  We're seeing history repeat, but fortunately the notion of basic human rights trumps ignorance, hate and discrimination in international law.	0

This is a very dangerous precedent for the NDP.

Excellent! Powell is right on, and, full disclosure, a pal. I'm a sporadic Resist Trump Tuesday person and proud to support  our national representatives (most of them) while they raise a ruckus resisting the insanity of the administration.

You must have good insurance, provided and paid for at little or no cost to you. Ask the person that is suffering and can't afford medical care how they feel about universal health care. Even poor health care is better than none, when the option is no treatment, dieing or continued suffering. The universal health care that this country provides can be as good or bad as our elected officials want it to be. As Trump so often states,  he will make America great again, shouldn't that include making our health care great again?	0

Why is Boy spending his holiday time with the head of the worldwide Muslim Ismailis?  Why is this billionaire's Aga Khan museum in Toronto tax exempt? It was privately funded. Our family has received countless full colour flyers advertising the Aga Khan museum, yet he claims it is a 'place of worship'. We are not Muslim.  Ismailis are required to give 5 – 12% of their annual income to the Aga Khan. He is the top breeder of thoroughbred horses in France, owns a bank in Pakistan, plantations in Kenya, and a chain of luxury hotels together with his private jet and massive walled estate in Chantilly, France – making his personal wealth estimated at over $15 billion.  Yet, he doesn't want to pay taxes on his Aga Khan 'museum' and 'place of worship' in Toronto.   And he invites Boy & family to spend private time with him on his private island. And Boy accepts. Quietly and secretly.	0

I can't disagree with this analysis. It's a long process to impeach a president and it is impressive that his base is so loyal. The good thing for America is that Trump has not affected the economy because big business really doesn't care anymore and despite Trump's threats.  Trump will propbably survive 4 years because it's too difficult to replace him. It's up to the Democratic Party to find a better candidate that doesn't resemble Clinton.  I still think Trump will quit if Meuller requests his tax returns. Trump is all about winning and saving face and enriching himself and his family.	0

Real, who are these mothers who never bore children? Huh?   My thought is that anyone who is mothering (or fathering) towards others, especially the elderly who need help, is enhancing his/her own soul. Rather than fixed and meaningless 'gender roles' may we wish for those mothering and fathering a blessing with gifts of the Holy Spirit. In my view, the best father is not one who plays a particular 'gender role' (set by a pope or a committee or by cultural fiat?) but one who has character and strength and leadership and caring. Likewise the best mother -- she has character and strength and leadership and caring. Such parents set a good example for their children	0
As I recall, Jeff, it was Harper who stood up in the Commons and declared that Quebec was a nation. It was the Liberals who, admittedly a bit late in the day, crafted legislation governing any secession votes and subsequent negotiations. Now I fundamentally disagree with the NDP's 50% + 1 position which it has held for a very long time, well before Singh got the leadership, but it's a bit much to blame Singh for it!  I agree that the NDP will have a hard time ever forming a federal government in this country but that has more to do with it being too far to the left for most Canadians. Having said that, the Liberals had better shift a tad to the left if it wants to avoid being collateral to voter fatigue with increasing right wing politics in this country. In Alberta, the NDP attained power because the PCs had made such a pig's ear of things.	0

This is the source of the funds many Halifax city councilors are accepting and there is evidence of undue influence with neighbourhood ruining projects going ahead  against the wishes of  the existing property owners. Things like large high rise condo apartment buildings plunked  down amidst century old single family houses. It is also doubtful  there is, in fact,  demand for much of the new construction considering the extremely high vacancy rate for both residential and commercial properties but capital from failed states can wait a long time for a return if that's what it takes to clean it up. Is city council in someones back pocket? Stay tuned.	0

"""...more need for talent than could ever be realistically produced by Canadian universities and colleges.""   Your premise is overly general. Few people disagree with importing advanced technical skills on a case by case basis. That's not what Microsoft - or MacDonald's for that matter - have been demanding. They want free rein. Some want expertise they genuinely can't find here; many want to trim their payroll. Let's do our best to accommodate the former - and give short-shrift to the latter.   That's the short run answer. The longer term solution is to make sure those universities and colleges are capable of delivering the best technical education available anywhere in the world, and that Canadians who meet the entry standards have access to that education as a right - not on the basis of loading themselves and their families with a mountain of debt."	0

If the author is correct in his assessment Taiwan should not rejoice yet on this apparent improvement of its status. Trump could in the end throw it under the bus as part of a deal with China.  Trump has begun negotiations with China by playing rough. He will continue this line of action until he gets what he wants which I assume is a redress of trade with China. Currently the US runs an annual deficit of as much as $240 billion with China. To achieve his jobs creation policy Trump must significantly reduce it. Shifting that much trade activity will be a wrenching change for China since it runs a deficit with much of the rest of the world. It will obviously resist and must be pushed off its position.  However, Trump is smart enough to know that he cannot get his way on everything and must give on a few things to get what he wants. Taiwan will be bargaining chip.  Taiwan should not rejoice yet. Trump could give it to China in exchange for jobs in America.	0
"Of the people that take responsibility for their ""self defense"" (ie. not freeloaders on society), the most common tool is a firearm.  Today, the sales of handguns far out number long guns.

"When no less an authority than the Economist magazine called Paul Martin ""Mr. Dithers"",  Martin did not complain about it or demand they stop calling him names.

This is the Minister let's not forget, that blew millions of taxpayer dollars to take a contingent of people larger than the US, Australian and UK contingents *combined* to the Paris soiree during which billions more were promised.  McKenna's problem is not that people are calling her names, her problem is that her behavior is garnering more and more negative attention, she has spent massive amounts of taxpayer money and she can't take the type of  criticism that others have.  The question is - Is the description/criticism unwarranted, inaccurate or over the top?  The answer is that no  - it appears not to be."	0

True DCARR82775, but unlike before, now a direct witness to the events and the deal has surfaced, one who was undercover investigating it, and can put the entire scandal together concerning the Clinton Charity accepting millions from Russians involved, while Ms. Clinton was Secretary of State, etc.,. A witness who was in the know, who was forced to accept a non-disclosure agreement by the Obama Administration.  Lets hear what he has to say, maybe Mr. Mueller has some explaining to do as well as he was Director of the FBI at the time. Why not get to the truth? Surely all would like the hear from a witness, one forced not to disclose, testify before congress as to just what he investigated and found, right?  Was America for sale as the Clinton Charity took in millions from foreign powers while Ms. Clinton was on Washington in a seat of immense power. Let's hear from the man, give him immunity, remove the non-disclosure agreement, let's hear what he found as an undercover investigator.	0

A few points for you to 'mis-remember: 1. I am not a Trump supporter, have never on any site or this one suggested that. So buzz off and try to stick to the truth. I actually dislike him but that is no reason to like the just as evil Democratic thugs, women abusers. 2. Please provide empirical proof that he lies 74% of the time. 3. Provide evidence that he is the most dishonest man elected to public office, i.e. show us the evidence of the thousands of public office bearers (lets make it easy just since 1865 after the Democratic/Slave Party got whipped) and their lying to truth ratios. Presume you have all the files/proof close at hand? 5. Trump said women let celebs doing anything, which in the US is true. Plus he said this  when he was a Dem. supporter/funder. That is why he got off, prove otherwise., 4. Note you couldn't care less about Bill C,  (he abused women most of his public life) Weinstein and all the other ''let off'' Democratic abusing women.

"Comment 2  A thought on the pitiful Vatican laws and judicial systems used to divert attention to minor figures so that big guys are protected.

They divert attention, again, to non-clerical ""culprits"" and then end up with actually imposing no more penalty than has already been paid by the two in having quit or been fired from their jobs.

As recently reported in the National Post, a new study indicates that Canadians aren't nearly as open to mass immigration as many might assume. The study indicates that while only 20% fully support shutting down immigration completely another 35% are ambivalent and wouldn't oppose such a policy. Further, a majority of respondents feel that immigrants aren't connected to Canadian society and an even more feel that immigrants need to do more to adapt to Canadian society. The study suggests that while Canadians are more open to immigration from poor countries than are, say, Hungarians, they are less so than are citizens of many other Western countries.  http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/canadians-not-so-exceptional-when-it-comes-to-immigration-and-refugee-views-new-study-finds	0

Good piece Mr. Wohlforth!  I grew up in a small town in California which was deemed too small to have a high school but had elementary schools. The solution was to bus the older kids 10 miles away for high school.  Perhaps with some creative thinking some villages could be tied together in this way for the common good. Of course school buses would not work. But I read someplace about other northern communities using hovercraft to transport kids back and forth to schools on frozen or unfrozen river systems. Hovercraft are not that complex and a fleet could be built in Alaska if they could not be acquired cheaply outside. By closing a few schools and sending kids upriver for the day to a full high school like those enjoyed in the city everyone involved gets a better shot a good education. And they can still live in their ancestral homes too....	0

I agree with Donald Duck in that I question why the MIL has to go to such degrees (submitting a letter to advice column) to prove her point. I think MIL should spend some time on Therapist's couch in order to learn about focusing on things she can control and exposing the roots of her deep-seated resentment so that while she can in future observe her reaction, she doesn't have to spend time obsessing about it in order to figure out what to DO about it and then go about FIXING it.  Better to put her time and energy into helping at a homeless shelter or something!	0
Meh - there's a lot to be said for having to work for your college tuition but I don't see anything wrong with parents helping their kids out especially if they can afford it.  Don't most people just saddle themselves with student loans anyway?  Is that really a good idea?  And the post you replied to was totally tongue in cheek too.  Not only were my parents not broke they were more concerned that I would do well in school than spend all my time working for a meager wage to pay the high costs that minimum wage could never do.  That said it was nice to have the help because if cost were really a concern I would have gone to some place much less expensive - and that's a good school too - I respect them but the cost of an education is ridiculous to expect the average 18 year old to afford without some assistance.  And that other school I didn't go to gets a ton of state money anyway so we were paying for that too.	0

Absolutely right!  Even with his oppressive police state, Castro had the continuing support of the Cuban people over decades.  For better or worse - no matter how odious the comparison - Castro was the Cuban people's George Washington.  I always felt sorry for the Cuban people that they had to listen to Castro harangue on the TV for hours.  My childhood feelings and memories of Castro are frozen at the time of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.  I grew up near Washington DC, and I still remember that Castro help bring the fear of mass destruction into our home.  Most of Bautista's supporters eventually made their way to Miami where they waged unremitting propaganda warfare with Fidel for 50 years.  I always found it intriguing that Cuban Americans in Florida usually referred to Castro by his first name - is that affection turned bad by betrayal?	0

I think you got that view from another G&M opinion piece I remember reading which, once again, wasn’t based on fact. Pipeline companies charge tolls to ship oil or gas and those tolls are mandated by the national regulator. Doesn’t have anything to do with the price of oil (so much for your Econ 101 tutorial). Here’s some more basic economics and energy knowledge for you, when Eastern Canada imports oil via ship (tidewater) that oil is based off Brent pricing. Brent oil currently trades at a ~$7 premium to WTI. Canadian oil is landlocked due to lack of infrastructure thus trades off WTI.

Just the opposite, John. When gov't gets into the charity business it drives out Catholic Charities, Lutheran Services, any number Left, Right or Center. Then the gov't demand that if a certain church organizations wants to get funding to continue their mission, they have to follow gov't guidelines. Many Christo-centric programs are very successful, but because of these stipulations, lose a lot of effectiveness.  I believe the individual knows best how to spend/donate/waste better than any bureaucrat. It is why I advocate for unlimited charitable contributions be given to ANY qualified organization. If you think Planned Parenthood does an admirable job, as many in Hollywood do, let them fund it to their hearts content. But, let it be up to the individual.	0

To be fair the port is an economic engine for the state, not only the city. The port brings in most of the state's goods, which are then trucked or taken by rail to other parts of the state, including the Kenai, Fairbanks and Mat-Su where they are bought and sold. This creates economic drives in those regions as well, so while the port itself helps Anchorage, its secondary and tertiary impacts hit most of the state.	0
"There you go again, making stuff up.  Mr. Trump had nothing to do with any discriminatory tactics nor was he taken to court.

You cannot possibly verify that especially in light of at least one President (Bill Clinton) who was impeached for lying.  You propose that ""facts"" be verified, however, you are guilty of making up your own facts and this has been pointed out to you on several occasions.

It most certainly has not. Trump won 98% of counties in the US and 38 of 50 state's votes.

Smaller companies with little international trade exposure (imports or exports) may be unaffected or even profit by it, but I think US multinationals are in for a world of hurt.

Now women are giving up sex as they always had, just not getting a thing in return because they don't need it. Some try to withhold it in order to get more than sex for it, but fails miserably because there are plenty of sex starved women frequently willing to give more for it, specially if they can pretend to themselves and the world that they aren't paying for sex.  Women aren't happy with it, one because they have that itch that say sex isn't as hot if they aren't exploring the man, second because they aren't getting it easily, worst, they are having to work for it, specially because they think they could get more. Back in the day a woman was happy to fuck a guy, and if she got pregnant she was happy to have him to help her support her and his kids and to have someone to fuck for the rest of her life, and she'd be probably happy to cheat a few times too.

British Columbia's rent controls work reasonably well - I've been a landlord and a tenant here.  Briefly, they apply to all residential tenancies. Rents are allowed to increase annually at 2% over the official rate of inflation, adjusted each year, for so long as the same tenant stays in the unit/house. Change of ownership (landlord) doesn't affect it. When the tenant moves out, the landlord is free to set any rate he/she wants to negotiate and can't increase it for a year, and then only by the inflation+2% rate again.    The system seems pretty well balanced between owners and tenants to me.  Victoria has a crazy real estate frenzy just now, but there are several rental apartment buildings under construction, and many many condos for rent and under construction.	0

Yet those guys stress that they have a right to have recreational sex with women even if they use the permitted but ineffective temperature method of contraception thus risking an unwanted or dangerous pregnancy.Those guys'  attitude persists, due to the effectiveness of their radial programming at an early age.	1

Layla4,  Since you do not claim to have worked in a law or accounting firm that deals with trusts and holdco's, and do not admit to having a trust account, nor helping to set up one for someone else, you have no direct knowledge of them.  I would prefer to communicate with those who actually know what they are talking about because there is a very good chance that people like you are passing on incorrect information.	0
I heard that San Francisco passed a law that allowed owner/occupiers who live in their home 270 or more days a year to AirBNB their home or a portion thereof to gather supplemental income, but NOT allow people to just rent out entire homes year-round. This seems like a reasonable way to allow local residents to participate (regardless of where they are on island or zoning) while ensuring that the rental housing market isn't decimated. I agree something has to be done and the more stringent approach is superior to self-certification.	0

The single biggest cost driver in the ACA is the pre-existing condition mandate.  This transforms insurance into a payment plan, and in this case, an unaffordable one.  With costs as they are there's simply no way we can afford to cover everyone for a reasonable price.	0
"Well, there you go.    You freely admit that Democrats from the '50s are Republicans of today.  Ergo, Alaskans haven't changed, their chosen party has.      This means your assertion that ""voting red"" because of those evil pipeliners moving to AK doesn't hold water.  And we've always been conservative.    And Christian.    Sure, we have a small annoying granola population and the college kids don't know any better yet, but you'll have that anywhere - it's a natural occurrence and they're harmless for the most part.     It is exceedingly rare to run across an old-school Alaskan who identifies as a liberal.    A strange case indeed.  What gives?"	0
I wonder if this is some sort of political ploy by the majority caucus in the state House.  At this point in time it is necessary for the majority and minority caucus of the House to find some acceptable compromise to access the CBR.  One day after the House missed the deadline we see this new bill which was abandoned as part of last year's compromise.  At first blush, this bill offers no adjusted numbers or other data relevant to current budget discussion.  Speaker Chenault refuses to have the bill referred to a committee that focuses on the facts and figures regarding labor.  Rep. Johnson's suggests that there could be many more such bills.  It is plausible to consider that the majority caucus is entrenching rather than discussing how to reach a compromise with the minority caucus.  It seems politics is no longer the art of compromise.  IIRC, last year the majority tried to push their budget through the court of popular opinion and failed.  Now it is extortion by way of new bills?	0
Electric is clearly the future for cars. Battery costs are falling as sales volumes continue to grow exponentially every year. Even in Ontario, the cost of electricity is one tenth the cost of gasoline to drive the same distance. We drive a lot in our electric cars (including as far afield as Florida) and have saved over $20K in gas costs over the past four years. They work every day, rain or shine, hot or cold (from -40 to +30 degrees C), never a problem with range or running out of charge.	0

Freedom of speech and freedom of conscience are cornerstones of both science and democratic government. . Both require decision-making based on rational assessment of facts in the marketplace of ideas. . Neither is safe when the marketplace of ideas is (a) fact-free or (b) truth-optional. . One of the great ironies is that the future of decision-making based on reason, whether in science or in democratic government, is critically endangered not by our inability to teach math and science, ... . ... but rather by our failure to teach history and literature.	0

how is it that as this article claims we have some of the best schools turning out talent yet need to attract talent from abroad. The answer is that much of our home grown talent has moved to the US.

The not very pretty picture that emerged since the election is of the Premier & her Party shambolically thrashing about in aimless desperation in hope to find some path to salvage their tenure as the Government.  The net effect to date must be Liberal Party supporters increasingly shaken but nor stirred, NDP & Green supporters with increasing resolve & confidence and swing voters turning away from the Liberals.  Today's announcement that there are ample funds to pay for the NDP & Green proposals simply compounds the Liberal problems.  Assuming Clark gets the snap election she so desperately wants, what platform can the Liberals led by her credibly run on?  How can Liberals argue against the current NDP & Green platforms save on the Kinder Morgan & Site C Dam issues?  It's one thing to lose another election soon having fought a principled campaign on a coherent and consistent platform, it's another to drift unancored to electoral disaster.	0

Political reform, especially for an entrenched political party, is a tough go. Did she file an appeal to a process she felt unfair? No, she opted for drama. With the solid victory at the precinct caucuses, the Sanders group has positioned itself to be the new dominant force within the Hawaii Democratic Party, perhaps the most significant change in the party since the 54 Revolution. This was accomplished in one year, the 54 Democrats took almost a decade. Obviously, in the moment emotions run high, still the Sanders group is remarkably well positioned for the future. Using existing rules, they will, with consistent hard work, have a huge impact nationally. Instead of celebrating a step that two years ago was considered impossible, she opted and evidently still opts for petulance and drama. Easy to get mad. The change she wants to accomplish will require hard work and the support of the People, even those who disagree.	0

Hey AKland voucher that sounds like a question for your favorite legislature, if we can dump $700 mil on the most profitable corporations in the world, what the heck is wrong with an Alaskan corporation getting some also?

Hey didn't the state put a bunch of money into the Delta barley project, maybe they would be interested in leasing land to grow weed on in Glennallen, I think I saw an article the weed cops were worried that the grow operations  would suck up all the electricity in the state so this is a timely discovery. Congratulations Ahtna for persevering on this project and good luck in the discovery phase. Maybe all those gardening projects will pay off also.bruce	0

"(Part one of two)  Dogmatic teaching needs no ""updating"".—mjmchale  Really.  updating considerations of human sexuality based on experiences of the Faithful, is called for, as social sciences learn more about experiences of the Faithful.  At this time, there may be no need to “update” dogmatic teaching, though the administration of The Catholic (Pontifical) University of America seems to think so, by refusing to give professors a chance to explain themselves before firing them, thereby earning the continuing 1990 censure of the American Association of University Professors.  When it comes to human sexuality, the Teaching Magisterium has changed its proclamation from denying human sexual pleasure is a legitimate part of the purpose of human sexuality, to accepting that human sexual pleasure is a legitimate part of the purpose of human sexuality.  The problem is determining the criteria for exactly what constitutes dogma."	0
UK intelligence has the partial recording of the tape delivered to the Russians by Carter Page.  Mr. Trump is on the tape.

He will be subject to criminal prosecution once he is no longer a public official.	0

I feel sorry for people like my parents that got burned in 2011 when the income trusts got busted up.  They were  basically pyramid schemes as corporate vehicles.    The income trust structure induced companies to pay equity back to investors (pay them with their own money).  With ever shrinking equity, they had to issue new shares to buy established companies to raise overall income to pay the same dividend per share.  It was bad for CRA, for GDP, and for the last investors in.	0
These two judges (and the ones before them) have seriously overstepped their Constitutional authority and have issued rulings based on politics rather than the law.  Not only did they not apply the Constitution and legislated law with respect to the issue, they phonied up, or have serious problems with, reasoning.  In their pursuit to block the authority of this President, they have created a Constitutional crisis by  ruling to give foreigners, who aren't in the United States, have no business in the US, and are NOT US citizens, the Constitutional right of religious freedom under the 1st amendment.   Applying the 1st amendment to foreigners overseas can have consequences beyond their limited thinking.  The President was within the law & his authority with the 1st executive order, and that is certainly true with this one.  The also have broken their oath of office.	0

When I attended Catholic grade school and high school we were assured that there was no pressing  need to study scripture or theology because the Church had already done that on our behalf. With a great deal of confidence the priests and sisters  told us that if we took the Baltimore  catechism to heart and lived accordingly everything would be fine. It was enough to know that we were in the one true Church and other Christians were beyond the pale. We were not concerned with defending our faith or  debating the merits with non believers who were likely to go to hell. It was a much simpler time.	0

Worse, they won't say who ordered the revised hours or why they won't give the park back to the residents, families and others who need it open in a high rise area with 10,000 nearby residents and no parks. Just another example of how the city is shutting park and recreation access."	0

It seems clear that the very opposite of the editorial's last sentence is true:  The Clinton Foundation's real and only causes for existence were precisely because of Hillary's previous and future runs for the White House - and because of the Clintons' desire to (1) keep all their hangers-on (chief among them, daughter Chelsea) grandly employed while they all helped her run for President and (2) so that the whole apparatus could be used to sell influence and make money for the Clinton's themselves.

I worked my way through the UO. I didn't benefit from being a minority. The truth is that when I made it clear that I didn't come here to play football, I was not able to see an academic advisor until I got to grad school. My father sent me packing when I was 16. I'm a self made man. As a vocational counselor I helped about 13,000 Lane Co. residents find work. About 90% of them were white. I'm retired now so I don't need to coddle white folks to be employed. If you are female, you can benefit from Affirmative Action. The truth is more white women got work and college educations from that program than black people. Maybe you should have studied harder in school. Have you heard of Title 9. It was to help women go to college. That is why there are women sports programs on every campus.

About a year ago we went to the new system where, instead of a large community mail box ,  pods of mailboxes were installed to serve small clusters of homes and it has worked out well.

Let's keep this new system. It's OK.	0

Vancouver is a city built from neighborhoods!!! Sadly the various levels of government didn't care about that and wanted the money the increase in property value gave them. Plus and maybe more important to make their developer buddies rich and happy.   Chinatown finally got the city to listen. Finally something that Chinatown was against got stopped for those that live there and those that are concerned about Vancouver becoming a city without neighborhoods. Finally there is some hope for the future that those who support and care for Chinatown will be involved with shaping the future of the neighborhood.	0

The thing is, even a random unsubstantiated fishing expedition like this, it is going to start pulling in lunkers!. Trump University was not a fluke. He coughed up $25M because he knew he was guilty of fraud. It is going to keep snowballing for four years or an impeachment, whichever comes first.  Trump scammed and weaseled his way through the business world, and an election. But now that he's POTUS 44, national security issues are attached to everything he's ever done. It's all fair game for investigation now. I wonder how long until the compulsive liar in chief and his lying-ass staff start to run afoul of perjury problems. Irregardless, it's going to be a bumpy ride!	1

"""There is no “blank page” to stare you down; there is a series of notes to follow. An outline is a far more powerful motivator than a timer.""

"In Colorado, the police do not have to observe the suspect actually driving in order to charge them with Driving under the Influence. Colorado law has embraced a concept that has been labelled ""actual physical control."" We see this quite frequently in DUI cases. It is common for someone to be charged with DUI even when their car is not in motion. So long as the driver is in the driver's seat, and the keys are in the ignition, the driver has demonstrated ""actual physical control"" of the vehicle. In a case involving these facts, the criminal defense attorney handling the case at trial would not be allowed to argue to the jury that the driver wasn't driving, therefore should to be found guilty of DUI. The judge would not allow this argument so long as there had been a pretrial ruling that actual physical control had been demonstrated by the facts in the case.

I am a first line supervisor who reported wrong doing by my upper management at the VA where I work.  An investigation showed my allegations to be true.  They didn't fire any of my upper management.  They simply found other jobs for them a couple of weeks ago.  Now they are targeting me for removal.  After 20 yrs of VA service and being prior military prior to that I now have received a recent suspension and less than successful evaluation all within the past month.  I saw the list of 500 fired employees and in my VA I saw no supervisors on thst list.  They are targeting lower ancillary staff and whistleblowers such as myself.  Shulkin is very aware of the ongoing hostile work environment going on in my VA and still has yet to even come talk with the staff here.

From the comments , it appears that right-wingers would sooner see the economy tanking rather than improving so they can whine more convincingly to each other about Trudeau. It's what they do best. But the sane majority of Canadians will see this as good news and appreciate the stronger dollar and strengthening economy. Governments don't create jobs. They simply try to make the conditions the most optimal to create more opportunities in an ever-changing economy. The workplace is changing despite governments, and people are going to have to adapt to the changes, including re-educating themselves when their jobs become obsolete.	0

Maybe there's more to it than you know, hmm?  Nobody, not even Harper's lawyers, argued that the Charter didn't apply in Khadr's situation because he was in a foreign country.

"I always find the Star Wars/Star Trek debate funny because they seem so different to me that I have a hard time understanding how the two can be compared. Star Trek was created as a series of books and an episodic TV show, meaning that it was meant to have discreet stories told and wrapped up in a short time. Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic. There are many other reasons, but fundamentally, comparing SW and ST does not seem like an appropriate comparison. (Also, if you insist on comparing them, it would probably be best to be done by someone with a reasonable degree of knowledge of both properties.)"	0

They express their opinion. They threaten to close the workplace.” _____________________________________________ Way to miss the point. The issue is not employer intimidation. It is Union intimidation of members who don't vote along with the majority.	0

This stretch feels the same as that Nationals series where they were totally mismatched and they recovered fine. Unfortunately they just ran into the 2 hottest teams in baseball back to back.   Are they on the same level as these 2...obviously not as currently constructed but are still a good team. I do look forward to seeing how Anderson performs on Sunday and how Gray will look upon his return which seems to be lining up for next week. Hopefully that solidifies the rotation but the rookies did a nice job holding down the rotation especially compared to years past.	0

As a disabled veteran and a VA employee, I can tell you that there's a lot that goes on that you're not seeing. Please don't dismiss this article and the experiences of others based on your experience.   I was getting all my care at the VA until last year. Now, all my care is in the community because as an employee  I know leadership advocates the violation of directives in place to protect patients.  The boots on the ground - medical staff and support staff, are for the most part doing the best they can, but mismanagement is real and mgmt  dictates that staff do things that risk the safety of patients. When we refuse and report - we get terminated. I was one of those and was later reinstated, only to have all my computer access and privileges taken away which meant I couldn't do my job.   This article is only the tip of the iceberg.   Most of the time patients are unaware of the things that could adversely affect their care until it actually happens to them - until they're the one.	0
Their leadership does't really care.	0

"Mr. Picard, you are the loudest voice in Canada for medical issues. This article is factual and sensible. You are not wrong when you say we must stop romanizing alcohol. That's an ideal outlook. In reality, lawmakers and social engineeers have been advocating for alcohol bans for driving and other high risk activities. I still think as a society, we might be another 50 years away from an outright ban. The issue is of course money. Or taxes on alcohol. It's like gambling addiction. We know it's harmful but the tax revenue is seductive.  I suppose the answer is a replacement ""sin"" tax for alcohol.  I do like an occasional beer on a hot summer day though. Nothing better.

Why should anyone think Donald Trump, or any President for that matter is going to do anything for them? Too many in today's society look to the government to take care of them. The Office of the President is one of our three branches of government which has little to no power in enacting policy and law without oversight of the other two branches. It seems that many need a reminder that the first three words in the Constitution are We the People. Sad part is that there are those that do not participate in our government and get upset when certain matters don't go the way they think they should.	0

The last refuge of a liberal; The race card.

Show me one Trump or Tea Party demonstration that has ever turned violent to the extent  that Hillary constituents have.  Liberalism thrives on division.  If you would ever study history with an honest open mind like you proclaim you have you would find that some of the greatest democrat icons of all, from Andrew Jackson to Robert Byrd were racists of the worst kind.

The selective saturation coverage the media gives to police shootings of black victims has led many and apparently the players to conclude it is far more prevalent than it actually is. Statistics compiled by the Federal Government for 2015 and 2016 show that the chances of an unarmed black man being shot and killed by the police is about the same as being struck by lightning. In other words, exceedingly rare. And black cop are actually more likely than white cops to shoot black victims. Those are the facts. What I find most offensive about the protests is that they are based on falsehoods and the players, ignorant of the facts, are being used as tools by the political left in this country intent on perpetuating the lie that the police and country as a whole are systemically racist.	0

The simple truth is that the Republicans welcomed a foreign government interfering in the election on their behalf. They knew and they were happy about it and they are now doing everything in their power to cover it up. There is no other way to look at it. Republican leaders were so hungry to kill people on Medicaid, bankrupt the middle class and give tax cuts to their millionaire friends that they knowingly allowed a foreign government to help that corrupt, incompetent imbecile into the White House.

Unfortunately, and unless I am mistaken, the FCPA net would not catch these criminals just because of the dollar being used.

"12 year old unrelated and unsupported anecdotes simply aren't what's relevant and neither are your 'beliefs'.    France has 4000 troops, armor, helicopters and planes supporting Niger forces.

"“... Such pronouncements are unacceptable, whether comrades have a preference or not, and seek to usurp the entrenched right of the branches to nominate candidates of their choosing...” If Gwede followed his own logic, he would have condemned, with equal measure, all the current ANC presidential candidates for ""usurping the right of branches to nominate presidential candidates.  Gwede renders sterile the right of branches to nominate candidates by denying them the crucial information on which such nominations must rely. How will the branches exercise their right if they don't know who is available for election, and have no idea of the kind of leadership collective the proposed presidential candidates prefer to work with?

"I disagree with the idea that ""it’s easier to start out with more regulations than to try to regulate after the fact"". It may be easier for the government; it is most certainly not easier for those being regulated. Repealing pointless regulations tends to be a low priority for government; repealing regulations that should not exist but are supported by a small constituency is even lower priority. The result is that if ""more regulations"" are put in place, they ossify and it often takes decades to get rid of them after it's clear that they are a mistake.  Marijuana prohibition itself is a horrible example. It was done by regulation without any debate or examination of the (lack of) scientific evidence to support prohibition; fifty years after the fact, the LeDain Commission recognized that prohibition was a mistake, and more than forty years after that we are finally moving to legalize. In other words, we had a bad regulation in 1923 and by the time we're rid of it, 95 years has passed."	0

It's just as ridiculous to think that mental illness is not an issue as it is to think that access to guns is not an issue.	0

"First off, I cannot agree with this:  ""A lot of people carry guns,"" he said. ""It's just like if you got a credit card, you're going to spend with it. If you've got a gun, you're probably going to use it.""  No, most people will not.  As for suicides, the reality is that most are not the result of considerable forethought. They tend to happen at a particularly low moment. The person may have shown signs of instability, but most don't take their lives after careful consideration. It's an act of desperation. And as the article notes, alcohol is frequently a contributing factor. Where guns become an issue is that they are the most effective means of ending one's life. Other methods have lower success rates (success being an unfortunate term here). Where guns are easily accessible, suicide rates are higher. Attempts might not be, but fulfillment of the act is. It can't be honestly argued that guns aren't a factor. The question is, how do we curb these tragedies without infringing gun rights?"	0
"Alexander Durbin--more unscientific, mewling twaddle from the ""animal rights"" fanatics. Here's why no reasonable person should ever take these self-hating idiots seriously: the founder of their movement, Peter Singer, argues that a dog has more ""moral value"" than a two year-old human child, and therefore to kill a dog is a greater crime ""ethically"" than to kill a toddler.  Singer cheerfully admitted third-trimester abortions killed children, and chided pro-abortion advocates with dishonesty for arguing otherwise.  He's OK with it.  Such destructive idiocy is nothing new.  It was first promulgated by the Third Reich. In 1933 Reichsmarschall Herman Goering outlawed medical research on animals, threatening those who ""...still think they can continue to treat animals as inanimate property..."" with concentration camp internment. Experimenting on German Jews and Gypsies was, of course, allowed.  These are the true sources--and ""values""--of the so-called ""animal rights"" movement."	0

When your FCS QB is a wannabe FBS QB, runs 20 times and is the only runner in double digit carries(next closest was 8 carries)...you are not running a team offense...you are running the QB(the one in the game) offense. This is the problem with these one-and-done FCS QBs...they spend a good portion of their ONE season trying to prove / show they belong at the FBS level. The season is now 1/4 complete and our backup QBs who presumably will be next year starters have played one snap. Deciding to go back to back seasons with quick fix QBs has damaged the progress of the team and program. Coupled with Helfrich's casual coaching style and the end result is hardly surprising now!!	0

"Thank you for the thoughtful reply. First, you ask when high-profile athletes will take the steps you name, but again, how do you know they aren't? It doesn't take much digging to find countless examples. Second, with all due respect, you are making a very common (not to mention frustrating) error when you frame this issue as one of blame and accountability. Set those self-limiting concepts aside for a moment, and consider the challenges of ""the cities"" (to use AKdorf's phrase) as a function not of individuals but of the legacy of systems of government and economics that for decades if not centuries operated to benefit certain classes over others. As for Obama serving two terms, that is evidence of an extraordinarily gifted man succeeding in a particular set of circumstances.

You can't always get what you want, Ms. Robinson.

I believe there are three kinds of homeless.  One kind is honestly schizophrenic.  Another is addicted to drugs and/or alcohol.  Then there is the third type that has legitimately fallen onto hard times not related to mental illness or addiction.  The third type is the kind that cooperates with the outreach workers and goes to a shelter.  The first two kinds are the ones saying they will move somewhere else and hell no to getting an kind of help.  What a sad world it is when the crazy have a right to sit on the sidewalk screaming and swearing at everyone walking past or else the ones poisoning their brains with substances legal or illegal. No drugs or alcohol allowed in the shelters.  Remember that when you see these homeless on the 6 O' clock news and they refuse to be helped.  I say it is time to drug test all occupants of these illegal encampments.  Find anything in them and treat them like everyone else possessing illegal substances.	0

If anyone is unfamiliar with the Dallas TX police pension fund, you may wish to do a bit of research on recent activity there. The pension fund doesn't have a fraction of the money needed to cover their promises, so cops there are stampeding for the early retirement door. They need to pull their pension money NOW, before it's just gone. This - of course - is accelerating the financial woes.

Comey testified today that the FBI had found nothing to support Trump’s claim that Obama ordered the tapping of his phones during the campaign.  He did not say there was no wiretapping, he said there was no evidence Obama ordered it.  And then Comey drops a bombshell by revealing that the FBI has been investigating the Trump campaign since last July and that there is another ongoing counterintelligence investigation involving classified matters being conducted, also involving the Trump campaign.  It is no secret that such investigations routinely involve wiretapping or other electronic surveillance.  Trump may be wrong about who ordered the wiretapping, but I believe he is right about his phones being wiretapped or electronically surveilled.	0

Yes, I've got it; hurl your names and hateful propaganda with impunity. Again, name another country that has as many successful folks of color that have either been brought here or immigrated here. Bet you can't. Now, with so many successful folks of color living in the U.S., how can our country possibly be, as a whole, racist? Sure, there are pockets of racism. Not just white on black. You can and will find that anywhere. Clearly, you cannot answer the question to sustain your view(s), or you would have. We all know now what you prefer.	0

You may not be aware of this, but after the coal miners in West Virginia were defeated by the US Army, they never recovered all of their arms or ammunition.  I have relatives who still have those very weapons, hanging on the walls as a reminder.  Their day-to-day weapons will not be given up just because the wimps pass a law, either.    There are more people who believe that government is to be feared than pandered to on this issue.    I don't think 330 million privately-owned weapons will be taken away from all of their owners.     And many of those type of people actually live  in the outlying areas of the Willamette Valley, as well.	0

Have you read SB5005, which was reintroduced by Governor Walker this last special session. It rolls back many of the changes SB21 made. Mr. Cole has been an advocate of the Governor's balanced plan, which always included oil tax reform.  Let's be clear, it was the Senate that squashed any chance of meaningful oil tax reform. In particular, the Senate Finance Committee. Put the blame on Sens. Kelly, MacKinnon, Miccichi, Dunleavy, Bishop, Hoffman, and Olson.   Listen to the Senate Finance Committees meeting last Wednesday at the Taj McHawker. It's clearly evident that MacKinnon, Kelly, and Dunleavy had no intention of moving any meaningful reforms forward.  An excellent audio recording can be heard at leaddogalaska.net	0

The corporate elite of the Alaska Commission on Post Secondary Education  did away with forgiveness of student loans by Alaskans if they teach in Alaska for a few years.  Alaska has been going backwards in education for a long time.  The teachers in rural Alaska are more like migrant workers with zero understanding of indigenous cultures or different ways of living besides surburbia.   After decades of racist (primarily White migrant) teachers migrating in and out of classrooms, what is a community to expect?  Why not hold the Alaska Commission on Post Secondary Education accountable for this absolute failure to retain local Alaska talent. Bring back the ability for Alaskans to have their student loans forgiven after getting a 2-4 year degree (instead of being managed by some Corporation out of State making money off of Alaskans student loan debt).   Real solutions instead of this racist banter against Alaska Native People.	0

Oh give it a rest, CFL!!! The fact is that there were 40 years of Conservative govts in AB that basically did little planning for the future. Jim Prentice was predicting a 5 billion dollar deficit which would have undoubtedly ballooned when the real truth was known if he had been elected. I am sick of the belly aching about the NDP deficit that would have been there anyway under a PC govt. Rachel Notley walked into a mess caused by decades of Conservative mismanagement combined with world wide oil prices that she had and has no control over. That is a fact! So get used to it and get off her back! You now have two former Harper minions waiting in the wings to try to topple her. The ultimate slime ball has to be Kenney.

Any state that enacts a proportional approach on its own would reduce its own influence.   If states were to ever start adopt a proportional approach on a piecemeal basis, each additional state adopting the approach would increase the influence of the remaining states and thereby would decrease the incentive of the remaining states to adopt it. A state-by-state process of adopting a proportional approach would quickly bring itself to a halt, leaving the states that adopted it with only minimal influence in presidential elections.  The National Popular Vote bill is the way to make every person's vote equal and matter to their candidate because it guarantees that the candidate who gets the most votes in all 50 states and DC becomes President. That's what most Americans want.	0

Why are we encouraging and accepting high numbers of immigrants from countries where it is clear that they will arrive in Canada with very different values, limited education, and very little to add to our society, other than bringing potential division and conflict? I believe that in most cases their children or grandchildren will adapt to a more open and modern society, and I also believe that cultural diversity is good and that we all benefit from it intangibly, but we also must ask ourselves when opening the door to people with radically different ideas on democracy, equality of the sexes, and education ... what do they bring to this country?

Sue it is very interesting to go over a list of what Donald promised to do and compare that list to what he has not mentioned since he won the election.  Even more troubling is to follow what some of his revised plans are when it get to who will benefit from say tax cuts, child care deductions, or maternity leave.    Just wait and see how quickly some of the Trump claims will be reversed; During the election the number of unemployed kept increasing as Trump claims it was actual over 20% not the 5% government numbers.  By gong back to the government methodology Trump will have this fantastic reduction from his claimed 20 % to what ever he dreams up at the time. The illegal immigrant numbers grew from ten million to 25 or more million during the eighteen months. Change that back to the old numbers and wow a fantastic decrease is accomplished in mere minutes.	0

"Pope Francis did not agree to look into it again, he said emphatically in answer to a question, ""the door is closed."" St John Paul II's Ordinatio Sacerdotalis is the last word upon the issue from now to kingdom come, even Pope Francis realises this. You may be confused due to his opening of a discussion relating to deaconesses but as regards the priesthood the 'door is firmly closed'. Even if the Catholic Church revived the order of deaconesses, no deaconesses would ever be allowed to serve as a liturgical 'deacon' in a celebration of the Mass or in any of the ceremonies of the 1962 Missal."	0
We observed the Santa Clara remodel as we ate our soup.  The expensive and huge open olive bar was serving free samples, but we couldn't see them from our side.  We watched as the crew of workers there busily performed their chores.  The soup was bland, and the cashier had no idea how to operate the register.  I would have preferred a salad bar.  During our visit, no customers patronized the olive bar, or even the fancy $7.95 panninis over at the bakery.   I remarked that this whole idea was born out of top management having absolutely no idea who their customers were.   This half-hearted attempt to compete for upscale customers appears to be a failure only the accountants and shareholders  will notice at the end of the year.	0

The tourism industry in Hawaii is completely mismanaged by all levels of our government and us residents have had it with all these negative effects on our quality of life.

It is well past time for Hawaii to evolve out of this tourism-at-all-costs era, and to come up with creative alternative industries that diversify our value and wealth. We sell ourselves short by believing that tourism is the best we have to offer the world.	0

A review of Winter's columns over the last year:   He's chastised the Knights of Columbus, everyone who voted for Trump (more than a couple of columns on that), most of the other Catholic opinion websites (even the moderate ones like the other NCR) for not being authentically Catholic.   He dunned the Catholics who worked with Evangelicals, and now New Ways Ministry.   Many words, little research.  He's written that he's totally for illegal immigration, and also written that the traffickers who make illegal immigration possible only exist....because of Republicans.    And of course, Winters has written much about climate change and how he's very much against it, and we should do something about it, immediately.   Some of these columns on ecology might have been written while MSW was flying on a gross polluting jet to Europe for yet another very important conference.  Surely NCR can do better.	0

The speech is a distillation from the internal discussions regarding: 1.  North Korea; 2. the adoption of limited free market participation; 3. the pressure that China is placing on competitors for territorial claims; 4. its substantial and growing trading clout; 5. its increasingly prominent position as a partner in major world institutions, eg the UN; 6. its apparently successful governance as reflected by China's current wealth, and world stature; 7. etc.  I guess it is an invitation of sorts to countries like North Korea to discuss leadership and political models. I suspect that NK won't bite, although there may be enough discussion at leadership levels to question a path which puts it on what is apparently an inevitable course to war. One of the things that NK has lacked, compared with the USSR and China, is a state security force with constant and direct exposure to life abroad, and the inevitable internal discussion that may  generate.	0

Disturbing. As a Philosophy student and motorcycle mechanic I learned to identify with empiricism. Both these challenges helped me to stop indulging in idealism and anthropomorphism. There are no ghosts in the machines. Authentic knowledge is best found by observing what exists outside our consciousness.  I achieved an epistemological metamorphosis to identifying with a way of thinking rather than a set of beliefs. Identifying with empiricism inoculated me against ideologies. I learned this from studying Bacon, Darwin, Galileo, Diderot, Rob Muzzy, Rick Andrews.... All people who had previously, and consciously taken this evolutionary, epistemological step.  To see our political leaders identify with ideologies and indulge in reasoning that is no better than superstition, is disturbing. I yearn to be led by people who identify with empiricism. I suspect this is the aspiration of many Canadians.	0

It's possible for a single person to live cheaper in Honolulu than LA - especially if you don't cook much because groceries are higher in Honolulu. If you mostly eat out, Hawaii plate lunch is cheaper and more food than similar in LA. Bus here works. LA is patchwork of different bus and rail systems. You gotta drive. Beach life and potluck social scene here WAY cheaper than going out in LA. The clothing most folks wear for work and play here way cheaper than fashion show LA peer pressure. And if you drive, you probably go fewer miles here than you would in LA. None of this works though if you don't mind living in East LA and far suburbs. Those areas cheaper than here no matter how you play it, and salaries in LA tend to be higher too. Hawaii still better by a long shot. Like LA, but never regret moving home. Lucky you live Hawaii!	0

Let it happen!!! Then maybe our legislatures will get off their lazy butts, quit quibbling, and find a solution of reducing their spending.  They are only costing us more money every day they do not come up with a solution to reduce their spending.  They are not listening to the countless people who have provided viable solutions that will not create a new tax or spend our states PFD to nothing.  I am all for letting it happen as it may cause them to really figure it out.  Also I would suggest they do not get paid a dime till they do.  Put that money towards our states expenses!	0

Public schools fail to pay teachers the wage they deserve.  Social Security provides less mathematically than if you invested the same amount in stock mutual funds.  The medical industry including Big Pharma are heavily regulated leading to inflated prices on products and services.  Profit is necessary to continue to provide higher quality and lower prices over open competition.  The obvious negative of the free market is it may take time to emerge with enough competitors in order to increase supply to meet demand at competitive prices.	0
Justine Trudeau's Canada is looking more and more like Kathleen Wynne's Ontario.

As for you who think 'Diversity is our strength' and 'Equality and fairness for all' actually mean something to Justine, you're sadly mistaken.  Notice how all the socialist and communist dictators live in the lap of luxury, flying to the bahamas on private jets and helicopters, all while spouting off nonsense while they raise taxes and brand everyone else racist and a tax cheat?

NK firing even one missile of any kind and actually hitting a US target would most certainly result in NK complete destruction. The USA could fire hundreds of cruise missiles into NK in minutes.

One experimental missile against hundreds of proven tried and true cruise missiles is no meaningful comparison.	0

Trump's enemies seem oblivious to how they're making matters potentially worse. By attacking his every word and deed as outrageous or evil, they are setting Trump up for vindication. Trump could've had vindication on the immigration issue in another way, too. In the event that terrorists from any of countries covered by his EO mounted an attack against the USA or its personnel overseas, he would've come out looking like the hero that tried to prevent it. In fact that could still be the case any time in the future.  Vindication and redemption are two very powerful narratives in politics. By rhetorically over-reacting to everything Trump does, and by denigrating him personally, Trump's enemies set the stage for his eventual triumph.  Next up? They're going to find no evidence that Trump colluded with the Russians in the last election, and that the so-called Russian influence in that election was minimal. Don't say I didn't warn you.	0

Norway 'wealth funds' are actually just their pension funds. They have the ' Government Pension Fund Global' and the 'The Government Pension Fund Norway'.   We have some too. CPP 'Canada Pension Plan', QPP 'Quebec Pension Plan', OTPP 'Ontario Teachers Pension Plan', OMERS 'Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System', SPP 'Saskatchewan Pension Plan'.  I am sure there are many more.   Although none of these are funded directly through oil and gas revenues, because our taxation and wealth distribution system in Canada differs from Norway's (read 'equalization'), indirectly much of this wealth ends up in our various pension funds as well.	0

It is unfortunate that western countries are caught in a 'group think' bubble when looking at Iran (ie. Axis of Evil), without really analyzing Iran's actions versus US name-calling.  If one compares Iran's actions against those of Saudi Arabia (eg. 9/11 attackers, support for ISIS and other extremist groups, spread of Wahabist doctrine in Western and Middle East countries, leading the onslaught on Yeman, suppression of domestic and foreign Sunnis, etc.) one could easily make a case for friend versus foe. Yes, Iran has an abysmal record on human rights and religious intolerance. It also supports Hamas and Hezbollah. But those pale in comparison to what Saudi Arabia has done and is still doing.  Perhaps it is time for an in depth evaluation of the conflicts in the Middle East instead of merely following the path that Bush, Netanyahu and Blair staked out many years ago.	0

"Perhaps Pete engaged in a bit of hyperbole with the ""best qualified candidate in U.S. history.""  However, we don't need to engage in that debate,  She's not running against all the other candidates for President in U.S. history.  We really need only compare her to the one candidate she is running against, Donald Trump.( I dismiss Mr. Johnson since he's a non-viable candidate).  I support Ms Clinton, who, despite her flaws, is clearly a more qualified and less ""problematic"" candidate than Donald Trump.  Ms Clinton is, IMO, a hawkish, pro-business . right of center politician with an ""overlay"" of progressive social views.  As a liberal/progressive I'm less than enthralled with her as President.  However, given the ""choice"", she's far and away the best we can do this fall.    While my endorsement is a bit less enthusiastic than Mr. Sorenson's,  I will be voting for Ms Clinton this November.    BTW: I will add that  Mr. Trump, again IMO, IS  the LEAST QUALIFIED candidate in US History."	0

I was just listening to someone talking about how regulation is more or less so successful (in this case, it was general regulation, such as worker safety, consumer safety) and that's what makes it possible to have these radicals scratching their head and using this appeal to ignorance in order to postulate that we don't need regulation - or else very, very little.   And I was reminded of similar lines of reasoning explaining the rise of anti-vaxxer irrationality as well. Makes a lot of sense to me. People with any sense of history would never argue for such nonsense in either case, but ignorance in one area opens the door to regulation denialism, and ignorance in another permits vaccine denialism.	0
I definitely see the argument for why we need to keep many boomers working, but that isn't enough. Finding solutions for supporting our aging population will, of course, require a more holistic approach than what is put forward here. As Canadians, we have to be mindful of the bigger picture and the long term picture. For instance, how do we create more jobs for millennials if boomers are staying in their existing roles? What about encouraging families to have more children and how can that be supported in a sustainable way? How about supporting those who have lost their jobs in failing industries to re-enter the workforce in a different capacity? What about immigration? These are just a few questions this brought up for me, anyways...	0

Pot cost $0.10-0.25 per gram to grow indoors and almost nothing to grow outdoors. Corruption, greed, narcissistic, mean, evil...it is beyond words to charge Canadians $8.00 for something that cost so little with a gun to their heads. Even by companies with ties to the Liberal party. - The problems are massive. They are not getting rid of the black market.  Canadians can grow 4 plants in their backyard with minimal effort, 4 plants can produce 4kg's, which can be sold to their pals for $16,000 dollars! Heck even at $2 a gram it is an easy $8k. Forget chickens or tomatoes folks.  - Canadian pot head will spend $4000-10,000 from the weed shop a year. No. They will grow in their basement, in their closets, in their condos. Think of the waste of electricity. Think of the smell coming  from bellow of flowering plants. Think of the mold problems. It is very bad idea. Pots needs to be sold @ 2-3$ a gram to be fair and dissuade home grows and the home markets.	0

After all, throughout all our politics we are just listening to tried and true manipulative rhetoric stored in a special politician writers book.  Maybe, in fact, Melania's use of Obama's lines was a characteristic Trumpian refusal to do the ""correct"" thing.  That's what I like about Trump.

Is this guy losing his mind. Talking to billionaires about the middle class? Give me a break. I think the bloom is coming off the rose. The year 2018 will see Trudeau and his government virtually fall apart. They have promised so much which Canadians care about i.e. jobs and they are failing miserably. They do know how to spend money and it will take the country years of austerity to get rid of the debt this incompetent government is generating. However, we can all be grateful the cabinet is gender neutral, he is a feminist and believes in climate change.	0

"RE: ""Trudeau ‘comfortable’ with Norsat takeover despite U.S. concerns""  Justin Trudeau is completely out of touch with reality.  Trudeau is also responsible for breaking many election promises and running a massive budget deficit - when indeed, he doesn't have to, this should come as no surprise, he and his party are absolute taxaholic spendthrifts.   Justin Trudeau has proven to Canada since his inception as PM that he is a disingenuous, opportunistic, narcissistic, sociopath.   He's absolutely the LAST person in Canada that should be leading this country.   Justin Trudeau needs to be permanently removed from holding ANY public office at all, ASAP, and the PMO even sooner!!"	0
You claim owning a gun is a right.  Where does this right come from?  You can't use the Second Amendment, because that logic forms a suicide pact.  The Second Amendment provides for the uninfringable right to keep and bear arms--all weapons of any kind, and nothing therein precludes weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons, or nuclear arms.  So we have a right to bear arms or we don't, and if we don't we get a line somewhere--and how we adjust that line is about public safety.	0

I have a hunch that Shell would have preferred cash to shares and, to the extent that the shares lose value over time, Shell will simply chalk up any losses as a cost of doing business. The bet on oil sands is binary - either wellhead prices exceed production costs + overhead, or they don't. Some investors may be willing to make this bet, perhaps arguing that the price paid for the assets (or the shares) already reflects an appropriate discount. But this bet assumes that reference crude prices i.e. WTI will rise considerably AND that the differential between oil sands wellhead prices and WTI will contract appreciably. Saudi Aramco will soon offer shares to the public and it will boast the lowest finding, development & lifting costs on the planet PLUS a quality premium for its crude. Not that they desire to, but we can assume that Shell would rather own shares in Aramco, even at a substantially higher valuation to oil sands operators.	0

I have seen nothing yet from Trump's administration that makes any rational sense. Sorry.

If we're going to talk about which group is being demeaned as evil and demented I think it would be the one who you're calling baby-killing communists who hate America. Just a guess.  A gay marriage is not obscene. If you don't like the idea of making cakes in a country where gay people have the freedom to marry then move to Saudi Arabia.  In regards to your broken analogy nobody is telling Jews to serve non-kosher food or Muslims to serve pork. If they DID want to serve those things, then they should serve those things equally to every customer.  Now, if a pharmacy doesn't want to serve the morning after pill they shouldn't be forced to carry a product they don't want. I agree with you there. But when Christians pass legislation to limit the choices for everyone, that I disagree with. We cannot make a world where Christians never have to encounter things they disagree with. That is a world of special privilege. He did not make the cake, he chose to stop making cakes all together.	1

It was not Canadians so much as Pierre Trudeau that liked Fidel Castro. He liked all communist dictators. He visited China during Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward, when 30 million Chinese starved to death, but didn't notice anything was wrong. After Mao died the Chinese technocrats reformed the economic system to make it more like capitalism than communism. The Chinese economy expanded at double digits for 20 years and is now bigger than the American economy.  In Cuba, he failed to notice that Castro was a dictator who was jailing tens of thousands of his opponents and executed at least 1000 of them.   I looked at the 1950s, when Castro took over. At the time Cuba was relatively wealthy for Latin America with a per-capita income similar to Spain. Back then, both were right-wing directorships. By the time Castro died, Spain was a modern democracy in the EU, and its average income was 5 times as high. Cuba's average income is still the same as it was in 1955. Franco died, Castro didn't.	0

We will likely pay a big price for refusing to evolve our supply management system over the past few years.  Canada has been experiencing intense pressure in every trade agreement negotiation.  We could have been proactive in making smaller changes by now that would have increased production, made us more competitive, lowered prices a little, etc..  But when no one is willing to compromise one litre or egg then it will come to the place where the supply management system will be sacrificed for something Canada wants or needs more.   The rising consumer demand in Canada itself will demand this change.  We shouldn't just stick our heads in the sand and pretend this problem will just go away but we should proactively begin our changes now.	0

"You're revising, or forgetting the facts.     The Federal Court ruled that Khadr's rights had been violated because CSIS officials illegally shared information from interviews with the US Investigators.   This was 2005.    This ruling was appealed.  2008 - The Supreme Court concluded that the sharing of information WAS illegal and a violation of Khadr's rights.   Harper (as PM) criticized the courts.  2009 - The Federal Appeals Court upheld that a ruling that Canada must repatriate Khadr.     The Harper Govt appealed.  2010 - The SCC ruled that Khadr's rights had been violated but ruled that repatriation was not a remedy which the courts had power or jurisdiction to make.     2012 - Khadr repatriated.  So there is plenty of blame to go around.    As well, you should remember that Harper, as Opposition Leader, stood up in the House and called Arar a ""terrorist"".    This for a man who did nothing wrong.    So it's not like he took power in 2006 with the goal to respect everyone's rights."	0

I testified. But wasn't outraged the board didn't show, mindful that they are unpaid, put in the hours, engage the public, work with staff, and debate with one another what's best and right. I welcome them to watch the tape later or read the summary. That said, the issue at hand addresses the most pressing problem in the state today. Same as 30 years ago. It's the lack of shelter, leading homelessness. It's gotten worse. One in five families needs public rental housing. 50,000 households. For 5,000 units. Another one in five makes too much to qualify for this rental housing, but too little to buy a home. Or an affordable market rental unit. This is shameful. Not aloha. Would that instead getting angry, and polarizing, we unite. I understand the anger. I don't see why we let this fester: the private sector is capable, the public sector has ways, means and tons of resources. Voters want it. But history repeats. And we wonder why homelessness is becoming the norm. Unacceptable	0

From what I was told and read, ""carpetbagger"" is anyone from the North, trying to upset the racial social order in the south after the war. Now I never wrote that KKK didn't harm black people. Their targets were people who were upsetting the social order. These are mostly white Northerners trying to get blacks to vote, educate them, trying to ensure their rights or even to better themselves. Any blacks adhering to these ideals, were targeted as well. Now these white Northerners, are outnumbered, their black followers often take the hits. This is more then just war profiteers although they existed and targeted. Freedman's Bureau, white educators and just about anyone who were advocating for blacks' rights, were targeted. Their numbers were not high as the blacks but their existence was the reason for the Klan's initial existence."	0

"Unless the detectives told the R-G that they make a point of scrutinizing crime victims who have disclosed that they had marijuana -- a questionable practice, since this would tend to discourage victims from reporting serious crimes such as robberies -- there is no point in disclosing Whitlock's history.

"I recall that Robert Lucky, the former head of research at Bell Labs, winner of the Marconi Prize, and author of the book ""Silicon Dreams"" used to challenge computer science students to suggest the main reason that we haven't been able to create a digital human yet (this was back in the '80s and 90s). The students would provide the standard answers about chip speed and size, memory storage, etc. Then he would ask them, if they were going to have to program human traits into such a machine, to explain how they would define such things as an appreciation for good music over bad music, a sense of humour, an appreciation for poetry, etc. since those are all defining traits of humans. The students would stare at him, not quite understanding what he was talking about. Fortunately, Robert Lucky was a smart engineer with an appreciation for the humanities. We always need more people like him."	0

"I hate to burst your bubble, free-fire fetishists, but the NRA has no more interest in you as an individual gun owner than the Tobacco Institute had in you as an individual puffer. It is a trade group tasked to increase the profits of the weapons manufacturers, at any cost. It deals in bribes and threats, carrot and stick, nothing else. The body count of American bystanders is beside the point. The point is more, more, MORE gun sales.   Here's an incredibly obvious piece of political advice—follow the money.  There is no such thing as an absolute right to individual assault weapon ownership. If you refuse to accept any sane restrictions on guns that the overwhelming majority of Americans are begging for; if you insist on proclaiming that you have more of a God-given right to make massive bang bangs than a child has to celebrate his or her next birthday, you are likely to lose more of your ""freedoms"" than you think.

Some might think that the infallible dogma of the Immaculate Conception glorifies Mary. Just the reverse. It tells the believer that Mary is merely human and subject to the contamination of original sin; this stain only removed by Father-god. If 'he' had not intervened, Mary would be contaminated with original sin. This dogma also lets the believer know that Mary is not the Great Goddess. The Great Goddess was not conceived. She had no parents. She always was. So Mary who was conceived and had named parents cannot be the Great Goddess who was not conceived. This is similar to the Book of John where Mary stands at the cross next to her sister. The Great Goddess, primordial mother of all, did not have parents or a sister. Thus Mary cannot be the Great Goddess who had no sister. So the myth re-making continues and She continues to be diminished. In the article the Pope says don't pray to her for easy favors. So now people can't even pray to her? Maybe not unless they bring flowers first.	0

Even municipalities such as Innisville are adopting uber for their public transportation because it much cheaper than creating their own. - Rent control in Ontario has create a huge shortage of house.

Haven't seen your other questions. Been a little busy. Waving on a street corner, making phone calls, knocking on doors, delivering a big sign to Mary Lou at Diamond Jim's in Indian and attending the Girdwood Board of Supervisors. Just got home. And I don't see anyone named Saul Goodtome in the annals of Alaska politics. Why not just be yourself? The campaign space is very convenient to access the House 27 side of the district. Why must it be in the district? You do realize that the Senate district consists of two House districts. I picked a practical location on a main thoroughfare between my home, work office, and district. It's working quite well, thank you.	0

Really, are you so naïve to believe the courts make the correct decision all the time?  I personally believe the court made the error using his age as a defence.  Canadians under 16 years of age have been convicted of murder.  As well, the Americans gave the compound a 30 minute advance warning they were going to attack.  Women and children left the compound, Omar did not.	0
Yes, it's true that many businesses (in particular small, service-based labour-intensive businesses like restaurants and retail stores) are based on a premise of low-cost labour. And yes, they should pay their workers a fair wage. The problem is the timing. It's very difficult for a restaurant owner to hike prices for food and drinks in lock-step with the wage raises without customers noticing and buying less or coming less often. If it is done more gradually, it isn't a shock to the system, keeps consumer demand steady, and creates a win-win for all.	0
Trump uses our ratings driven media for sensationalism.  I'm happy to see that the media are now fact checking Trump's lies and digging into who he really is [compulsive liar, fascist, racist, sexual predator, and crook].  It would have been much better for us all if they had done their jobs before the election! Trump’s agenda and propaganda to our prosperity and national security is shall I say “extreme”.    It’s no secret that the 2-party system is powerful and corrupt. The Democratic and Republican run debate commission blocks fair exposure to 3rd party candidates and naive and brainwashed voters continue to disregard viable choices that would help break the gridlock that has created corruption and such a vast political divide.  I'll continue voting 3rd party / independent in state wide and federal elections.  Voters hold the power to facilitate change by reaching out to their representatives or in the voting booth [next time]!	1
"Regarding: ""It was a master class in manipulation by Trump and no one in the press corps had an answer."" - What makes Trump a master at manipulation is that the press do not know how to recognize it or respond to it. After all, who in the media is trained on techniques for interviewing someone like Trump? - When Trump skipped around on his favourite topics the media should have questions, equally important, but equally off script and unexpected. For example (making up an example): ""I have saved jobs""; ""President elect: where do you stand on unions and until know why have xxx number of legal actions against you or your companies been about violations of union contracts and rules? Would Trump provide an answer - probably not, but it would allow the media to respond to his manipulation. - Or, another made up example; ""ACA is a disaster!"". To which then, the media inquires how much red ink has the ACA reduced for hospitals, especially, public hospitals, in the US since ACA's passage?"	0
I have to ask why are we sending millions of pounds of seafood to China to process and then have it come back to the U.S.A to be sold?  The act in its self makes no logical sense when we are closing down processing plants, cannery's and putting people out of work right here.  I would love to see a spreadsheet justifying the cost and time involved in doing this, but I would bet no one is willing to produce it because it would show how much we are getting ripped off by big business so that they can pocket it all for themselves.	0

Wouldn't it be ironic if support for right-minded action in this case has the unintended result of showering more undeserved attention on armed militants? Yes, I agree, with the underlying sentiment.

"Apted, here's my rant, which starts with I own more guns than any sane person should. I have ALWAYS been with Bill Ruger.

""I never meant for simple civilians to have my 20 or 30 round mags or my folding stock.""  ""I see nothing wrong with waiting periods.""  I believe we are reaching a tipping point that even the idiot savant Lapierre will not be able to counter, whereby many babies might get thrown out with the bath water unless some reasonable concessions are made.

Even though sex-discrimination issues related to loss of status issues were addressed in Bill C-31 in 1985 and again in Bill C-3 in 2010, government still retained some loopholes and slipped a self destruct mechanism into the definition of status. Look up '6.2 status' and the 'second generation cutoff rule'. With the 2 generation cutoff rule 'status Indians' will disappear before long.   Fortunately, with the Descheneaux decision in August, 2015, government was ordered to close the sex-discrimination loopholes and rectify other unrelated status registration issues by February 2017. That process began in February 2016 with the new government to address the issues that were before the court. A second phase to address other status issues has begun and is expected to be completed in 2018.   Of the topics being discussed are the 2 generation cutoff rule, First Nations administration of status and band registration and whether government should retain a role in status determination at all.	0

Pelosi and Schumer HAVE to meet with the President regularly. To do so would only deepen the divide in the country and draw further distaste from the electorate. They don't have to agree with him on policy, just as he doesn't have to agree with them either.  However, when it comes to things like DACA and the budget, they do. They agree on key points, which gets things done in the U.S.  Keep in mind that President Trump was a Democrat until the Obama administration, and acts more like an independent at times because it's his job to do what is best for the country. We may not agree with what he says is best, but one side will definitely do.	0

These folks refuse to comprehend that they were the imaginary majority. All those in our system had a voice in the form of a vote. On one side, there was the divisive straight-male-hating-vicious-gay-Facebook-feminists, who (still) believe their education entitles them the privilege of dictating what is best for (atheist) America. On the other side, there were God fearing, Coal miners, Farmers, factory workers and other inclusive minded human beings. They believe that the country is for everyone! In the sixties we learned, you MUST work within the system for positive change. No one has turned their back on the protesters. The protesters have turned their backs on American democracy. The day will dawn when we have a fantastic all-inclusive female president! Remember, millions of people thought Hitler was right, but it didn't make him right.

I frequently work in the area around Gastown. The dealers are easy to see, they are on every block. For some reason the police don't bust them anymore. Instead, we have the police, the fire brigade and the paramedics all rushing around reviving and putting collapsed junkies back on the sidewalk. We have many social services on every block, providing free food, free shelter, free condoms, free needles, free crack-pipes, plus referrals to other free stuff. Naturally, most of those those interested in getting high arrive broke from outside Vancouver.  The mayor blames someone else and continues to spend like crazy on bike infrastructure. Taxes go up and the housing in the sporty green resort becomes more expensive. The mayor likes expensive green housing and blames the province for high housing costs.   The druggies come here because everything is free for them and there are no police charges; they can shoot up outside the police station nothing will happen.	0

One of the purposes of the ACA is to reduce medical costs and encourage healthy choices.

in all seriousness Alceste...your ability and the ability of other self-identified non-Liberals to focus on the shortcomings of the present Liberal government under Mr Trudeau , and call those shortcomings out forcefully and publicly, say, here in a comment forum, has absolutely nothing to do with any partisan screeching from Conservatives....  here's why what you're trying to deflect is exactly that, deflection...because what you're really concerned about is that if you forcefully hold the Trudeau Liberals to account, you're concerned that that will contribute to a weakening of Liberal support and an increase in Conservative support ...if you could be comfortable that calling out the Liberals would act to empower the NDP, you'd have no issue...but I suspect you're not sure that's the case...and you're probably right.

"Paul,  Nope and I have no plans to.  I already know that neither she nor Bill served in the military.

One side of this silly argument chose a political career and another until recently, a private sector career which he still maintains.

I think both candidates should be given a 100 multiple choice questions, 25 fill in the blank questions, and ten essay questions test and have the results and answers publicly posted.

"Posts talk about how Trump in 2017 is accomplishing what Hitler accomplished in the 1930s.  That reveals a shocking degree of pampered parochialism in their thinking.  Right now the TV is on, NBC from America. The first reports were these:  - Trump's bans against Muslim majority countries are causing chaos for travelers of many types - The tweet from Justin Trudeau is read out word for word (""... Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith..."") - a Muslim mosque in Texas burned down last night, and investigators are probing it as possible hate crime, having arrested a local man for a hate crime a few years ago involving that mosque.  Hello?  Germany's 1930's press was no conduit of empathy and facts about minorities. Indeed, Goebbels, the government master of newspapers then, fired all Jewish journalists in 1933. Cartoons of Jews as rodents then appeared, and claims that Jews needed blood of Christians for rituals.  Get a grip. America is not 1930s Germany. Not even close."	0

What a mess a despot still in power, millions of sunnie Muslims  displaced, 100,000's dead, Europe overrun with Sunnie muslins, Christans dead as well,  and a country where they lived now cleared out. By the way none of the displaced are in oil rich sunnie kingdoms. They are/were people with intense love of family, tribal in mature and the love of their god, but misled by the leadership.  But this is the way it is over there. All Obama had to do was to say the despot king was the leader of the country and stay away, this was not going to be another Iraq, but he still had some advisors who though Saudie Araba was their friend. You must know and having lived over there for 6 years, the Arabs are only interested in your help if it will improve their own agenda, everything else is not true.	0

A Boston TV station described Parsons Brinckerhoff as “infamous in Massachusetts,” and linked with “shoddy work and cost overruns.”     There is also a highly critical audit of Parson Brinckerhoff’s work in California as program manager of that state’s high-speed rail project. The audit complains of “inadequate planning, weak oversight, and lax contract management.”  Parsons Brinckerhoff worked on the Tren Urbano rail project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which was projected to cost $1 billion and enjoy high ridership. Instead, it sustained a 113% cost overrun and had actual ridership only 27% of the original forecast for 2010. A new 5.5% tax was enacted partly because of unforeseen rail costs.  Continue below"	0

What you have now seen was a purely political ruling.  If you want something to compare it to read over some of the Nazi German court rulings during the time the Nazis were in control of Germany.  You will be shocked at the similarities.  I sure hope we are not moving in that direction but these court rulings say that we are.  These judges have the same loyalty to their party ideology as the Nazis did to theirs and it is reflected in their rulings.  The Nazis had one judge who would scream at people and all of them attacked people for not parroting the exact party line.  Read these cases against the travel ban and then read some court opinions from Nazi Germany.  You will think they were written by the same people.  The rulings are different but the rationale is the same.  I am not calling them Nazis, at least not yet.  However, they rationalize their rulings with their ideology in the same fashion as the Nazis rationalized theirs. Be warned.	0

Exactly Mr. Matt. It is US corporate law that CEO/CFOs must maximize profits or they can be sued for negligence by shareholders and the Big Three oil top dogs seem to be doing a bang up job of protecting the profits. On the other hand legislators are sworn to guide the state by the Alaska Constitution which mandates that they maximize the value of OUR resources. The current crop of legislators dominated by the GOP majority caucus seem to not remember that oath they swore upon taking office and are more influenced by a strange idea that their job is to also protect the profits of the oil industry.

The idea of insurance is that you pay something all along so it's there if and when illness or injury strikes. Being able to dive into a policy the day you're diagnosed is not the way it should work and by necessity must result in higher premiums for everybody."	0

The Honorable Mr. Scalise was openly against human trafficking.  This is the horrible secret that the DC and Hollywood elite want to hide.  It is worse than your worst nightmare.  Dr. Phil covered one victim on his March 21, 2017 show.  You would have a hard time listening to this evil, I know.  However, it permeates the elite, with their occult practices.  Google MOCA 2011 for pictures of the public exhibition that these people make.  Any halftime show at the Superbowl is another one of their sick and twisted rituals.  They are proud of what they do.  They are better than the rest of us, so they don't care.  It is used to keep them in line.  I believe that more than one man was part of this attempted murder, and that someone inside gave this guy the schedule of the baseball game and who would be playing.  I do not believe the media, bc you lied to me about JFK, and 911, and more.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  You won't fool me again.	1
"There WERE a lot of subsidies to the oil and gas industry from our Federal government.  They were mostly introduced in either the 1970's (presumably in response to OPEC and the like) or 1990's (presumably due to low oil prices?).  However almost all of those have either been eliminated or are in the process of being eliminated.  Starting in 2007 the Federal government began phasing out every subsidy to oil and gas companies and by the 2013 budget they had basically set out a schedule to phase all of them out.  There are still some Provincial subsidies to oil and gas companies.  Keep in mind that oil and gas is not alone here, there are subsidies to a LOT of companies.  Manufacturing gets lots of subsidies, tech companies get subsidies out the wazzoo, ""green energy"" companies are heavily subsidized, etc.  In recent years only oil and gas subsidies have been targeted to be eliminated."	0

You can try to justify your vote for Trump by belittling Democrats, (you could certainly have backtracked back to Bush years if you were looking for root causes), and honestly your reason is Better than some!   But since our massively arrogant President must claim all things as his personal accomplishment, I hope you also assign all failures to him as well.      Not because it's fair (no president can be separated entirely from previous US policy), but I hope you pick a date when Trump DOES take responsibility for current policy.	0

"Probably someone else has touched on this, but haven't read all comments .... this poll is questionable:  METHODOLOGY: The Angus Reid Institute conducted an online survey from July 7-10 among a representative randomized sample of 1521 Canadian adults who are members of the Angus Reid Forum.  SO an ""in house"" randomized sample.  Also - the questions: Which statement comes closest to your own view?  The Trudeau government  did the right thing by settling the case and offering an apology and $10.5 in compensation. (29%)  The Trudeau government did the wrong thing - it should have fought the case and left it to the courts to decide whether Khadr was wrongfully imprisoned. (71%)  Loaded questions and I'm not sure ""left it to the courts"" was even an option after the 2010 Supreme Court decision that decided exactly that - in Khadr's favour  http://angusreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017.07.11-KhadrFinal.pdf"	0

"The US timber industry accusing Canada of subsidizing their public timber sales is a classic example of ""the pot calling the kettle black"". Public timber sales are also heavily subsidized in the United States.  The Register Guard's editorial says: ""Real fairness would require that Canadian timber be sold at auction to the highest bidder. Such a process would allow prices to accurately reflect the market value of timber, while also accounting for such factors as distance to markets, the quality of the timber and labor costs — as occurs in the United States. ""  ""Competitive bidding"" for federal timber in the United States is a timber corporation controlled exercise in unfair collusion and collaboration resulting in most federal timber being sold for a third of the real market value to a few large corporations.  When total direct and indirect federal timber sale costs are tallied, our timber is being sold for an even smaller fraction of real value."	0

"More sola scriptura.

Our Courageous Bishops, filled to the brim with the Holy Spirit that selected them to lead the Church have shown us that humility, compassion, turning the other cheek, doing good to our enemies, all those ""gospel"" ideas, are not necessarily relevant to the Church in the 21st Century (and haven't been relevant to the Church throughout much of its history).  Our Bishops supported the President's campaign because he, like them, is a fighter and will wage merciless war on his enemies, and restore the religious freedoms so recently stripped from Christians in the US, as Jesus would want.  Or maybe the Bishops were wrong?  NO, that can't be it, they are God's Chosen Leaders."	0

"Someone is assuming that ""coherent, constructive policies"" result from Federal (or even State or Local) governments.  There is little evidence to support such an assumption.

I can show you one.    It is NOTHING like that which the New York Times writes about.  They are obviously a biased source.  Which is fine.  Every reporter and news outlet has a bias.  But they can be wrong.    You told me you won't listen to Gavin explain the lawsuits and how media outlets have printed lies about him.  The Proud Boys are multi-racial.  The New York Times suggested they were white only.  Which is empirically false.  Gavin has multi-racial children.  He is fine with non-whites, homosexuals and Muslims joining his group.

So-called “free trade” agreements have decimated entire industrial communities throughout Canada.  The Council of Canadians reports that over half a million jobs have been lost due to corporate trade agreements like NAFTA.  If we really want trade agreements that create jobs, defend workers’ rights and protect our environment, we need FAIR trade that puts those concerns first.  Sid Ryan believes that the NDP and the labour movement can lead the struggle against CETA and the TPP, and ensure that fair trade, not “free trade,” actually creates jobs, raises living standards and protects our water, air quality and ecosystems, for all Canadians and future generations.  http://www.sidryanforndp.ca/sid-ryan-calls-fair-trade-not-free-trade/	0

Canada1,  Alberta STILL contributes to equalization. Ever with our deficits we still send more revenue to Ottawa than we receive in services.  Alberta is OWED that EI money. Again, we pay far more into the EI pool than we receive in services.  Almost every penny of the 1.8 billion in oil and gas subsidies are PROVINCIAL subsidies for construction of value added services like Upgraders and Refineries. There are also provincial exploration tax deferment credits. You can't do squat about these. Trudeau is already phasing out the federal exploration subsidies which are minuscule.	0

I understand that reaction to the Civil system. It's easy to get on the wrong side of them too.   I said I was tired of being called racist, you said it wasn't racism it was heartlessness. Something I'm never accused of by those who know me. I have tutored many kids who were dreamers and I think they should be given a chance to stay. As long as they have a job or are in school, they should be given a visa for whichever applies. Not citizenship, but a chance to study or work here as a foreign national. Not sure how that makes me heartless but I've been called worse (see this thread for examples).	0
Some thoughts: 1. The church (really, its bishops) are absolutely loathe to consider even speaking up to discuss changing a practice for fear of being seen as not on the team. The church in general seems to be loathe to change anything! I think of the church as similar to the NRA--the NRA doesn't want to agree to even one tiny, reasonable possible restriction on gun laws--like not selling guns to people with documented mental health problems--for fear of cracking open the door in which a flood of additional demands might ensue. 2. To make priests sacramental ministers the church would have to admit the capabilities of professional lay people. My experience with that? I'm not working for the diocese anymore. Further, I'm a professional woman. They wanted to do things their way, whether legal or moral or not, against professional advice. Until they can get past that (my way or the  highway), don't consider lay admins.	0

There seem to be businesses from coast to coast helping foreign nationals duck the law although it does generally seem to go the other way - someone here keeps up a shadow existence for the would be immigrant, to meet their residency requirements, while the actual person is somewhere else on the planet making money. It wouldn't surprise me if there was a service going the other way, to meet the 6 month max limit on continuous residency, but, really, all they have to do is go stay overnight in the US every six months and they have met the requirement. So probably nor a lot of fraud in that particular part of the 10 year multi-entry visa.	0

He's thin-skinned, vindictive, and always taking the bait when he feels disrespected. The trail of lawsuits behind him his epic. Imagine handing this guy the keys to the US Department of Justice.   Americans, you are being conned by a con artist. Trump has no agenda other than himself. He has no policy positions. He has no principals. He contradicts himself constantly during interviews.

The President does not pass (he may not even formulate) the budget.  The legislature (Congress) is responsible for budgets.  True, Congress has been gutting tax rates for the wealthy but they are also defense hawks.  Taxation has room to change so the US is not broke, just badly (even stupidly) in debt.  What Trump (or any other politician says)  is for local consumption.  We will see what happens after private discussions.  He has already backed-off  most of his NATO rhetoric. The US has often complained loudly about other NATO members not paying their agreed-to share, including Canada.  The softwood tariff is the result of a long (seemingly endless) argument about how we manage our public lands for forestry and the timing has nothing to do with Trump.  NAFTA is the Trump issue.  As for THAAD, I expect South Korea to quietly tell Trump to pound sand, since the US are putting THAAD in place less to defend SK than to annoy both NK and especially China to make China act against NK.	0

What about if your parents came here over 20 years ago out of desperation. You've been raised as an American citizen. You get a ticket for jaywalking and now you're going to be deported to a country that isn't your home. Does that sound simple? Because that's exactly what these type of policies will do to people. That's the kind of thing that was even happening under Obama and it's absurd.   I think we need to curb illegal immigration while we find a way to incorporate the people who are already here who are contributing to society and who's employers and communities depend on them.  Nobody is pro illegal immigration. But blanket deportation is more symbolic than effective.   Just take a look at what happened in Arizona and Alabama. These types of policies didn't go so well for them. Turns out if large groups of people avoid the police crime increases. Turns out not even prisoners can fill the vacant labor forces properly. Legal citizens get hurt.  Think, and stop being indignant.	0

We should have LNG right now, and would have, but for the efforts by the oil company employee's that hold elected office in our state.	0

Correct. Speaking as a business owner, the various new Ontario labour changes make it more expensive to hire employees or to keep marginal hires. It is getting much harder to raise our prices. Also, other costs (eg. power, insurance) continue to increase. We have already decided to do more with less. Wynne knows that these policies are harmful; The Liberals are cynically reaching for votes from 'low-information' voters.  Shameful.	0

Council Chairman Ron Menor disagreed and said a majority of residents would prefer to see the project built to Ala Moana, even if it means extending the surcharge. “The reality is the city needs to come up with a funding mechanism to extend the rail line to Ala Moana,” he said.  Looks like Ron Menor is completely out of touch with reality and needs to go too.    The reality is that if HART and Mayor Caldwell and Ron Menor want to keep throwing our money into this bottomless pit, instead of making any effort to get control of HART's unaccountable and freespending ways. The struggling families who live here and work 2-4 jobs to keep food on the table and the lights on cannot continue to pay for this greed and incompetence.    There is no reason to believe things will get better and Ron Menor and Kirk Caldwell denying the reality of the mess they got the people of Oahu into is just another indication of their complete inability to manage it.	0

I have a question for you, Sammy. About a year ago, Parliament overwhelmingly passed a motion condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.  Based on your logic, this motion was inappropriate as it singles out a specific group (Israelis/Jews) as requiring special or unique attention when there are plenty of Canadian laws that protect all groups.  There are motions voted on in Parliament regularly. They happen all the time.  Why, suddenly, does THIS one matter?  I have my own opinion, but I want to hear yours.  Why are motions in support of Jews acceptable but motions in support of Muslims are not?	0

This shows Wildrose folks for who they are. I certainly don't agree with them, but they have a right to make their own policy.  This also shows the hypocrisy of claiming the two conservative parties can be crammed into a single party. To do that would be to suppress all kinds of key issues. Which begs the question, why do it? Why not run candidates strategically? Why not gather together to compromise over a coalition platform come election time? Why not take their combined seat count to the Lieutenant Governor and ask to form a government? Is it a crime to ask for honesty?  There is not a single type of Alberta Conservative. Yet, Mr. Kenny is going about telling us there is, that differences are small.  Time to retire and write your book, Mr. Kenny!	0
I agree establishing what is and isn't in the public interest is not easy. But the ombud applied the question incorrectly.  The public interest question shouldn't consider the substance of the proposal. That is a matter of opinion. The question for the ombud should have been whether a debate about the appropriateness of a particular clause in the Constitution is in the public interest, no matter which side you take on the issue. It clearly is.   I'd say the same about a debate about the death penalty. I do not believe changing the Constitution to bring back the death penalty would be in the public interest, but some people disagree. That is a matter of opinion. However, having the discussion to hash out the pros and cons is most certainly in the public interest.   By contrast, revealing that Marius Roodt is a fan of Star Trek is not in the public interest. It is entirely irrelevant, and may well have been intended to denigrate him as a stereotypical sad, lonely geek.	0
"ADN wrote: ""But he [Walker] cited lobbying from ""businesses, and business people"" that convinced him that averting a shutdown should now be the Legislature's sole focus."" .

Walker has turned his back on Alaskans in favor of business interests (I'd bet that the principles for most  of the businesses reside outside).  Yesterday, Walker castigated the House and lauded The Senate.  He did this despite the Senates failure to do much of anything - esp. compromising.

It looks like everyone here understands the risk reward associated with equities and other investment vehicles. Despite this, people can get very nervous about their money. Not everyone can tolerate the fluctuations. When seeing your principal erode by 20-30%, and yes, this will happen again, is definitely a buying opportunity.

The question isn't why did it take our senators so long, but why are so many Alaskans still defending and supporting Trump, who openly boasts about sexual assault. These aren't just 'silly words' or 'locker room talk', but an expression of his distorted worldview: women don't deserve respect, nor decency, but simply exist to be objectified, degraded, and used at men's will.   Living in the state that has had the highest number of rapes and sexual violence in the nation for many years it is incomprehensible to me why so many Alaskans still support this guy. Is 'rape-culture' really so acceptable in this state?  And 'no' bringing up all the 'wrong-doings' of Bill and/or Hillary Clinton aren't a defense of Trump's awful behavior. Two wrongs don't make a right. Don't like Hillary? Then don't vote for her! But stop defending a person who is by any objective, non-partisan standard of human decency utterly reprehensible!	0

Refugee policies have been expanded and made more generous over the decades while  it appeared western economies could afford them. Let's be clear -- only advanced modern western economies have such programs, but economic disruptions and globalized trade & outsourcing have changed those nations. It is time to identify and solve the problems in the nations from which refugees come.  People will scoff and say that western nations cannot judge other people's beliefs or cultures and tell them what to do -- BUT when those nations have problems,  either the UNHCR sets up one-way refugee transportation programs to the West, or refugees find their own way here because they WANT to have a western standard of living. Why not encourage other nations to adopt western standards 'at home'?  If they really don't want this way of life, why claim refugee status here? The UNHCR reported 66-million refugees in 2016 with more to come. Time to solve the REAL problems, not pay for more of the same.	0

Many of us who live on the lower Cook Inlet remember this somewhat differently. We observed humpback whales staying in our waters later than anyone could ever remember seeing; through September, October, into November, and many until the first of the year. There were extraordinary numbers of murres as well, staying well past the traditional time when this species would migrate from the region.  These creatures didn't linger because there was a lack of food, on the contrary, there was a tremendous amount of food, and temperatures were unseasonably warm. Those of us who took to the water (from Koyuktolic Bay to the head of Kachemak) saw tremendous balls of bait  fish.  These bait fish often leave our waters as quickly as they arrive. In less than a week's time, early November, a great preponderance of these balls of bait left the area. The murres had stayed too long. A heavy 80 knot wind hit the area and caught the birds unawares. Blowing them inland all the way to Lake Illiamna.	0

Water fluoridation is not about “dose”, nor is it about any “treatment”.  It is about the concentration level of existing fluoride in drinking water supplies at which a significantly less amount of dental infection has been observed to occur in populations served by those supplies.  Research has shown that when fluoride exists in water at a concentration of 0.7 mg/L  then those served by that supply will have significantly less dental decay, with no harm.  Correct, you cannot be harmed by normal exposure to optimally fluoridated water.  You can, however, obtain a very valuable health benefit from it.  That’s exactly the point.  At less than $1 per person, per year for fluoridation, there is no such measure which even approaches its cost-effectiveness.  Topical treatments would be astronomically more expensive, and certainly no more effective for entire populations.  Obviously, it would be fiscally Irresponsible to replace fluoridation with topical treatment.  Steven D. Slott, DDS	0

Can you list examples of actual incidences where the Hawaii GOP displayed hate and explain how these incidences qualify as hate. Can you do the same for President Trump? He's has hired a lot of people in his business. Wouldn't you think there would be a ton of complaints and lawsuits against him by his employees. By looking at the comment on this online discussion, it looks like the majority of the hate comes from the hate President Trump crowd. They say a lot of hateful things and don't back it up.

I was heartbroken to discovery this morning that the most recent pedestrian hit and run fatality was an old friend James Hawke.  James was my party chief -surveying native allotments in Unalakleet in the 70s dealing with the first female survey team (he survived the experience).   I recall trudging across the tundra with heavy packs trying to keep up with James as he seemed to effortlessly speed walk ahead of us.   I last saw and talked with James on May 19 at my granddaughters Anchorage Ballet recital.  James was a supporter and frequent attendee of the performing arts and since retirement had traveled through Europe.  James was a solitary kind man and his family (from Michigan I recall) should know he was well liked and respected by those who knew him.  I wish I had taken the time to know him better and I will miss seeing him on his walks around town.	0

He has even gone after Fox, when they point out his lies, and that unfortunately is the real problem.  I absolutely understand why Obama had a problem with Fox, but he ultimately did do interviews on Fox, even after he called them out for some of their more egregious behavior.

There is such a thing as the statute of limitations.  Absent actual, legally provable fraud, ten years is not going to work.    Is your current car insurer responsible for the accident you had  three years ago?  When you just bought the insurance yesterday?  I think not.  If you didn't bother to sue at the time of the accident and there is, say, a two-year statute of limitations, you will get nothing but the bill from your attorney.   To sue a County in Oregon, you have to file a Notice of Intent to sue a long, long time ago!	0

Well, you're no fun, Nate. First I noticed the two names almost rhyme and share a voiced first letter, an identical vowel, and a voiced consonant in the middle, then the identically sounded a and e, then the same final dental, nasal n that my last name uses, probably because my last name and his are both Norse names, likely. Maglone has all the letters with a discordant accent on the second syllable. All that of course isn't necessary, I was sort of hoping someone would come in with some new anagrams.

I seriously thought the days of jingoistic, white-washed, British boot-scraping interpretation of our history was far behind us. Although I am not of indigenous nor Franco heritage, I am a Maritimer and I am so disappointed to see the indigenous and Acadian contribution to the history of our nation so blatantly by-passed by the producers of this farce production. Where is Champlain in L’Acadie? where is Port Royal? And where is the immense and strategically  important fortress of Lousibourg? Not to mention the significance of the support provided by the Mi’kmaq to the newcomers. I can only imagine how other regions of this country have also been strategically white-washed from existence by the CBC. Why? Perhaps previous commenters have provided the explanation – a Harper appointed CBC board? Perhaps. But the bias of this pathetic Anglo-centric production evokes a term that I had thought long since behind me as a Maritimer – Upper Canadian! There I’ve said it!	0

Tim Hudak  & the real estate agents he represents appear to be saying the collectively standing aside and letting the real estate bubble in Greater Toronto & contiguous areas (& presumably BC's GVRD & contiguous areas) expand ever faster thereby becoming ever more unstable (& residential real estate further beyond the reach of a widening array of potential buyers) is somehow in the interests of potential buyers, especially first time ones.

I certainly don't claim that everyone is responsible. But my main points are:  A) The statistics support that the vast majority of users have no interest in deliberately violating the laws, or anyone's privacy, and are merely trying to fly safely and have fun.  B) These proposed changes will do little to stop those that are the real threat. (more than the existing legislation already provided).  Your example of the annoying neighbor kid is a great example. If they were hovering that close to your house/vehicle/etc, that's clearly wrong, and reckless behavior. Also if they were actually flying it in a way that was spying on you (keep in mind, just because it's a drone hovering somewhere, doesn't mean it's spying on you). But in that event, also wrong, and in violation of your privacy.  Old legislation: You call the cops, they come, they tell them to put the drone away, on repeat offenses, they would apply charges and/or confiscate  New Changes: Most likely exact same reaction/outcome...	0

"Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan I believe is correct in that acknowledges America has lost much of the ""Greatness"" that was once rightly attributed to America.  No reasonable and knowledgeable person can take Hillary or the Democrat party at her/their word.    ""Today I want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault,"" Clinton said. ""Don't let anyone silence your voice. You have the right to be heard. You have the right to be believed."" [Hillary Clinton, September 14, 2015]  In light of the facts of Bill's record of infidelity, the indisputable history of Hillary's personal character assignations and harassment of some 30 plus women victimized by Bill, not to mention Bills [sic] actions with under age females with his friend Epstein.  Trumps locker room language merits no defense. But for the left to demonize Trump and give Bill and Hillary support and a pass amounts to juvenile impetuous hypocrisy by the wanton post-American/anti-American democrat party."	1

After demanding a pledge of loyalty to the GOP from Trump, the GOP has shown anything but loyalty to the duly elected president. They fight, bicker and oppose everything he does. So going to the democrats to get something done that's good for the country makes perfect sense.

Mr Davis-  While what happened w/ the NBPP voter intimidation case is pretty ratty and weird  it was not a presidential pardon which is what the other gentleman was saying. Charges were dropped , there was never a trial  so there was never a conviction so there could not be a pardon. It was not clear why the Bush DOJ dropped its original investigation then  another arm picked it up and certainly not clear why the Obama DOJ dismissed charges. It does seem pretty clear that voters left the poll involved as they felt intimidated by those creeps.   But I hope we stay clear about what happened and don't start one of those urban legend dealies about Mr Obama pardoning the NBPP as a thank you for voting for him- didn't happen.	0

"This is certainly a challenging time for any illegal's who came and now have family with school age children. I wonder if the young students who fear deportation are from those households. I imagine the illegal status of one or both parents must be a closely held secret within the household. I don't know what these parents, if illegal, shared  with the children. They knew there was a risk of being caught and deported but decided to take the chance not knowing how long they could stay. This is a crossroads and how are they going to address it. This discussion should be going on at home so the child underdtands what the family plan is.  We all know that campaign ""promises"" are generally not delivered. I imagine there will be a ""wall"" that increases the security significantly, not a literal wall but increased manpower along the border, etc. Mass deportations, no, but requirements to remain.

This leads to what is missing. While they seem regressivie, consumption taxes are better than payroll taxes and lower wage income taxes because they tax profit and wages equally and allow tax benefits to families to be distributed through wages as an offset to consumption tax collected. They are the money machine that makes European style social democracy possible, from real health care to family subsidies. The GOP will not even consider them. This goes way beyond prudential judgement to economic immorality. You simply cannot vote for this party. As an issue, abortion is about allowing rather than imposing. The GOP economic plan is imposing a corrupt system and it encourages abortion because it leaves many with only the option of killing the additional child. Again, DiNardo, call your office.	0

"""Sometimes, if the church finds the priest guilty of abuse but he refuses to cooperate with church authorities, there is no recourse but to defrock him. But by consigning him to a monastery, far from children, those authorities can make sure he is never again placed in a situation where he might abuse children. If the priest refuses to accept and abide by the terms set for his being monitored, the church's authorities will reopen the case, send it back to the doctrinal congregation, and he can be defrocked. This is akin to house arrest, and if he violates the terms, he can still be removed from the clerical state.""  There are a lot of ""ifs"" in this statement, both literally and substantively. As a practical matter, bishops are ill equipped to monitor offenders effectively. Monasteries aren't prisons, and the coming and going of every resident are not tracked 24/7. Monasteries don't want to be jailers. It is unreasonable to ask bishops to do what they lack the capacity to do."	0

Yes, that is my point. The “soft sounding” parts of scripture describe love, which can be filled with great hardships.  Marriage is a place where people commit to suffering with Jesus for the sake of another person. It may sound soft, because its purpose is wonderful, an act of love and being loved. But hopefully every Christian knows love has many crosses that accompany the grace. But why are you saying this as if you disagree with me? Remarried people can have marriages that reflect love brightly, bearing burdens that unmarried people would not consider. Bearing them happily because the blessings are so much greater than pain of the cross.  Assuming the duties of marriage and children is so much better than staying alone, shaken by the pain of the first marriage and afraid to try again. Neiher is an easy path, but loving seems like the better choice.	0

If I was a politically insane person like so many in this forum, I would say leave to Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Congress for putting these men in those conditions during clean up.  But in all fairness, this case, the blame fall directly on the US Government and their dysfunctional health care system called the VA.  Surely even the most dense can connect the dots between what these men are suffering and the work that they did during clean up. At least they can do is to pick up the tab for medical care.

"Different sickness, I would guess, but quite severe in any case. I am generally on the side of not diagnosing someone at a distance, and public figures, particularly, are a bit more difficult obviously. No one has enough information at a distance.  First, off, the term ""neurosis"" isn't in much use these days, but fits more the diagnoses of personality disorders. The markers for psychosis are hallucinations and delusions, often, as you said. It does seem, from reports, that Trump is not a drinker, as you mentioned, which can lead to hallucinations and such. Substance abuse, use, or not, is not known, and there are times, such as the first debate, when there was reason to wonder if he was using one or more substances. We don't know that. No hallucinations that we know of, and the delusions, lies, whatever seem more connected to him seeming to have a narcissistic personality disorder.

Boy, it sure looks like certain refugees and immigrants, mostly uppity muslims, are creating a real $ hit storm in Canada, especially in the Toronto area and within the school boards. They certainly are not assimilating into Canadian society very peacefully, are they? Should we tolerate their demands or drum them out of town? And how does any of this bad behavior actually benefit Canada?   I was under the impression that religion was something that was supposed to be practised at the home and place of worship. Why is religion still being allowed in public circles? It's a private matter, not one for the public to be exposed to.  This IS a direct result of the same can of worms that Bill Davis opened up in 1968 and these problems can be directly linked to his decision. Promotion of a separate catholic school board. WORST decision EVER!! It simply opened the flood gates. Just look at the $ hit it has caused. Shame on you Bill Davis, where-ever you are, you are the master of this disaster.	0

"""CU staff have won four Nobel prizes since Cech won in 1989."" Yet the comment from peterpi made no mention and seemed to be unaware of this fact again demonstrating that sports receives the lions share of media attention. Try as you might you will be unable to support the contention that the University receives attention for non-sports areas in any thing approaching the media attention sports garners. Again the irony of attempting to dispute my comment on an article related to CU sports is unavoidable. Even the tragic coverage of Rasham Saalam's untimely death likely received more media attention than CU fingerprints on the Hubble mission and Mars Maven. Why because Mr. Saalam was a former CU sport star, sadly without that link little or no mention would have been made. The Hubble telescope has received tremendous media coverage, CU's part in the mission is rarely a focal point of the mission's coverage."	0

I think the good Dr. is mixing up the wrong diagnosis with the wrong treatment. Two wrongs do not make a right. If doctors are underpaid, over-worked, etc. (although many who see the cars they drive, the houses they live in, the cottages  and ski condos they own, the vacations they take might argue they are doing fairly well), then improve that part of the equation. To ask that a Dr. be able to share his/her income with a non-working spouse and adult children is absurd to say the least when an employed person cannot do that. The proposed tax on passive income is a bit more debatable. Some of these small business corporations do use passive investments to save for business expansion and other capital upgrades (although I doubt that is why most Dr's do it).  When all of these juicy and special tax treatments of income earned by small business corporations were brought in, it was to encourage business expansion, not so that Dr's could pay less tax. Return it to what was intended.	0
"oxtail01 makes a very important point, especially for a Hawaii Republican politician.  One of the things I just DO NOT UNDERSTAND, is why the Hawaii GOP has not come out with a full throated statement condemning racism and hate speech, as well as White Supremacists, Nazis and the KKK.  It's a no brainer.  So, I wonder why.  WHY doesn't the Hawaii GOP come out with a statement condemning?  WHY?  Maybe it wants to continue to be what it is.  Maybe it is satisfied with (what is it?) NO Senators in the Hawaii Senate.  Maybe it's comfortable without a Republican in the Gov's office.  If Djou, Aiona, Slom or Ward are thinking about running for a big seat in 2018, they really SHOULD make a condemnation statement.  ON that number Fukumoto occupies a higher plain.  She was probably an easy contender for a big seat under the GOP in 2018, if she wanted to pursue it.  Her move to leave made clear ""there are some things even politicians won't do"".  And, she's saying what GOP pols SHOULD do."	0

Hi George, nice to see somebody asking for more info rather that automatically bashing comments. The US Department of Energy has a very good database of these types of contracts. Page 51 provides a nice summary.  https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/08/f33/2015-Wind-Technologies-Market-Report-Presentation.pdf You can see most PPAs are signed at between $US 20 and 30 dollars per MWh (2 to 3 cents per kWh).  Even if you remove all the incentives, these projects are a fraction (usually 3 to 4 cents kWh) of where most retail power prices currently are. You are right to point out that firm sources are required for backup, and that is why most advanced power markets also have a capacity market to properly compensate these kind of facilities. The transition from where we are today to a power system with between 30 and 40 percent renewables is relatively simple. Buy very cheap wind and solar in the energy market while CCGTs sell both energy and capacity. Cheers	0

"If Bernie supporters stayed home in Cali because the much-hated press called the much-hated  Hillary the winner prematurely, then I guess they weren't as serious about the election as they claimed.    Truth is:  Our system reflects the will of tbe body politic.    Trump supporters and Bernie supporters love being ""outsiders"" who will smash the status quo - but when the reality of being on the fringes results in an election loss, suddenly the system is rigged and they were cheated.   Maybe the status quo is tired of being blamed for the inability of some people to stay committed to their desire for change by working tirelessly their whole lives to gain even small progress.  Maybe the status quo is wary of stringently idealistic and  hateful people, with no applicable skills or plans, who demonize those tireless people for being practical in order to actually accomplish something."	0

"Well spoken. For clarification, I believe Adolph Hitler didn't target Catholics as he did Jews and the other minorities in Europe.  Hitler exterminated 6 to 9 million people in death camps alone and in his failed attempt to conquer the Soviet Union, killed 20 million Russians.  Hitler finally committed suicide when the Red Army invaded Berlin in 1945, aided by the Allies. It is the KKK in this country that detests Catholics as much as African-Americans and Jews.  That is why symbols, flags, monuments, and tributes to the Confederacy are loved by the ""Imperial Wizards"". The KKK, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, white supremacists (euphemistically called the alt-right) all base their doctrine of hate and bigotry on the premise of racial purity and superiority. Sadly, these groups seem to be getting more popular in America lately."	0

People saying that cats barely kill birds are delusional, of course they do, I've held 100's of broken, torn apart bodies in my own hands, ask any wildlife Rehabilitator and they will confirm it also.  Camera studies have proven that cats kill on average 3-5 kills a week, who knows how high the numbers are of infected with toxo wild animals and how many lives are lost to it.  They are no meant to live in the Eco system and they are damaging it, enough already. Usfw needs to enforce the migratory bird treaty and get these killers out of the environment.	0

"@Ruben Reyes says:  ""`Potential' and `May be using' implies a hypothesis that can lead to all sorts of things an anti-Trump person can invent to demonize Trump.""   Yes, that is one possible outcome.  Another possible outcome: a test of the hypothesis reveals evidence that Trump does indeed have ties to Russia and/or his family is profiting from the presidency.  KellyAnne Conway's brazen hawking of Ivanka Trump's merch certainly indicates the Trump family's eye to profit.    And Trump's own warm words about Putin contrast strongly with his treatment of the American judicial system, the FBI, and our nation's free press.  In my view, the actions of Conway and Trump are consistent with and lend plausibility to the hypothesis.  Still, the hypothesis might be false.  Hopefully, we'll see."	0

Religious misogyny once was the bane of women, in early 20th century, Once we got religion off the woman's back and out of government women starting succeeding outside of home and pursuing their dreams.

Thankfully the women today who decide not to marry, of are single by whatever reason are not beholden to nasty relatives, and pity of society by being forced to beg on the streets as is the case in many religious dominated countries today.	0
"About 10 years ago I gave a renewable energy / climate change presentation at the Social Movement's Indaba, painting a picture of a future in which ubiquitous public transport would be powered by electricity, methane, hydrogen and other alternatives, in which decent homes would have solar power, batteries, off-grid options and where the standard of living would be vastly improved. The reaction from certain members of the audience was textbook indoctrination. No they said. We don't want this, free enterprise, capitalist future. What they ""the masses"" wanted was the stark bureaucracy pictured in Soviet paintings from the Brezhnev era.

All 50 states award good-time to prisoners for not rioting, for not beating each other to death, and otherwise for not tearing up our prisons and costing excessive expense.  When a reasonably well behaved prisoner is released, that good-time is theirs, and they hit the streets free and clear, not counting any residual probation time ... except in Alaska and two other states.  Alaska's Mandatory Parole scheme keeps a prisoner released to their earned good-time on a leash that says that they can be returned to prison for any little thing that makes their PO nervous.  Whereas, if they had been vested in their good-time, as 47 other states do, they could be returned to prison only for committing a new crime.  Some Mandatory Parole violations include drinking only one beer, sleeping at a friends house overnight, or attending church without permission (honest, this is true).  By simply vesting prisoners in their earned good-time, we could reduce recidivism, and expense, by a huge amount.	0

Dr.Komorowski, firstly, the state legislature did NOT expand Medicaid. The governor did. How factual are your other comments if you cannot get even this basic fact straight? Secondly, who/what is responsible for the current opioid epidemic? Could doctors and the medical profession be the root cause? Over prescribing? Seems as if the medical profession is causing a problem that it wants to solve with taxpayers' money. Educate people, train people, get them skilled so they can get and keep jobs. Do NOT take away their self-worth and dignity. The government cannot give them those.	0

Congratulations to the voters who recognized and accepted the responsibility of residents of the city to build and maintain the schools, libraries and public play and recreation spaces in the community. It speaks well of Anchorage and her voters that ensuring the common good exceeds selfish personal interests.   It is unfortunate that the four conservative former mayors of Anchorage fought so hard and successfully to reject the additional bond proposal. Neoliberal austerity as advocated by conservatives nationally is counterproductive in the long term. I certainly hope that none of those four or any of the people who they convinced to vote no are never in an unmet need for ambulance or other services that would have been funded by the bonds.	0

"[It is impossible to check the facts.] That doesn't seem to even slow down 4AK's defense of the oil companies.  While we have reports about last years profits (What was it - $100 million in Alaska and one of only two places in the world that turned a profit?) which we are just supposed to disregard when they announce their quarterly earnings?  I don't remember their costs to produce oil changing here in Alaska under any legislative act so that makes it feel more like an educated guess.  I don't know about you but I tend to find numbers based upon records over unsubstantiated claims of ""They pay WAY more in State of Alaska taxes than they make here"" so it is only fair to ask for some corroborative evidence."	0

"curious -  Are all DPS schools funded the same $ per student ? Do the better preforming schools get more $/student ? Is the ONLY difference between these better school from the bottom ones the number of minorities - seems odd.. If funding is the same - a curriculum is the same (DPS) - then why are the schools similar in results? Parental involvement ?  Just asking questions -- Don't have answers ---  But I have always thought - parental involvement and ""expectations"" at all ages - Schools help with expectations -- had allot to do with teat results ---  Anyone ??  Out"	0
If anyone looked at a course load in schools they would realize that there just isn't room in the curriculum for this. It could perhaps be incorporated under history, but history is optional so you would be reaching a small group of students.Then you have the content, as in who vets the content. Is it going to airbrushed so that it is politically clean, or is it going to present the whole picture, warts and all. In 2011 there was a report released of a government investigation that spent over a million investigating the incidents of abuse at these schools. There were 5300 hundred suspects identified, which far exceeded the staff. Turns out the students were also abusers as well, which may explain how abuse was carried on in reserves after the schools were closed. Only 50 people were ever charged as the government couldn't find people to testify. If you are going to teach about residential schools, then you must tell the whole story.	0

I remember a similar question in high school religion class -- the question was about someone who committed murder.

There are many different versions of lu`au or laulau stew.  Hawaiian Style Cafe in Kamuela used to serve an onolicous version... not sure if they still do.  The recipe here is similar to he`e or moa lu`au, substituting the he`e or moa with beef.  Another similar dish is laing, although that is usually made with dried taro leaf. I usually make lu`au stew without the coconut milk, with fatty pork or beef (or both), and add a little chunk of salt butterfish or some patis, although sometimes I add the coconut milk if get extra from something else. Instead of taro chunks, I use poi for thickener... like for poi stew.	0
"Regarding: ""Sheridan quoted former CUA President Bishop David O'Connell as saying, ""I would argue there is more academic freedom at a Catholic university than at a secular university."""" - This is a good baseline for determining if the university is catholic: is there academic freedom, is there anything inhibiting it  at a catholic university? - So, if a university (professors, staff, students, and alumni) are aware that academic freedom is being attacked, or worse, has decamped from the university, then that university is not catholic. - With this in mind one may recall that the stance of Bishop John (D'arcy), formerly of Fort Wayne - South Bend (RIP) as an attack on academic freedom (plays, speakers, etc... he expected that as bishop he would have to vet these people and events) which in the end had little effect on Univ of ND and thus the Univ of ND is still an academy where intellectual freedom thrives in the environment of catholic faith."	0

You are kidding, right? State employees work for the Government that ONLY generates money from oil revenues and tax payer money. If they worked for the private sector that generates a profit, I'd be supportive. When a private sector company can't generate enough profit or revenue to pay their employees, they lay them off. We need to start reducing the numbers on our State payrolls by reducing hiring and providing an early retirement incentive.	0
"Simple Bull_Bear, rates are high due entirely to the green energy contracts McGuilty thought were such a good idea.  I looked into this several years ago.  I wanted to put solar panels on my roof and sell the power under a 20 year contract, back to Hydro One.  Under the terms of the contract, I would have been guaranteed 80 cents per KwH.  At the time, Hydro One was selling electricity to consumers at 8 cents per KwH.  That means they would have bought my power for a premium of 72 cents per Kwh.  Do the math on that one.   Furthermore, there are in excess of 1,000 wind turbines in OntariOWE. Wynne says they can produce 1,350 mega watts.  True, but the operative word is ""can"".  On average, they produce 300 mega watts (see IESO website and review spot supply and demand).  One nuclear steam generator produces 800 mega watts consistently, whereas all the wind turbines, costing the same as a reactor, produce less than half of that. That is why the price is so high!"	0

The pathway to unity will probably require an all-encompassing, inclusive council of primates/patriarchs of the entire “holy, catholic, and apostolic church”.  While living in Bulgaria, I encountered a widespread perception that the Russian Orthodox church has become the Third Rome, displacing Constantinople, which had previously been the New Rome.  There appears to be a lot of eastern church history behind these notions of leadership (i.e. “first among equals”).    A year ago, four of the fourteen patriarchates (i.e. Antioch, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Russia) boycotted the pan-orthodox council assembled in Crete by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.   Hence, his effort to hold a modern council could not come to full fruition.	0

The total units being built is 533, so I think you were referring to one tower. The adverse impact on the neighborhood lies in that not all residents will have off street spaces for their cars.

No, I am asserting that the fact that it was a property crime makes the traditionalist inclusion of all other sexual sins with it unscriptural and wrong.  Just more truthspeak because there was no other way to include them as serious sin. This is why Pius IX and Pius X did not like scriptural scholarship, because it showed these little abuses of truth.  Fornication was also a property crime, by the way, if your daughter was a commodity to be married off.  At least Paul got that one right and stated that Fornication was a sin against one's own body (and soul), which it is. It is not adultery.  News flash on biblical sexuality - it is very similar to the Honor Killing mentality in Afghanistan today and those other places practicing radical Islam.  I hope we have outgrown that silliness.	0

"I'm as progressive as anyone. But I don't support this ""identity politics"" stuff. That's a way to divide the people, not unite them. The problem of America and most of the world isn't so much a man-woman divide or a black-white divide, or a gay-straight divide. It is a middle class have - working class have not divide.   The women's movement at this time, the whole array of Democratic Party and CNN protests - they are all a big fat red herring.   The only way to unite America and bridge the dangerous divide in Europe is for the middle class to support the working class, as they did in the 1960's.   We need to support the Bernie Sanders political revolution to transform the economy. That way women, blacks, Latinos, and gays will all benefit from more equality. The same old same old identity politics, ignoring the real issue of classism is the way to ensure people are divided, the 1% continue to enrich themselves, and the  middle class voting block remains a shill for the status quo."	0

The analysis suggests to me that we aren't going to see $100+ per barrel for oil again any time soon.  Supply will be good.  And even with increasing demand in other parts of the world, the move to technologies that reduce our reliance on oil will dampen demand to some extent.  The oil companies that will do well in the coming years are those that are good at containing costs.	0

Huge changes are ahead for the automobile. Most Americans, and to some extent, Eugene's draft Transportation System Plan, do not take this into account. The TSP largely overlooks driverless cars, for example.  This oversight is a missed opportunity to influence how driverless cars will become used in Eugene and overlooks innovative solutions to today's transportation problems made possible by technology advances. Driverless cars can lead either to increased or decreased traffic. Future city laws can be envisioned that discourage vehicle parking and limit time durations when a driverless car is unoccupied. Such laws may seem strange now when individual car ownership is the norm. However, they can promote shared use of driverless cars and entrepreneurial opportunities. They reduce the need to own a car, make available land now used for parking, and allow roadway reconfigurations to better accommodate pedestrians and bicycles.	0

There are many things a President CAN'T do without the support of the majority.

I think what you're saying is that there were no statutory requirements to clean up until the 1990s.  There were legal ones based upon the common law.

Eugene also has an abatement law on the books. My neighbors and I put it to use and had a happy ending, although the property was never abated.

With a little help from one of EPD's staff (he's the only one who has lived in our neighborhood in decades and his sister lives right down the street), we got a letter threatening a one year abatement sent to the owner. He promptly fired the manager and evicted the meth dealers, which solved the problem.  The happy ending came just a few years later when NEDCO approached the owner about turning the property into low-income housing for young people aging out of foster care. He promptly sold the property to NEDCO, which used HUD funds from the city. We now have several nice young people in affordable housing, a win all around.	0

I also thought of the Amazon Park project after reading this story. $1 million for a park renovation seems like a bargain compared to $8 million for a parking lot. Maybe that's what the city parks people want us to think. They and other public agencies can always count on LTD to make them look good. I will say that I would rather have 8 overpriced $1 million parks than 1 extremely overpriced $8 million parking lot. For $8 million the parking lot should include water slides and changing rooms for some recreation, and perhaps a branch library for those who are less active, while you wait for the bus.	0
Oh I have no doubt that many did. The (R) nomination was wide-open for the first month (with a whopping 17 candidates in the race all diluting each other's votes).  And the (D) nomination was considered a slam dunk for Hillary for a year leading up to the primaries, and through the first month of them.    It wasn't until March 5 (about 20 primaries into the race) that it suddenly started becoming a race on the (D) side, when Bernie surprised with 5 primary wins that week.  By then, Trump had taken control of the (R) delegate count by winning most of the early states, most of which were open primaries.  Nearly all the national focus was on the (R) side for that first month, anxious to see who would face Hillary in the general election.	0

Arenado isn't a Hall of Famer, because he's still playing. The two previous seasons, he led the NL in home runs and rbi's. The former Orioles great 3rd baseman Robinson has said he only watches three players, and Arenado is one of them. I remember watching George Brett and Mike Schmidt play the position and Arenado's their equal, to me.   Last year's splits were closer. Yet, most players likely have better home stats than road stats.  Using your logic, Clayton Kershaw is a product of Chavez Ravine. A pitcher's park, at sea level. And at Coors Field, he pitches like a Rockies pitcher here. How does he end up in the Cy Young mix?	0

Yes, actually it is a defense.  By changing the subject to those purportedly falsely accused, you change the subject from the Church's long-term, international protection of pedophile priests.  Changing the subject is one of the Church's favorite tactics to defend its indefensible aiding and abetting of child abuse.  By doing this you join the Church in defending pedophiles.  Certainly not all pedophiles, only those in clerical garb.	0

"The Trump administrators have publicly spoke of ""not spending any public money on climate change"" that is a clear signal that the federal government will have a ""see no climate change"" attitude that will lead America into a 19th century stance of exploiting fossil fuels rather than a 21st stance of coming to terms with anthropogenic climate change.  The Trump budget blue print shows that there is major reductions to relevant agencies in charge of climate change research like NASA and NOAA.  Other executive orders include the cutting of research by the Department of Defense's green energy programs that would use biofuels for jets, helicopters, tanks, etc. because the US military is the largest consumer of fossil fuels in the world."	0

"I have not denied any of Trump's depolorable rhetoric; as I've said before several times - I voted for Clinton. But you just keep hurling these insults at voters who elected the guy & pretend that the policies that the GOP has pushed are simply A-OK or unrelated.  The GOP was in serious trouble before Trump ever ran, & had he lost the election, would still be in trouble because the policies have been stale & shop-worn.  As for Ryan, while I like some his proposals, I've lost a lot o respect for him after his pussy-footing ""non-endorsement/endorsement"" of Trump. He showed himself to me be a feckless leader unwilling to have the courage to say ""no."" He has proven himself worthy of many of the criticisms hurled at him: as someone who wants to be taken seriously as a political figure, but ultimately unwilling to pay any sort of price to get there. And so far as you whitewash or ignore his own role in creating this mess, then I'm afraid you are missing the underlying challenge for the GOP."	1

"Alley Valkyrie, who had extensive experience with homeless people when she lived here, has written that homeless people are no better and no worse than the housed. Housed people can hide their problems in their homes, while the homeless, or at least a small fraction of them, are out in public for everyone to see.   The only thing that homeless people have in common is that they don't have enough money to get into an apartment. Most are homeless temporarily and just need shelter and other services while they're homeless. Experience in other cities has shown that even the minority of chronically homeless can be successfully housed, under a ""housing first"" policy, with subsidized apartments and the right support services, and it actually saves money.  As for ""choices"", the problem is that there are so few good ones available to the poor, often none. Middle-class people can get away with a lot that the poor can't, because they have money."	0
On some level, this is about defining Donald Trump. Some want to define him as racist, xenophobic, against all religions except Christianity, etc. Trump himself has always claimed he is not. If Trump really was, I think he'd let you know it. The fact that he works with Muslim and Jewish leaders overseas is more consistent with Trump's claims than his accusers. The Supreme Court ruling may not be the end of this issue. The Appeals court overturned the Hawaii court's prohibition against the government reviewing and updating the Visa program. If the Visa program is now revised with new rules, will Chin file another lawsuit halting the revisions? That would depend on what the revisions are, and what the Supreme Court rules on.	0

"""Then there is Dr Thomas Pogge, who suggests a global resources dividend (GRD) whereby current and historical injustices against the global poor are counteracted through the modest taxation of global natural resources – including fossil fuels, land used for farming, mining and destroyed habitats – and redistributing the levy amongst those involuntarily excluded from their use. All of these proposals (and dozens more) fall under the umbrella of UBI.  ""The most important distinguishing feature between the different iterations of UBI is where the funding comes from.

"No, the problem in this case was the judge's interpretation of mens rea, whether the accused knew that what he was doing was wrong.  Given that the only point y'all have fixated on is ""women lie"" I do think Victimitis is right about the board being full of bitter divorced men."	1
The only way cutting corporate taxes would ever help the working man/woman is if there was a stipulation that the total and exact amount saved by the employer/corporation from the previous year was required, by law, to go into increased wages for the employees.  Otherwise most employers will just rake in bigger profit margins.  Very few would actually put that money back into the business itself.  When the Greed Over People (GOP) talks about trickle down economics, it isn't income that trickles down to the common man.	0
"""Silk reminds Catholics that the problem of disaffiliation is not confined to Catholics. Evangelicals and their mainline Protestant cousins also suffer from defections.""  Although he's correct in saying that Catholics and mainline Protestant churches have been losing membership, he's wrong to say the same about evangelical churches. The Pew polls showed them staying level and nort declining.  What is a similarity between the RCC and mainline Protestant churches that doesn't exist in evangelical churches? The former have been moving away from traditional teachings (at least under Francis), whereas the latter have mostly stuck to the fundamentals. As the article points out, there maybe other factors involved, but this might be one of the more significant."	0

Huh!  Justin is responsible for taking care of Canadians and Canadian jobs? If so, what's Justin's record of standing up for Canada's resource economy? Or does he just wilt under persistent obstructionism from British Columbia? Just as I suspect he will wilt if forced to stand up to Saudi Arabia?  In BC, pipelines weren't even discussed when Trudeau met the new BC premier, despite the new BC premier's vows to kill the federally approved Transmountain pipeline, even though it would lie just metres away from a pre-existing pipeline.    If Justin can't stand up to the premier of British Columbia, and defend Canada's resource industry, then what are the chances that Justin will stand up to Saudi Arabia?	0

I guess while we're at it, we're also supposed to ignore his dangerous war-mongering tweets, his refusal to address the rise of white nationalism, his historic rate of losing administration members, his gutting of federal agencies, his unstable habit of picking fights with celebrities, his efforts to detabilize businesses and industries that don't explicitly support him (like the NFL and the insurance industry), his remarkable lack of interest in helping entire regions  in distress (like Puerto Rico and Northern California), his dangerous comments regarding the first amendment, his rejection of almost universally accepted science, and his bizarre actions that have led to the alienation of our historic allies.  By all means, let's ignore all that and praise him for questionable projected results of policies he hasn't even written yet, much less passed. Yeah, that's entirely reasonable.	0

continued ; I'm calling the bog racist for their attacks on rural hunters, the only other explanation I can see is that the  urban Wildlife Protection folks(not you Simieon) cant tell the front leg of a boned out moose from a rear leg. The caribou head rule gives them away, if they could figure out how to make it stick they, bog, would make rural residents go back to the spear, without the atle. I can understand that folks in urban areas want to hunt and fish, they live in ALASKA too, I have no solution, unit 13 hunting is the same as the Kenia salmon allocation between commercial gear groups, sport fishermen, tourists, guides and again subsistence. Where are the subsistence folks lobbying groups as opposed to the Alaska Outdoor Council, Alaska Professional Hunters Association, commercial fishing lobbyists  and urban voters?

@ sirencall  I've read several of your posts re: historical timelines and I say without malice, you have a very poor historical education. The British Empire did not 'bumble' in Asia and 'discover' gunpowder.   The fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 is the true debut of gunpowder's ultimate brutality on the battlefield. However, prior to Byzantium's decay. The Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavid Empires are the true historical 'Gunpowder Empires' of history.   The Mughal's would conquer and influence Afghanistan, through the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. The Mughals believed the had a duty from God, to convert or murder Polytheism peoples. The Safavid Empire is present day Iran and the Ottoman starts with a nomadic tribesman named Osman who was Sufi Islam.   They went on to conquer much of Europe. You do not have the rise of the Gunpowder Empires without the rise and fall of Genghis Khan.   Culture and history are the gradual amalgamations of change and influence.	0

Marty I have attempted to correspond with you sometimes seriously, other times in jest.  But my realization is that no matter whether incontrovertible evidence is provided to you it will have no affect...truth is not being sought, but a strong grip onto a belief held is a must and solely the issue, not whether it has any validity.  It is absurd to say;  Original Sin would appear in a DNA sequence...that is contrived myth.  Evolution is change over time with gradual modification.  The evolution of life forces from primitive forms to primates disallows for a special creation of Adam and Eve.  Science tracing the DNA of the genes of the human primates, determine that its origin could not have been from one couple but multiple couples.  Mind you, this information has not originated from me...I am only conveying the findings of science, which you refuse to accept...that is anti science.

Same old.  Same old.  Until the UA system starts consolidating satellite campuses, adopts distance education as the primary vehicle for delivering education - canned, VR-based coursework - and adopting other ways to deliver world class education, they are simply rearranging the deck chairs on their own personal Titanic.

"The disaster in Syria was set in motion by the U.S. and its attempt to depose Assad.

The ""rebels"" committed countless atrocities against the civilian population of eastern Aleppo and used them as human shields. It is shameful but totally predictable that the Western mainstream media and its so-called journalists have chosen to ignore the fact that Obama's regime change policy in the Middle East was at the root of the enormous human suffering in the region.

Of G 7 leaders in power during the global collapse in Q4 of 2008, only Harper and Germany's Merkel won subsequent elections and only Harper increased his share of votes and seats.  Uniting 2 feuding, fractious parties he finished a strong 2nd in 2004 and then won 3 elections in row as the only PM ever to increase his vote % and seats in 3 elections 6-8-11) in a row.  He was also the only modern leader of a conservative party in a mature democracy to win (2011) the largest % of the immigrant vote.  Like King and Trudeau 1.0, he failed to match Laurier's 1908 feat of  winning 4 consecutive elections but the CPC did finish a strong 2nd in 2015, only 7% behind the Liberals in the popular vote and with 99 seats.  This was not humiliation but rather predictable voter fatigue and desire for change, for a new face and voice and promises.  In the final 2 weeks of the 2015 campaign, enough voters decided Trudeau was a better bet than Mulcair to beat Harper so Trudeau won.  Hardly a humiliation!	0

However, I'm a firm believer in ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  From all I read, the Bach Festival really ""ain't broke.""  If there's a demand for another festival incorporating a wider variety of classical composers and classical music, by all means start one.  It could start small and build its success over the years...just like the Bach Festival has done.  The U of O's Adm.  dictum seems to be ""If it ain't broke,..break it.""  Gary Crum"	0

Perversely, we give ever-expanded tax breaks to people for breeding and then make access to birth control and sex education as difficult as possible. IMO, sex education should be greatly expanded and birth control should be freely available to all. As far as those deductions and credits for breeding, they should remain in place for one child, not be added to for a second and be revoked entirely for those who choose to have a third.  Even the Pope has said that we're done with any need to be fruitful and multiply and that we should stop breeding like rabbits.	0

PHILCO3: The problem with a lot of the arguments favouring mass immigration is that they're based on speculative logic. In this case, were the premise of the author's case obviously valid, we'd have leaped ahead of the U.S. in economic performance by now as our legal immigration levels on a proportionate basis have far outstripped American levels for more than a generation. But this boost hasn't transpired. Meanwhile, in the real world, people living in places like Toronto and Vancouver experience the downside of immigration every day, including higher housing prices and rents, insufficient and overcrowded roads and transit, overstretched health care services and relatively static and in some cases declining wages. These problems aren't created by individual immigrants, but rather by politicians who haven't recognized and accommodated the legitimate interests of those already living in this country and who've failed to balance immigration policy with these interests.	0

"A welcome caution from Mr. Radwanski.  The CPC isn't just having ""a moment"" of vulnerability; they've been without coherent policies or a centre of gravity since the person who essentially created--and defined--them quit.  Stephen Harper ran the CPC pretty much as a dictatorship, and attracted followers with few viable policy ideas of their own to offer. Their main values to him were blind obedience and a talent for sneering at the opposition. The vacuum Harper left won't easily be filled--especially since  his approaches to policy and governing have already been rejected by voters.  What are the alternatives--to both Harper and his policies?  The party needs to be redefined, and that is what this leadership race is really about. It's not just about who will be crowned leader of a party with a long-established set of broadly attractive policies. They're starting almost from scratch, and just being opposed to the current government, as they are now, isn't enough to win them power."	0

"You may live on the earth like it's just a ""host,"" but I don't. Neither did most of our ancestors over the past 200,000 years.  I disagree regarding the ""genius,"" also.

So far as extinction goes, your question is ridiculous. Obviously, prior extinctions were due to natural causes and not the result of any life form on earth. Dead may be equally dead wherever we find it, but all dying is not the same. There are accidents, illness, peaceful old age death, and there is murder.  Murder in all its forms, including of the earth, is not genius; it's evil.   We may be techno-magical geniuses (according to ourselves), but we can't make life as the earth does.

I think in the long term it will be devastating to America. Trump's vision is as short as his tweets. For example by boycotting Bombardier he will affect $2.4 billion worth of American product that actually goes into the Canadian made jet.  The rest of the world is already tired of him and unfortunately I suspect American tourists will be back to sewing Canadian flags on their knapsacks again	0
Unless you go to a race track, a car like that is a compete waste.  What's the point of having so much power if one can't play with it.   I guess if you are living for your ego, then go buy one.

Home advantage makes a huge difference. Aussies should be familiar with their own surfing beaches. Australia does have good surfers.

Many things must not be compromised. The Constitution and Existing Laws for a start. No one including Judges and POTUS are above the Law. A RED traffic light means STOP ,with some flexibility for justified first responders. There's too much tolerance and compromise toward anti social anarchy. Stamp that out. Lawful  demonstrations and civilized protest signs only. Stop giving-in to screaming provocateurs on the streets and the silly politicians who do nothing but block helping Americans improve their lives. No compromise without a better idea. Anything that contradicts that simple goal of decent behavior and Existing Laws must get a big fat RED LIGHT, nothing less.	0

"An ""adult"" is merely considered fully grown. Society seems to place this in consideration of criminal culpability. In which case, 18 can be near universally accepted as a point in which a person is capable of understanding right/wrong while simulataneously weighing the consequences of their actions. Being considered an infant/toddler/youth/teenager is just a number whereas adult/juvenile brings their roles in society into consideration.  At 18...he is able to buy a gun, drive a 10 thousand pound vehicle, fly a plane, drive a boat and even pay his federal taxes...he is very much an adult."	0

But, most human family members don't bark :) that's an important thing to remember. I'm a dog owner now and barking irritates me so training my pups to limit barking is super necessary. Seems to me that after the first time the pup got shot with pellets, that either a) I wouldn't let them outside alone or b) pay attention when my dog is outside and make sure they aren't barking and annoying the whole neighborhood to cause them to get shot. When my daughter was an infant and I stayed at home with her, the neighbors let their dog out at 6 am and it would bark and wake my daughter up. People don't understand how loud and annoying their pets can be to others, especially in neighborhoods with houses so close together.	0

"The verdict's in as to whether Ganot can coach. He can, and he and his staff did a fabulous job this season. The jury's still out as to whether Ganot can recruit, which is the lifeblood of any sports program. Still, he's had to recruit with one hand tied behind his back, courtesy of Gib & NCAA. He's still not in an ideal situation since the sanctions weren't lifted until a week ago, but let's see what he can do with TWO available scholarships.   My two cents: PG (JUCO if he can find a good one) and an athletic high school post player who can be groomed by Thomas and Johnson next year. Avea is long and athletic, and maybe he's not regarded as highly because he's a ""local boy"" and people are skeptical about competition in Hawaii. But I think he's got a big upside, and can see him developing into a Noah-Allen-type player in a couple of years."	0

"Most if not all with large levels of anti-Semitism in their histories. In any event, in the words of Yogi Berra ""it ain't over 'till it's over"". The resolution cannot be applied retroactively and has no immediate practical consequences. Since it was adopted under Chapter 6 of the United Nations Charter, it cannot be forced on Israel. Only resolutions passed under Chapter 7 can be imposed. This will allow Israel to mitigate the damages caused by the resolution, mostly with the help of US President-elect Donald Trump, who will also be able to veto future resolutions.  And that Trump himself tweeted: ""As to the UN, things will be different after Jan. 20th."" One of the existing possibilities is for Trump to threaten to cut the UN's funding if it tries to impose sanctions on Israel.  And that even if the UN attempts to impose a further anti-Israel resolution it is likely that Trump will veto it.  In the words of Karen Carpenter, ""we've only just begun""."	0

Jane, you don't understand.  It's not about rights,  it's about the progressive agenda.

That is a silly argument.  Individually you pay no more or no less than anyone else based on federal tax rates.

I am simply commenting on the article and providing my opinion that the manner in which MRS Harris appears to have approached the Premier invited the response that she received.

It is possible to hire both the best qualified people and fill a quota because many of the white cis men previously hired WERE NEVER THE BEST just the most acceptable.

"I disagree. First of all, our traffic planners and engineers all come from the school of ""as many cars through as fast as possible, and shoe-horn in any pedestrian/cyclist/disabled stuff whether it works or not"", so we have failure guaranteed.  Secondly, all these constructs do is reinforce the habit of driving as fast as one perceives is possible. That's exactly our problem now; motorists don't restrain themselves and thus add tremendously to the danger they create.  Traffic enforcement, when done well and vigorously, changes behavior and habits in such a way that motorists learn to control themselves and stop seeking the thrill of going as fast as they think is possible. The fines don't even have to be large, as long as the enforcement is consistent enough that people think they will be caught if they roll the stop sign, speed or fail to maintain their lane without cause.  I've lived with both (not locally, mind you), and I assure you the roads were much safer with enforcement."	0

And would that have been any better for Canada? Would the astronaut have inspired the same excitement and ushered in an era of change? And, in any case, that astronaut is still on the team, and making his contribution. Trudeau is a leader for our times, and the world is impressed. It's doubtful that the astronaut would have captivated Canadians and the world in the same way. Nor would he have appealed to youth in the way Trudeau does. A doctorate is not necessarily the best equipment for a political leader. But I do understand that you underestimate the intelligence and competence of J. Trudeau. Just watch him!	0
America dodged a bullet with Hillary! What a shrieking clown this woman is.  The Dems really don’t get it, do they?  Listen, we hated paying through the nose for Obamacare. We hate when our tax dollars pay for refugees and illegals.  The government destroys EVERYTHING it touches.  Just butt out of our lives, please.  My cell phone is just $25/month from Tmobile. My auto insurance is also just $25/month from Panda. Why? Cause the free market works!    Take your socialist agendas and shove them where the sun don’t shine.    Hillary supporters are mad and saying it's Russia's fault for exposing the corruption on Hillary.. lol Anyone else think this is funny?	1
First of all hitting a positive react button, ON YOUR OWN POST, demonstrates to the readers not only your insecurity but your intellectual level.   When people are on the hustings the reality of actually holding office is distant and almost unknown. Look at your Trudeau who said he was going to balance the budget, reform parliament, buy new ships for the Navy after cancelling the F35 program... the list goes on and on and is no different from Trump.   You are flying by the seat of your pants posting ignorance like that.	0
actually, the vast majority with these worthless degrees I wouldn't wipe my %$# with, are why so many of these people are deep in debt for the rest of their life trying to pay off these loans.

"There was an African American Church in N.C. spray painted w/ ""Trump"" and burned to the ground  right after the election....It was marked & set fire by a liberal to make Pres. Trumps election look evil. An anti-Semite attack in New York after the election was attributed to a liberal woman who wanted to prove electing Pres. Trump was a bad, racist idea. The attacks and murders on Jewish people in Europe are often from the  Muslim community. There was an attack on a Muslim business right here in Anchorage after 9/11 and we found out it was the Muslim business owner that trashed his own shop (Mr. Maad) SO......yeah, a spike in hate crimes against Jewish people could be coming from a lot of different places, hopefully this is a crime that can be solved and then we will know."	0
"I am a big teacher fan.  Teachers do wonderful work and are our collective future.  Please, Everett and Mukilteo teachers, don't use the ""it's for the kids"" argument when you are among the highest paid teachers in the State.  That self-serving argument doesn't fly.  Go to Olympia and ""educate"" our legislators of your classroom need, where there are program funding deficits, and help them find the right answer.   A strike threat is premature.

"Just an import clarification, the article mentions ""elective surgery"".  So, you may think that  if it takes 3 months to get a nose job, who cares?  And if that was the case I would agree with you.  But in Canada, or Ontario at least, elective surgery is any surgery that isn't immediately needed i.e. car accident victims. I have a friend who was told to stop working immediately, go on disability insurance, and not to do anything remotely physical as he needed a triple by-pass and any activity could result in a heart attack.  He had to wait about 6 weeks for surgery (not an inordinate about of time, but still scary) but was warned he could be bumped because his surgery was elective.  Go figure."	0
"Whatever success you enjoy today is the result of  the U.S. Rather than write something that reads like it's from North Korea, the real accomplishment is that the U.S., as evil as it is considered in Canada, never in the past 150 years just spent a weekend taking what it wanted like Russia or China.  You've glossed over so much that is inconsistent with your Canadian values, from military sales to the worst human rights violator to covering up large numbers of war crimes in Afghanistan involving torture to not just discrimination but human rights violations to using the 40,000 carefully chosen Syrians as numbers in a political stunt would tone down the self praise of a lesser country.   It's a media like this that makes it unpatriotic to complain, thus a mediocre health care system and an Archie Bunker 1970's well mocked line of ""if you don't like it here go someplace else"", ""my country love it or leave it"". This reads more like it's describing a cult than a country."	0
"""Isn't it fun to play chess with living pieces?""  Yes.  To continue the fun.  There is a story about (I think) one of the citizen-democracies in an ancient Greek city-state. When the citizenry met to discuss and plan the affairs of the city, any citizen wanting to make a proposal did so with a noose around his neck.  If the citizenry found the proposal unacceptable, the noose was fatally tightened.  Might this be a useful strategy to apply to bishops, cardinals, popes, and other church functionaries?"	0
Ironically, the US will likely do just that. They're already pretty much on track to hit their 2020 goal of an 18% drop (currently 16% below 2005 and falling about 2% a year).

"How can you post that and read Matthew 25 ""I was a stranger and you welcomed me""?  I am the grandson of an immigrant.  My grandfather came to this country from Portugal when he was 21 with ""little to offer in the way of economic improvement"".  He wanted the opportunities that America represented.  He worked hard (he collected garbage for a small town in Massachusetts), married and had three daughters, who had children, who had children.  His descendants honor his memory by the commitment that he made, the values he modelled, through the contributions that we have made.  If it is easier for you, think of him as an unborn fetus."	0
Ivan Illich used to argue that institutions weave ther magic by laying claim to some area of human need (spiritual meaning, health, learning), which they can then offer back to the very people who once had little need for them. So instead of prayer and thansksgiving, we get Sunday services guided by religious professionals; instead of the wonder of learning we get school-taught education; instead of healthly living we get doctor-delivered health care. Maybe before people learn again to trust institutions, those institutions have to trust people.	0

@Simone maleschewki - thanks for posting.    It just confirms what many of us have worked out over the years, that Post Media's ownership of both Vancouver dailies with editorial direction to it's columnists and reporters has resulted in a smooth (smoother) ride for the BC Liberals.  And nowhere was this more glaringly obvious than in the real estate fiasco here in metro Vancouver. You could clearly see that Post media had a gag order on reporting, and commentary, even to the extent of closing public commentary in their online papers.	0

"Paranoid much?  Trump has a history of deleting subpoenaed emails and certain business records and worse, of preemptively destroying them almost immediately when he's engaged in slimy business practices, despite the fact they are required to be kept by law. ""Business owners must comply with government requirements regarding recordkeeping. A company's records prove the amount of taxes it owes, details its hiring practices, shows compliance with regulations and reports many other types of business activities. The amount of time a company must keep these records on file depends on the type of record involved and the time limitations on the underlying activity that the document describes or substantiates.""

"Good news for health insurance CEOs, though! The ACA limited corporate deductions for CEO compensation to $500,000 per year. That would all now be rolled back so all the milliions they receive would be considered a deductible corporate expense, considered ""reasonable and necessary.""    Premiums for older people would increase substantially, because instead of the oldest being charged 3 times what the youngest pay, the rate would be 5 times what the youngest pay.    Individual mandate and the employer mandate are also gone, but instead if someone goes without coverage for 60 days, they will have to pay 130 percent of the premium rate for that year. Instead of paying a penalty to the federal government, they will pay the insurer, so it works out to be sort of a payday loan thing.    Limits for Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts are lifted, which benefits high-earners."	0

I would like to think that our market, the goods we produce that Americans want, are our cards to play, not one man who has never negotiated one business deal in his life. The Liberal cheerleaders conveniently ignore the history after the election while singing the praise of Trudeau. The child care benefit was shamefull example of vote buying and it worked , who would turn down money. This wasn't seasoned leadership, this was simply taking money from one segment of the population and giving it others. Turns out they didn't collect enough from the others so now everyone pays. Meanwhile its gradually clawed back with the cancellation of previous tax credits, income splitting and the big one yet to come, carbon taxes. Election reform went no where, defence is still a mess, no movement on aboriginal issues, the inquiry is a shambles and the cancellation of the pipeline alienated the west. NAFTA is out of his hands fortunately,for if it was we could expect another fiasco.	0

"""So if Congress once again outlawed assault rifles, the people who own them would have to consider that possession is against the law and deal with it.""  I understand that new assault rifles (as a subclass of machineguns) are already banned under a 1986 federal gun act, but there is a grandfather clause for firearms that were lawful in 1986 prior to the act.  Perhaps the author is referring to the now-expired 1994 ""Federal Assault Weapons Ban"", which only banned certain types of firearms, but there was a grandfather clause for existing firearms that were otherwise lawful on the date the ban was put in place.  It did not make possession of grandfathered firearms against the law."	0

Just 38 per cent of those surveyed said they would oppose tax hikes for those purposes.""  The bottom 50% of taxpayers pay next to nothing for income taxes, so of course those people would say they support higher income taxes for improved heath services.  They know they won't be asked to shoulder the bill.  The 38% opposed are those who know they will be the ones paying the increase, as they are already paying all the bills.

Weinandy's points to Francis all mark a man who fundamentally likes authoritarian rule in the church.  He feels the need for Right and Wrong answers to everything, when in fact many answers are right and wrong at the same time.  The idea that he could ask Jesus to show him, Weinandy, a particular sign of Weinandy's own making is in fact delusional.  Since he belonged to a reactionary click in the church, what type of friend did he think he might meet?  He deluded himself into believing that his friend was sent by Jesus when in fact he would only recognize as a friend members of his on click. Anyone of these would do and by talking about his own writings, he would have been encouraged by any one of them to continue.  He did not meet just anyone, he met a person selected not by Jesus but a person in his own click of belief.  This is a common delusion of reactionary thought.

Agreed that it's a large amount of money, but it probably includes the gas line to the coast and maybe the cost of drilling out the gas field.

The interest cost will be very high.  The plant will have to run flat out just to pay the interest.  In other words, the banks will do well but the energy companies...not so much.

You are right.  No way I can make 40 million off a tear down to protect some rich russian's assets from his wife.  I admit, I just don't understand how this works.  You spend 40 million to hide it from your wife?  Wouldn't it be easier to just give her an extra 20 million?  You would still be 20 million ahead?  But I admit, I am doing ok under the Donald so far.  But I doubt this will last.  Corruption generally doesn't keep the stock market up for long.    I wonder if republicans will ever find the guts to demand to see the Donald's tax returns?  By the way Dragon, whatis in your wallet?  Has the Donald gotten you a new minimum wage job jet?	0

Quebec has never held a single referendum in which even a simple majority voted for sovereignty.  On the other hand, Nova Scotia (which held 50% of the country’s capital at the time of Confederation in 1867) held one in which 65% of Provincial voters did so.  My advice to Catalonians would be to go and never once look back.  New Scotland will be free.	0
Some years ago I had the honor of meeting (then Congressman) Mike Pence, and this man is the epitome of class, humility, decency and grace.  Much like Justice Gorsuch, any individual who can, with a straight face, throw baseless and offensive criticisms at such men are truly nothing more than shameless political hacks or, more likely, just desperate, whining, snowflake liberals who simply cannot get over the fact that they LOST.   If you don't like Mike Pence or Neil Gorsuch then it truly sucks to be you, because Gorsuch will be serving our nation in the SCOTUS for decades to come and Mike Pence will--barring some catastrophic event--be our next President.  The future of our nation looks amazing.	0

Don't count on taxpayers helping out by spending money in the local economy.

"The imposition of a 20% border tax would mean a government-caused 20% (and likely more) increase in all imported goods coming into the States from Mexico and later,  a range of countries.  One wonders how well this will go down to the tax-averse American consumers. Among other things, it means that actual American tax-payers , not Mexico, will pay for the Wall.  Of course one could argue that few Americans would purchase goods made in Mexico so the border tax could end up lasting for an extremely long time as it would take decades to pay back the costs of building the wall.  And decades to ""pay back"" the amortized construction costs of the Wall to the US gov't. Let's not even consider what this tax would also do to the Mexican economy and the socio-economic conditions of their people. Is it smart foreign policy to cause tens of millions living on your southern border to hate and despise you? I think not. Someone had best call in the grown-ups to Washington and fast!"	0
Jolan - The fuel costs are almost identical over 5 years. The reason I picked what I did is because of performance factors and that both cars were running naturally aspirated 6 cylinder engines whereas the 330 has a Turbo 6. The Lexus IS 250 is nowhere near the performer of the BMW and therefore is not a good comparison. To quote Motortrend, “the Lexus IS250 is a good car, but when placed head-to-head against long-time class leaders such as the Audi A4, BMW 3-Series, or Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the flaws in the IS250 start to show, and it can be seen that it isn’t quite the complete package. My point is thought that it gets tiring seeing the same comment from the same person about German cars. If they truly were that bad then their reputation would kill sales. Obviously this is not the case.	0

Of course.  This thing was deliberately over-built.  Why?  So construction trade-unions & contractors could get a big fat project.  It's a feature not a bug.

Surprising that Michael Babad missed the release of real GDP estimates for 2016 by StatCan. When he was interviewed by Don Martin on PowerPlay after the release of his budget, Finance Minister Sousa talked about Ontario leading the country in growth. This is not confirmed by these estimates. Ontario's growth rate was a very good 2.6%, but just barely ahead of Manitoba and PEI at 2.4%. Much higher growth rates than Ontario's were posted by Yukon (8.2%), Nunavut (3.9%) and BC (3.7%).	0

"The answer is ""There is no money in building affordable housing or assisting the homeless"" the advocates for affordable housing and the homeless do not have deep pockets, special interest groups help politicians build their war chests.The Carrot is always dangling in front of the advocates for affordable housing and the homeless,just so that they can be kept in line promoting the Rail Project.Remember, the politicians said ""affordable housing can't be build until the rail is completed"" and I asked ""why"" it's because of the way funding goes.The affordable housing and homeless advocates will be left behind with the beautiful architectural renditions of what could have been!

Republicans were is such a rush to provide tax cuts for the super-wealthy that they didn't think taking healthcare away from 24 million people would be a serious obstacle. It didn't help that, according to Republicans who met with him,  Trump wasn't prepared to negotiate because he simply hadn't taken the time to become familiar with the details of the bills or with how healthcare works; inviting Republican Representatives to go bowling at the White House wasn't enough to convince them to support a bill that even Trump suspected was a turkey. When he could have been doing a little homework so that he could negotiate intelligently, he was playing golf instead. Of course, the plan he bragged about during his campaign never existed at all and his campaign promises were meaningless.	0

From reading your comments it seems you were away during the snowfall so did not get a chance to shovel and reduce the amount of the bags of  ice melt/salt that you need to now fix your driveway and sidewalk.  And now you cannot locate further salt.  Fair comment.  But the majority of residents could have shoveled the snow when it first fell,  thus lessening the need for ice melt to deal with what was left on the pavement.  I see this is my neighbourhood, where some neighbours did not shovel and expected it to melt away. And that did not happen.  We hardly used up one bag because we constantly cleared the snow.  With tonight's forecasted snowfall we will again be out there clearing whatever lands, and will only need a small amount of ice melt to keep it clear.  I spent much of my childhood in Winnipeg. maybe that makes a difference.	0

Funny, but about .027% claim they are innocent. Nice adherence, though, to urban myth. Where do you think it originated, perhaps in the fact that pro forma nearly 100% of defendants plead not guilty at arraignment?  Thanks, theairdog, but I am a criminal justice expert, so I know how it works. However, the jury doesn't get to say what evidence is admissible, now, does it? So the government does have a hand in it. Is it a jury of one's peers that reviews the briefs on appeal? No. Now, of all the millions of people convicted of crime in this country, how many of those people maintained their not guilty plea and demanded a trial. Very few. So your statistics are disingenuous. Of course, how many cases--take O.J., for example--where the defendant was objectively guilty, did the state break the law in building the case. Now, that number approaches 100%. Law enforcement cannot help themselves, and they believe in their cause (and so do others), so you get dirty cops, prosecutors, judges, ..	0

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism Patriotism is an emotional attachment to a nation which an individual recognizes as their homeland. This attachment, also known as national feeling or national pride, can be viewed in terms of different features relating to one's own nation, including ethnic, cultural, political or historical aspects. It encompasses a set of concepts closely related to those of nationalism. An excess of patriotism in the defense of a nation is called chauvinism.  Chauvinism: exaggerated or aggressive patriotism: excessive or prejudiced loyalty or support for one's own cause, group, or gender  Lot to be said about male chauvinism. Studies show that people of low intelligence tend to lean toward chauvinism, it is considered a defense mechanism like condescending attitudes.	0
Besides the dubious cost-benefit ratio of this Biki project, the main criticism of it should be that it and other non-Biki bikes are taking up entire lanes, which supposedly is the reason why at-grade rail won't work in the city.  And if bicycles are going to do that, they need to pay their fair share of road taxes.  Currently there is only a one-time small registration fee requirement for bikes.  Even that is not enforced as we see almost all bikes on using the road do not even have that one-time registration.  To be fair, Biki and other bikes on the road need to pay their fair share via annual registration fees for their significant road usage.  Do the Biki cycles have to pay even that one-time registration fee of about $15?	0

Contact your congressmen and tell them- rent control helps nobody. As landlords see their rights and options removed they are less likely to maintain property, be reasonable with tenants or seek higher occupancy over higher rents. As Tenants see more entitlements they will move to demanding more for less, making real estate a less appealing investment. Quality goes down, price goes up, and all because the legislature can't stop passing laws.  Lets ask them to repeal a law for every new one they create. That would be incentive to only create laws that make sense.	0

The answer may be two-fold: if your business is banking on scoring government tenders to exist, never mind grow, you have a flawed business plan. Too many black businesses imo thinks that a tender is the answer to all their woes. In fact, doing business with the state is a nightmare. Unless you are connected. And then it's not business anyway.  Secondly, your example of the board meeting doesn't surprise. To have someone parachuted into essentially confidential discussions in a highly competitive area would unsettle anyone.  Your entire story seems to based on some kind of entitlement. Talent, skin color, even ability, has less to do with business than confidence. That's why it's good to start small, and build up a track record, and make sure people can see what you've done. Too many people jump into the deep end and end up sinking, and  then blame the world. Or white business.	0

Trump doesn't exactly give us any choice on the matter.  He has threatened NAFTA, and put tariffs on our softwood lumber and Bombardier.  70% of our trade is with the US. Trump's threats on Canada's trade is an existential threat because of how much we rely on them. Trudeau is just doing what's necessary. We need to diversify our trade, or give US free reign to wreck our economy whenever they see fit.  FTA with the EU and China needs to happen at all costs at this point. Not sure Canadians realize how much risk we put ourselves in by relying so heavily on the US. North Korea needs China less than Canada needs the US based on these numbers alone.    (I have very little sympathy for Bombardier, but the US's little feet stomping is ridiculous given that the US subsidizes Boeing).	0

"Jesus did not have his back to the disciples at the Last Supper.  They saw Jesus, his face, heard his words.    The geographical/liturgical Jerusalem has nothing to do with it.  Catholics are from all over the globe.  They should be able to LOOK, SEE, and HEAR what is happening at the altar.  As far as the priest making the Mass about himself----the altar is the table of offering, of sacrifice--which the priest kisses as he first approaches the altar at the beginning of Mass.  All who approach the altar, bow to the altar---not to the priest.  Your comments about the priest's appearance is stretching it.  Only the Hindus believe that the highest form of union with the Deity is to be completely 'subsumed' like a drop of water in the ocean.  The priests PRESIDES as a complete human person and we, the congregation, as complete human persons bring WHO we are to the TABLE.  Jesus never stated that all who ""do this in memory of me"" must be ""subsumed."""	0
"You are right to be concerned about the unhealthy wood smoke pollution in Hoquiam. However, the problem is not as easy to solve as simply burning ""good"" wood or cleaning a chimney -- simple solutions like that are promoted by the hearth industry because they are good for business. They do little, however, for public health.   One problem with wood smoke is not that the particles are large, but rather they are extremely small -- so small they behave like gases. They infiltrate into well-insulated homes even when the windows are shut, and they pass through the lungs and into the bloodstream, where they are then carried throughout the body causing inflammation and can trigger asthma attacks, strokes and heart attacks.   Wood burning is simply too polluting and should be phased out entirely in residential areas. For an overview of the public health research and science see the website for Doctors and Scientists Against Wood Smoke Pollution: woodsmokepollution.org."	0

I was approached by a sales agent for an automated dispenser.  The 5-year amortized cost, including capital expenditures, software/hardware support, maintenance and interest was $12.50/hour.  After capital costs are covered (5 years), the costing drops below $6/hour.  The machine has an estimated 20 year life.  Purely from a business standpoint, while automation is less prone to error, fatigue, or personal drama, living workers provide more versatility in the workplace, and so should be priced at a higher premium.  Once the gap between the price of automation (which is a bit lower now) and workers (rising) exceeds that premium, it is hard to justify not making the investment - at the expense of the employee's position.	0

"I didn't make the claim; I quoted it from the article. The School board apparently agreed with those who felt they shouldn't be on one list for students ( doesn't mention what grade level), but was okay for seniors. Sounds reasonable to me. I didn't view it as censorship, as most commenters here apparently do. The extremism in these comments to the article is far more disturbing to me than the School board's actions. The color Purple is a great story, the Kite runner was a very good movie but never read the book, and my own person view of Salinger was that he was a messed up individual, and shouldn't be used as a role model ( no matter how good his writing ability was).   My only point is : ""kids are already into ......... anyway"" ( as a number of commenters wrote) is not a good excuse for failing to give careful thought to what kids are exposed to and when it is best for them."	0
"""Indigenous birds do not die in any significant numbers from cats.""  Are you sure about that?  If each of the estimated 300,000 cats on Oahu eat two birds per week (not indigenous birds, but birds in general) that is 600,000 birds per week or 31,200,000 per year.  Let's say those numbers are way off: say there are only 50,000 cats on Oahu, and they average one bird per week: 50,000 birds per week, so over a year they eat 2,600,000 birds.  Are 2,600,000 birds per year an issue with species survival, much less flourishing?  I have no idea what the cat population is in the mountains, where so many indigenous birds live, but to the extent there are cats up there, they prey on birds. To the extent they are in lower ecosystems, they prevent the indigenous birds from expanding their ranges, increasing their numbers, and stabilizing their populations.  Feral cats should not be conflated with cute and lovable house pets. Feral cats are a very serious problem predator. They should wiped out."	0

"Yes, a true tale that was blurted out by one of his buddies during a speech given from a podium as I recall.  The old gentleman didn't intend to shame him; I think it just came as a ""stream of consciousness"" memory.  (And possibly Inouye didn't even have the ring by then, but I should think that if he did, then efforts would have been made to return the ring to the dead French woman's family.)  Rules exist covering looting civilian and enemy dead or enemy prisoners, however, whether they were enforced really depended upon your commanding officer.  Regarding just enemy POWs, items (e.g. documents) could be legally confiscated for intelligence purposes, and sometimes returned if practicable.  However, other items not weapons but of personal or sentimental value, including cash, were supposedly off limits, or if taken for ""safe keeping"" required a legible receipt of some kind.

The real presence in Communion is only real when ingested.  Before so its an icon and after it is bread for the body.  The focus on confessing each mortal sin and all the various scruples around confession - and on receiving when sins are only serious in the eyes of the Church and not in real life - and the old practice of priests having to get every word of the consecration correct at pain of mortal sin all speak of magic and superstition.  The literalism on divorce is superstition and bad proof texting.  Indeed, talking about the validity of marriage rather than accepting the need for divorce is rank superstition.

Sorry, there's no ""free lunch"" - the people of Colorado are the employer.  Two common false premises pervade in your diatribe: 1. You have visions of things that don't exist - unions in Colorado. 2.

Every state that got an state income tax got a huge bureaucracy to support it. Look it up yourself. They got to enlarged the state government by hiring more people, more buildings, paperwork and all that. Doesn't that actually defeat the purpose of having taxes if a good part of that tax will be needed to set up this bureaucracy??? Public assistance is already in place. PFD is just a bonus to the residents. A freebie. I like it but I can easily live without it since I don't count on it being there every single year. Simple fact is, while small today, an income tax will increase. Death and taxes, right?  And the bureaucracy will increase as well. The taxation office will start small but in due time, it will be its own department. Every other state have followed this evolution. This department will probably be the fast growing branch of the state government and taxes will be rise to keep up with it. Huge government always start with income tax....always!!!	0

All of them also accept climate change as a scientific fac. CEO's of the largest US Companies have been callin on Trump to stay in the accord-- Exxon Mobil, Shell Oil, GE, 3M, Cummings, and many more-- more business leaders have contacted Trump to stay in the Paris Accord than on any issue so far.

Hey Jim, I agree that there are risks to holding a constitutional convention. However, I think there is value in having a conversation about our constitution, somewhat removed from the petty politics that prevail at the Capitol.

Interesting article, as usual, Pierre.  Still, isn’t there a possibility that the NPA could mount a bogus prosecution by presenting a contrived case that is so weak and disjointed as virtually to guarantee acquittal of the accused?  If so, upon acquittal, double jeopardy would apply, preventing any further prosecution on the same charges.  An added advantage would be that the NPA gets a superficial sheen of doing its job “without fear or favour,” even if the presiding court official were to rap them over the knuckles about the poverty of the case they presented.  Or is there something in law besides the NPA’s duties that would prevent such a gambit?

from Berig in Rochester, N.Y.  If anyone is truly concerned about the planet and MMGW they'd ditch their car and set examples for those they're trying to convince.  They'd also take other measures to live in sustainable harmony with Earth. No doubt our bodies are part and parcel of the tierra, undeniably so.  To assume that the ecology of this fragile and unique habitat will sustain every human adult to zoom around on four wheels hasn't seriously considered the impact car dependence will have in a decade or so.  We all know the many other benefits of parking these anatomical appendages once and for all.  I hope earthlings catch on.  You have to practice what you preach.	0
The information is finally out and it looks like the 15 year old held a gun to the teller's head.  They said he is being charged with robbery.  What about misconduct involving a weapon too. At least then he will have a record that may prevent him from passing a background check.  Charge him as an adult.  He might pull the trigger next time and if he does... the blood will be on the DA's hands! THis kid is a danger and threat to society!	0
"I am less worried about actual income problems as to medical needs, even with required medical tests. CPP and OAS would generally not apply to this group.  From: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/sponsor/pgp-apply-who.asp ""When you sponsor a parent or grandparent to become a permanent resident of Canada, you must promise to support that person and their dependants financially. Therefore, you have to meet certain income requirements. If you have previously sponsored relatives who later turned to the Canadian government for financial assistance, you may not be allowed to sponsor another person."""	0
Why does the media pretend that the 'Conservatives' are a still viable party? They are stuck in the 50's time-warp with only one way out.  That is - if Trudeau can make such a fool of himself that anyone can beat him.	1
"Well if I knew up to $20 million was coming down the pipe, I'd listen to everything my lawyer told me to do, including keeping quiet about my hatred of Canada and most importantly, ""finding religion"" with respect to the charter, after spending my formative years building bombs and fighting against Canada and its allies.  For true Khadr family feelings, you can listen to his sister and mom."	0
Wow, Ward 1, way to lump all gun owners as crazy.  Get right on that 2nd Amendment repeal effort.  How often do guns help prevent violence?  I read just the other day how a local concealed carry owner stopped a man with a knife, all without firing a shot.	0
Kennedy also sent in US Marshals to Mississippi to defend James Meredith, and, when they were attacked, sent in the US Army.	0
Congratulations!  Your planning and hard work are paying off and set  a fine example for others to follow. My major concern for you guys is do you have a life insurance policy big enough to pay the house off and provide for the  family for a few years if something dreadful happened? At your age I used to joke that I was worth much more dead than alive(using cheaper term insurance).   As the father of kids (in my mind) who are making similar good life decisions as yourselfs I'm sure your parents very proud of you as I am of my children and best of all the grandkids are close by.	0

Hillary started the birtherism.  That's a beyond doubt.  It's in the emails.   What I find odd is the following.  A person cannot join the military without producing a birth certificate, but to ask its president for one is racism.   This is case where liberals lose all credibility.  There's just no integrity left.	0

Why would I call for impeachment?  I honestly don't know much about what Manning leaked compared to Snowden.  I don't know if one put people's in harm's way or exposed intel resources.  I know the Pentagon Papers were important to ending Vietnam.  The government is wrong all the time.	0
Exactly, way too expensive, like I just said. And I hate to break it to you, but if you have insurance, you don't have a choice of a provider. And you also have to wait. Just like in other systems.	0

Thanks, Lumen.  I also hope that this will continue. Re Pandora -- it's not her name.  It's that, over a significant period of time, she has made many mean-spirited, hostile comments,  sometimes wrapped in faux concern or politeness.  I no longer interact with her, because I detest the snideness and the unwillingness to ever take responsibility for her hostile comments and generalizations and for continuing pointless exchanges.	0

"Can you point me to one post where any of the resident 'defenders of the faith' have actually accepted a contrary argument and conceded a point? I'll save you the time, Sarasi. There are none. Not one.   Even when one of them was actually lecturing the board about Burke's dubia, accusing us of not having read his letter, he then went on to say that the Cardinals were not just asking for one word, 'yes' or 'no' answers, they demanded explanations with the answers and they were entitled to them.  I directed the poster to the letter and the part where the Cardinals specifically say the polar opposite - i.e. That they want 'yes' or 'no' to each of the questions and NO ""theologising.""  I'm still waiting for the poster concerned to apologise. He simply went off and started the same uninformed cr@p with someone else. Trolls, all of them."	1
I don't think it's so much that people want the oil industry shut down. It's that people want reassurance that there won't be another oil spill like BP's Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon disaster. The explosion of Deepwater Horizon should've been prevented, but oil greed got in the way. No natural resource developer should be allowed to develop until they can PROVE with a very high degree of certainty that their development contingency plan puts the environment first before profits and greed. If developers can't reassure the public then they shouldn't be allowed to explore, drill, or pump. Period.	0

"""The swamp dwelling fake liberals in the vast middle class, especially the upper middle class white collar professionals hate Trump more robustly""  --  Actually, the people who hate Trump the most are his fellow Republicans.  Liberals in the US see him as a gift.  They couldn't have asked for a more incompetent example of right wing obtuseness to put before the voters for 2018 and 2020.  He's the gift that keeps on giving.  ."	0

"Except we don't know that, as no details have been released.  The only information you can provide to support your claim is the statement of AST to that effect.   And AST has provided no details to support their statement; it is just a claim, based on nothing verifiable.  And given by an agency that has a serious conflict of interest.  At the same time the agency has withheld from public information about the general circumstances of the shooting.  No statements have come forth, now four days hence.  The person may have been moments away from running over the officer and the police's quick action saved his life. Or he may have been shot when 50 feet away from any officer and driving 5 MPH.  We just don't know, because of the decisions of ""public servants"" to prevent the public from knowing what happened.  And by the time this information is released, the story will no longer be newsworthy; we'll probably never know."	0
And while the PUC is charged with setting rates that would allow the electric utility to provide safe and reliable electricity to the rate payers, they approved rates to be charged that allowed the utility to make profits at a level that the utility could invest in non-utility ventures.  All this on the backs of the citizens of Hawaii.  The fault lies with the PUC, which in turn lies with the ruling political party.  Another sad tale of the corruption in Hawaii politics.	0
Private sector media backed the wrong horse in 2015 and many denounced Justin Trudeau.  Now they have the gall (and lack of dignity) to come to PM Trudeau asking him to hobble the CBC and hand them some subsidies.  PM Trudeau no doubt has some faults but I think his memory is not one of them.	0

What do you mean?  Trudeau specifically never said a single word about Trump - for which some pillored him btw for not speaking.  Show me a single quote where he spoke out against Trump - seriously I challenge you to find one.	0
So you're saying that there is no point in striving for something better Doc? That we should just accept the lowest common denominator of human behaviour as normal? That we shouldn't sand against prejudice, and ignorance, and fear, and hate? Sorry but that's not good enough. We deserve better than that.  It's cute that you seem to think of Saint Apollinaire as some kind of Mayberry lost in time. It conveniently ignores the fact that there are many people in the town who support a Muslim cemetery and it ignores the fact that no reasonable grounds have been given for opposing it. Do you even know where it will be located? Behind an industrial park. Hardly an affront to the fabric of the town. Face it, you're afraid of people who don't look like you. Your whole schtick here is simply another attempt to vilify multiculturalism.   But tell you what - give me a reason to stop the Muslim cemetery. Show me that there is a logical reason it shouldn't be there.	0

I was tempted to cite the blatant conflict of interest of Conoco employees Senators Meyers and Micciche and the SB21 vote in arguing that Flynn should be allowed to participate. But upon reconsideration, I think it demonstrates the ethical integrity of the Assembly's Democratic majority and contrasts it to the contempt for ethical behavior of Meyers, Mecciche and their republican brethren in the legislature.   Kudos to Assembly members Eric Croft, Bill Evans, Elvi Gray-Jackson, Dick Traini, Tim Steele and Forrest Dunbar for believing that ethics still matter in Alaska.   It seems that republicans only care about ethics when they can bash a Democrat over the head with it.	0

They have had a lot of these in Walla Walla Washington recently.  Hopefully this is just the responsibility of just one incompetent supervisor and not a reflection of the entire organization.
